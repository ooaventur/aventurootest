# Aventurootest

Aventurootest is an Eleventy-powered news and magazine site. The Node/Eleventy
stack renders the public pages, while a collection of Python “autopost” scripts
pull curated RSS feeds, clean up the articles, and store them as JSON content
for the static build.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (or another version supported by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)).
- **npm** for managing JavaScript dependencies (bundled with Node.js).
- **Python 3.9+** for running the autopost utilities and unit tests.
  - The scripts work with the standard library, but installing
    [`trafilatura`](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura) and
    [`readability-lxml`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ReadabiliPy)
    is recommended for higher quality article extraction: `pip install
    trafilatura readability-lxml`.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install both the Node and Python tooling:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aventurootest

# Install Eleventy and other Node dependencies
npm install

# (Optional but recommended) set up an isolated Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -U pip trafilatura readability-lxml
```

The repository tracks generated articles in `data/posts.json`. The autopost
scripts update that file; Eleventy reads it when building the site.

## Building the site

Run Eleventy directly with `npx` or by using the npm script:

```bash
npx eleventy        # or: npm run build
```

This generates the static site inside the `_site/` directory.

## Running the autopost scripts

Each autopost module (news, travel, entertainment, etc.) lives in the
`autopost/` directory. They share a feed file (`feeds_*.txt`), a deduplication
database (`autopost/seen_all.json`), and write their results to
`data/posts.json`.

Common usage pattern:

```bash
# Pull the default set of news feeds
python autopost/pull_news.py

# Limit to a specific category or custom feed file
FEEDS_FILE=/path/to/feeds.txt CATEGORY="Travel" python autopost/pull_travel.py
```

Environment variables recognised by the scripts include:

- `FEEDS_FILE` – override the bundled feeds list.
- `CATEGORY` – restrict processing to one category.
- `MAX_PER_CAT`, `MAX_TOTAL`, `MAX_POSTS_PERSIST` – tune quantity limits.
- `FALLBACK_COVER`, `DEFAULT_AUTHOR`, `IMG_PROXY`, etc. – control cover images
  and metadata.

All autopost runs reuse `autopost/seen_all.json` to avoid duplicates. Removing
that file forces a full refresh.

## Testing

The Python tests validate the shared autopost utilities. Run the full suite
with:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

## Deployment notes

Netlify deploys the site with the command `npm run build` and publishes the
generated `_site/` directory (see `netlify.toml`). When hosting behind a path
prefix, Eleventy reads the following environment variables to determine the
base URL:

- `ELEVENTY_PATH_PREFIX`
- `BASE_PATH` (used by Netlify path prefix configurations)
- `PUBLIC_URL`

If none of those are set, the build falls back to auto-detecting GitHub Pages
deployments via `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, otherwise the site is rendered for the
root path (`/`)
