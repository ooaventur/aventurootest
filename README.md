# Aventurootest

This repository contains the Eleventy-based sources for the Aventuroo test site.

## Getting started

The `node_modules/` directory is intentionally not tracked in git. After cloning the project or pulling the latest changes, install the dependencies locally:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed you can build the static site with:

```bash
npm run build
```
