# Latest News Banners
The rotating banner creatives that appear in the home page's Latest News module
are configured in `data/banners.json`. Update that JSON file to swap in new
image URLs or destination links without editing the HTML templates.
# Relocating the Latest News module
Editors can move the Latest News block anywhere on the home page without
touching the JavaScript. Mark up the wrapper element with either the
`data-latest-news-block` attribute or the `latest-news-block` class (keeping the
`latest-news-block` id is optional but still supported). Inside that wrapper, add
the `data-latest-news-grid` attribute or `latest-news-grid` class to the element
that should receive the dynamically injected cards. For example:

```html
<div class="block latest-news-block" data-latest-news-block>
  <h1 class="block-title">Latest News</h1>
  <div class="block-body">
    <div class="row latest-news-grid" data-latest-news-grid></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The script searches for the new data attributes first and falls back to the
legacy ids, so existing templates continue to work.
