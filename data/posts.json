That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25% - the lowest level since late 2022.</p>\n    <p>The move - the bank's first rate cut since last December - is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US.</p>\n    <p>But today's move carries a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates.</p>\n    <p>\"Unemployment is still low but we're seeing downside risks,\" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the announcement.</p>\n    <p>That compared to the Fed's July update which described the job market as \"solid\".</p>\n    <p>Wednesday's cut was supported by 11 of the 12 voting members on the Fed's commitee. Stephen Miran, who is on temporary leave from his post leading Trump's Committee of Economic Advisers, voted for a bigger 0.5 percentage point cut.</p>\n    <p>In many ways, it is no surprise that the Fed, which sets interest rate policy independent of the White House, is cutting.</p>\n    <p>The inflation that ripped through the post-pandemic economy and prompted the bank to raise interest rates in 2022 has come down significantly.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, Europe, Canada and elsewhere, central banks have already responded with lower rates, while the Fed's own policymakers have said for months that they expected to lower borrowing costs by at least half a percentage point this year.</p>\n    <p>At the Fed's last meeting, two members of the board even backed a cut.</p>\n    <p>They were outvoted, as other members remained worried that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, tariffs and mass detentions of migrant workers, might cause inflation to flare back up again.</p>\n    <p>And it's true that the US in recent months has seen inflation tick higher. Prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to August, the fastest pace since January, and still above the Fed's 2% target.</p>\n    <p>But in recent weeks, those concerns have been eclipsed by weakness in the labour market. The US reported meagre job gains in August and July and an outright loss in June - the first such decline since 2020.</p>\n    <p>\"It really comes down to what we've seen in the jobs market - the deterioration that we've seen over the past few months,\" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, which is expecting rates to drop by 0.75 percentage points by the end of the year.</p>\n    <p>\"The Fed knows that when the labour market turns, it turns very quickly, so they're wanting to make sure they're not stepping on the brakes of the economy at the same time the labour market has already slowed.\"</p>\n    <p>At the news conference following the announcement, Powell emphasised that the unemployment rate remained low, at 4.3%, while acknowledging unusual disagreement among members about what to do next.</p>\n    <p>Forecasts released by the Fed suggest the Fed could lower interest rates by an additional 0.5 percentage points this year.</p>\n    <p>But seven members see no further need for reductions, while one member - who analysts said was likely Miran - thinks the rate should drop below 3%.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not a bad economy - we've seen much more challenging times,\" Powell said. \"But from a policy standpoint, it's challenging to know what to do. There are no risk-free paths right now. \"</p>\n    <p>Wednesday's move is unlikely to satisfy the president, who has spent months blasting the Fed's hesitance to cut rates, which he says should be as low as 1%.</p>\n    <p>On social media, he has called Powell \"a real dummy\", accusing him of holding back the economy by leaving interest rates too high for too long.</p>\n    <p>\"Too Late\" MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND. HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!\" Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting, referring to Powell.</p>\n    <p>Trump's pressure is not just rhetorical. He moved quickly to install Miran in time for this week's meeting after a short-term vacancy opened up last month.</p>\n    <p>His administration has also threatened Powell with firing and investigation and is locked in a legal battle over its effort to fire economist Lisa Cook, another member of the board.</p>\n    <p>To critics, Trump's moves amount to an assault on the Fed's independence that is unprecedented in recent history.</p>\n    <p>Powell spent much of the news conference ducking questions about whether he agreed.</p>\n    <p>Asked, for example, if he saw the fight over Cook as a threat to the bank's independence, he responded: \"I see it as a court case I think it would be inappropriate to comment on.\"</p>\n    <p>But whatever awkwardness in the air at this week's Fed meeting, analysts say they believe the Fed's decision to cut would have come regardless of Trump's campaign.</p>\n    <p>\"The president's policies are certainly causing the economic activity that is forcing the hand of the Fed,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.</p>\n    <p>\"The president's jawboning of the Fed to lower rates I think has had zero impact whatsoever.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>How are interest rates impacting you or your business? </i>\n      <strong>Get in touch here</strong>\n      <strong> </strong>\n      <i>or use the form below. </i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75y90pw0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

unbeaten 141 against South Africa last week</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Published</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <strong>First T20, Malahide</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Ireland 196-3 (20 overs): </strong>Tector 61* (36), Tucker 55 (36)</p>\n    <p><strong>England 197-6 (17.4 overs): </strong>Salt 89 (46)</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>England won by four wickets and lead series 1-0 </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Phil Salt again starred for England as they beat Ireland by four wickets in the first match of a three-game T20 series in Dublin.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The England opener smashed 89 off 46 deliveries but came up short of what would have been his second consecutive century when he was caught by Ross Adair with the final delivery of the 15th over.</p>\n    <p>By then, however, Salt had broken the back of the chase for England, who finished the job of chasing Ireland's 196-3 with more than two overs to spare.</p>\n    <p>Travelling without their all-format stars, England were captained by Jacob Bethell for the first time, with the 21-year-old hitting 24 off 16 balls before a tame swipe to extra cover just as he appeared to be going through the gears.</p>\n    <p>In what was their first international of any kind since a T20 win over West Indies on 15 June, Ireland will have felt their tally, which included half-centuries for both Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, was a competitive one.</p>\n    <p>But just five days after their stunning 304-2 against South Africa on a record-breaking night in Manchester, a much-changed England began their reply in emphatic fashion before Ireland battled back for some late wickets.</p>\n    <p>The win represented England's first victory over Ireland in the format in what was their second completed game, and the two sides will meet again at Malahide on Friday and Sunday.</p>\n    <h2>Tector and Tucker combine for Ireland</h2>\n    <p>On the day when Bethell became the youngest player to captain an English team, his first act as Harry Brook's stand-in skipper was to win the toss and put the hosts in to bat.</p>\n    <p>With all the pre-match talk about the amount of cricket, or lack thereof, played by Ireland in the build-up to this series, there will have been plenty of interest in how openers Paul Stirling and Ross Adair fared.</p>\n    <p>While there were certainly a few instances when the pair appeared to be searching for their rhythm in the early overs, Ireland were 49-0 at the end of the powerplay, with Stirling in particular providing some big hitting.</p>\n    <p>Of the skipper's quartet of sixes, two were driven onto the roof of the hospitality tent at the compact ground in north Dublin.</p>\n    <p>After providing the solid start, the opening pair fell in quick succession with Adair caught on the boundary by Phil Salt in the eighth over when attempting a sweep over the leg side off the bowling of Liam Dawson.</p>\n    <p>Nine deliveries and 10 runs later, Stirling followed after swiping at the bowling of Adil Rashid with Will Jacks taking the catch.</p>\n    <p>The arrivals of Harry Tector and then Lorcan Tucker to the crease saw Ireland run an increased number of singles for the remainder of their innings but Tector still added seven boundaries in his unbeaten 61 from 36 balls.</p>\n    <p>Tector, who brought up his own half-century with a drive for six, almost lasted to the end of the innings, only to edge the penultimate delivery into the gloves of Jos Buttler.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/0981/live/6f1fc490-93d7-11f0-9179-45b2a8e0a654.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Tector\"/>\n    <p>Harry Tector became the fourth man to score 1,500 T20 runs for Ireland</p>\n    <h2>England make light work of understrength Ireland bowling attack</h2>\n    <p>Without the services of Mark Adair and Josh Little in their attack, it was the left-arm spin of Matthew Humphreys who opened the Irish bowling against Phil Salt in the visiting opener's first innings since reaching a century off just 39 balls against South Africa at Old Trafford last week.</p>\n    <p>England quickly set about chasing down their target of 197.</p>\n    <p>After Barry McCarthy and Graham Hume could find no answer for England's big-hitting, Craig Young slightly slowed their rapid progress in the fourth over, before Humphreys' return saw Buttler sky one to Curtis Campher to fall for 28 off 10 balls.</p>\n    <p>Despite the loss of their first wicket, England still ended the powerplay on 84-1 with Salt's half-century coming off just 20 deliveries.</p>\n    <p>He would survive being caught off a Tector no-ball but continued to knock Ireland's bowlers to all corners of the ground.</p>\n    <p>Bethell's dismissal came after striking a six over the temporary stand before Gareth Delany marked his 100th Irish cap with the wicket off Rehan Ahmed.</p>\n    <p>Even after Hume took the wickets of Sam Curran and Salt in the 15th over, England always looked on course for victory with Jamie Overton ultimately providing the winning runs with 20 deliveries to spare.</p>\n    <h2>'It was about getting the job done' - what they said</h2>\n    <p><strong>England batter Phil Salt:</strong> \"I thought Ireland played well to get where they got. It was all about being confident and making that partnership with Jos to get off on the right foot.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>On missing out on the century:</strong> \"I was annoyed to get out but not too annoyed about that to be honest. Coming away from home to a new ground and new conditions. Just getting the job done in the first one, I'm happy enough about that. I was slightly annoyed about the way I got out but looking back, it might have been quite greedy.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>England captain Jacob Bethell:</strong> \"It feels pretty special. Winning the first one is always nice.</p>\n    <p>\"A great feeling and can't waiting to go again on Friday.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>Ireland captain Paul Stirling: </strong>\"We'll take all the positives we can out of it. I was happy to go out there and get going. Hopefully throughout this series we can improve in all areas. We couldn't have asked for much more from our batters. To score 196 in the end was great.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cewn0kd7l54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

This season United are not in Europe at all.</p>\n    <h2>Man Utd's growing transfer debt</h2>\n    <p>As ever, United's debt levels remain a talking point.</p>\n    <p>The long-term debt, which has effectively sat on the club since the Glazers bought it in 2005, remains at $650m, with the exchange rate on 30 June meaning it was £471.9m.</p>\n    <p>In addition, borrowings from the club's rolling credit facility had risen to £165.1m from £35.6m by 30 June.</p>\n    <p>On top of that, there is the amount owed in outstanding transfer fees.</p>\n    <p>United are not alone in paying fees in installments over a period of time and the precise amounts they have to pay and when are unclear.</p>\n    <p>However, they will form a significant part of the two 'trade and other payable' entries in the accounts released today that total £564.6m, up from £424.9m 12 months earlier.</p>\n    <p>Since 30 June, United have bought Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig and Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for fees club sources said totalled £156.8m.</p>\n    <p>Club officials have defended the outlay, saying it provides evidence of United's determination to arrest their slump and compete for major trophies again.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c87y3110dnzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>Watch Trump arrive in New York for his arraignment</p>\n<p>01:18</p>\n<p>What we covered here</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p>Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”</p>\n<p>In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.</p>\n<p>However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.</p>\n<p>The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.</p>\n<p>The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategy</p>\n<p>From CNN's Jeff Zeleny</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.</p>\n<p>But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump, gives an interview outside of Trump Tower on March 21 in New York City.</p>\n<p>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”</p>\n<p>On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.”</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>The former president met with attorneys at Trump Tower on the eve of his arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Kristen Holmes</p>\n<p>From left to right: Susan Necheles, Todd Blanche and Joe Tacopina.</p>\n<p>(Reuters/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>Trump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Photos: Trump arrives in New York City a day before his expected arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Photo Desk</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has landed in New York’s La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse.</p>\n<p>History was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury.

They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.</p>\n    <p>Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya.

We have no refuge in the south.\"</p>\n    <p>The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August.

A cut-glass shock-and-awe approach to hospitality designed to make a visiting leader like President Trump feel special.</p>\n    <p>The setting in St George's Hall inside Windsor Castle is a remarkable sight, a mix of medieval banquet and Harry Potter film.</p>\n    <p>Elaborately uniformed staff around the hall are as drilled as the soldiers who have been on parade during the day. The table settings, five glasses per person, are terrifyingly neat.</p>\n    <p>For Trump's visit, the 160 guests, sitting behind 1,452 pieces of cutlery, will be eating from a menu, written in French, which translates as:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hampshire Watercress Panna Cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad</li>\n      <li>Organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savoury infused jus</li>\n      <li>Vanilla ice cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached Victoria plums</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Guests have a generous wine list.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wiston Estate, Cuvée, 2016</li>\n      <li>Domaine Bonneau de Martray, Corton-Charlemagne, Grand Cru, 2018</li>\n      <li>Ridge Vineyards, Monte Bello, 2000</li>\n      <li>Pol Roger, Extra Cuvée de Réserve, 1998</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>After dinner drinks will be drowning in symbolism. It's a 1945 vintage port, in honour of Trump having been the 45th US president, although he does not drink.</p>\n    <p>There's a 1912 cognac, from the birth year of the president's Scottish-born mother.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/766c/live/3adc1640-93f8-11f0-8750-ed240c52ff67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media A place settings at the banquet table reads THE KING and has gold cutlery next to it\"/>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cx2q200d2vnt\">LIVE: Follow the latest from Trump's state visit to UK</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rynvlm6zjo\">What is the president doing during his visit?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqd70v496o\">In pictures: Trump and Melania meet the royals</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0x2vxl7gjo\">America's unofficial party house where presidents stay in London</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy857ddpjp4o\">Melania’s big hat, Kate’s feather brooch and other standout looks</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-aa033245-35e9-45e2-9209-616ebce4b971\">Security measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The Beast</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>If that doesn't seem enough there's a special cocktail, the Transatlantic Whisky Sour, which blends Johnnie Walker with the bright citrus of marmalade, with pecan foam and a toasted marshmallow on a biscuit.</p>\n    <h2>Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook</h2>\n    <p>President Trump's banquet in Windsor Castle is conspicuously missing celebrity faces or screen stars. Were there people in Hollywood, or even west London, who suddenly found they had to be somewhere else tonight?</p>\n    <p>There's not even a hardy royal perennial like Sir David Beckham or Sir Elton John.</p>\n    <p>Instead the guest list is heavy on political operators and tech bros. Apple boss <strong>Tim Cook</strong> is there, sitting next to the president's daughter, <strong>Tiffany Trump</strong>.</p>\n    <p>Press baron <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> is sitting next to Sir Keir Starmer's key adviser <strong>Morgan McSweeney</strong>. The small talk must be interesting when Trump is suing the Murdoch press for billions in the US.</p>\n    <p>Like at a wedding, guests must be checking the nameplates around the ornately-decorated table to see who they're sitting beside.</p>\n    <p>The \"head\" of the table is in the middle for the Windsor state banquet, with the King and president in the centre of a dining table that is 47m long.</p>\n    <p>President Trump, as the guest of honour, is placed between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales.</p>\n    <p>The nameplate for Trump says \"President of the United States of America\", although in capital letters, oddly reminiscent of his social media messages.</p>\n    <p>Facing them is the first lady, whose nameplate says \"Mrs Trump\", with Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales on either side of her.</p>\n    <p>The seating arrangement throws some interesting groupings. There's the <strong>US ambassador</strong> <strong>Warren Stephens</strong> flanked by <strong>Princess Anne</strong> on one side and <strong>Chancellor Rachel Reeves</strong> on the other.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> is beside mega-wealthy investor <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong>. If Conservative leader <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> is searching for ideas, she's sitting next to <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, chief executive of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI.</p>\n    <p>Golfer <strong>Nick Faldo</strong> and athlete <strong>Dame Kathleen Grainger</strong> are among the more prominent sports stars at the banquet.</p>\n    <p>On the walls are royal portraits and suits of armour and the ceiling is studded with the coats of arms of Knights of the Garter.</p>\n    <p>St George's Hall was rebuilt after the fire of 1992. So perhaps like many stories about the royals, it feels new and old at the same time.</p>\n    <p>According to the travelling US press pack, the choice of music at the banquet reflects some of President Trump's favourites. Maybe they have their own messages to the politicians listening.</p>\n    <p>It includes Nessun Dorma, meaning \"none shall sleep\" and You Can't Always Get What You Want.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef34/live/a99f61b0-109d-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, purple banner promoting the Royal Watch newsletter with text saying, “Insider stories and expert analysis in your inbox every week”.

A total of 30-40mm is forecast to fall widely, with up to 70mm in some locations.</p>\n    <p>It comes as a slow-moving weather front is forecast to stall across parts of Wales and northern England, bringing persistent outbreaks of rain. The rain will become increasingly heavy through the weekend as a new area of low pressure develops.</p>\n    <p>There may be some areas of localised flooding and tricky driving conditions especially as the rain turns heavier. Over the hills some areas could see as much as 100-150mm of rain.</p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland is close to this front so the weather could be quite wet in the far southeast , otherwise it probably won't be as wet as it has been over the last week or two.</p>\n    <p>Wet and windy weather in Scotland will clear to more showery conditions. It will turn colder here, perhaps even cold enough for some wintriness over the very tops of the Scottish mountains by the weekend.</p>\n    <p>In south-east England, the Midlands and East Anglia it will become much warmer over the next few days with temperatures set to soar up to 26C in some areas on Friday. Outbreaks of rain and cooler air will arrive over the weekend.</p>\n    <h2>How much rain has there already been?</h2>\n    <p>Already parts of the UK have received almost double their average September rainfall thanks to persistent south-westerly winds which have been responsible for bringing in a succession of areas of low pressure from the Atlantic.</p>\n    <p>It is these areas of the country, most exposed to these winds, which have seen the largest amounts of rain. Cardiff has seen more rainfall in September than the whole of summer.</p>\n    <p>But it is not just areas of Wales that has had a very wet start to the month, Northern Ireland, northwest and southern England have also been drenched.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/591d/live/25cec280-93bb-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" alt=\"A league table showing rainfall so far this month compared to the average\"/>\n    <p>It's been very wet so far this month in parts of the south and west</p>\n    <h2>When will the rain stop?</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2048/cpsprodpb/fd55/live/5cda23e0-93bc-11f0-bd0e-75d70011515a.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of a man walking his dog with beams of light shining through trees\"/>\n    <p>A change to much drier weather is on the way for the last week of September</p>\n    <p>High pressure is expected to return to the UK next week and will bring a much more settled spell of weather with some sunshine.</p>\n    <p>Temperatures will tend to be a little below average with a few pockets of rural frost.

Behind her is a well-kept garden with vibrant flowers and green shrubs.\"/>\n    <p>The Home Secretary has vowed to fight \"vexatious, last-minute claims\" after the deportation of an Eritrean man under the UK-France migrants returns deal was temporarily blocked.</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, the High Court granted the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, a \"short period of interim relief\" ahead of his deportation to France, which was sceduled for 09:00 BST on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the High Court decision, Shabana Mahmood said \"last minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable\".</p>\n    <p>The man, who arrived in the UK by small boat last month, argued he was a victim of modern slavery in an appeal made just hours before his flight.</p>\n    <p>In the first High Court challenge to the \"one in, one out\" scheme, the Eritrean man's lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office is set to appeal against the decision and is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to ensure it is not being misused.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood said: \"Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country's generosity.</p>\n    <p>\"I will fight to end vexatious, last-minute claims. I will robustly defend the British public's priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our border.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements. It is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Ministers agreed the \"one in, one out\" <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g2edx410wo\">pilot deal with France in July</a> to curb record small boat crossings this year.</p>\n    <p>The latest setback follows reports that the first flights to France left empty on Monday and Tuesday. Despite this, the first removals of migrants to France under the pilot scheme are still expected to go ahead this week.</p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.</p>\n    <p>France has reportedly said it will only accept a small initial contingent of deportations, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme in an effort to stop small boat crossings in the Channel.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

    "body": "<p>John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president.</p>\n<p>Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n<p>In early March, Swinney said it was \"unthinkable\" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>\n<p>Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question.</p>\n<p>Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to \"ethnic cleansing\".</p>\n<p>But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet.</p>\n<h2>Why has John Swinney's approach changed?</h2>\n<p>The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott.</p>\n<p>Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly.</p>\n<p>The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited.</p>\n<p>So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach?</p>\n<p>That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque.</p>\n<p>\"We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy.</p>\n<p>That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions.</p>\n<p>That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states.</p>\n<p>UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action?</p>\n<p>Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind.</p>\n<p>The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March.</p>\n<p>I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day.</p>\n<p>He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word.</p>\n<p>This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office.</p>\n<h2>Building a new relationship</h2>\n<p>It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were \"thank you\".</p>\n<p>Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words.</p>\n<p>A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney \"nasty\" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built.</p>\n<p>It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections.</p>\n<p>He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again.</p>\n<p>There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government.</p>\n<p>However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known.</p>\n<p>That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a \"terrific guy\".</p>\n<p>It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry.</p>\n<p>He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda.</p>\n<p>Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president.</p>\n<p>He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America.</p>\n<p>But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky.</p>\n<p>The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House.</p>\n<p>He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world.</p>\n<p>None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down.</p>\n<h2>Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal</h2>\n<p>While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential \"win-win\" business deal to Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky.</p>\n<p>A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK.</p>\n<p>Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too.</p>\n<p>If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up.</p>\n<p>If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an \"absolute blinder\".</p>\n<p>One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was \"smart politics\".</p>\n<p>What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge.</p>\n<p>They enabled him to run rings round them.</p>\n<p>The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The background is dense with vegetation, including trees and various plants. Both animals have their mouths half open as they chew on fruit.\"/>\n    <p>Wild chimpanzees have been found to consume the equivalent of a bottle of lager's alcohol a day from eating ripened fruit, scientists say.</p>\n    <p>They say this is evidence humans may have got our taste for alcohol from common primate ancestors who relied on fermented fruit - a source of sugar and alcohol - for food.</p>\n    <p>\"Human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this dietary heritage of our common ancestor with chimpanzees,\" said study researcher Aleksey Maro of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n    <p>Chimps, like many other animals, have been spotted feeding on ripe fruit lying on the forest floor, but this is the first study to make clear how much alcohol they might be consuming.</p>\n    <p>The research team measured the amount of ethanol, or pure alcohol, in fruits such as figs and plums eaten in large quantities by wild chimps in Côte d'Ivoire and Uganda.</p>\n    <p>Based on the amount of fruit they normally eat, the chimps were ingesting around 14 grams of ethanol - equivalent to nearly two UK units, or roughly one 330ml bottle of lager.</p>\n    <p>The fruits most commonly eaten were those highest in alcohol content.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ffe8/live/9145ab10-93d3-11f0-bab6-4787ef35d8ed.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Aleksey Maro A chimpanzee sits on a tree branch in a lush, green forest. The surroundings are dense with foliage, and the tree features clusters of figs hanging from its branches. The chimpanzee is centrally positioned but partially hidden by leaves and branches. Sunlight filters through the canopy.\"/>\n    <p>The research adds weight to the so-called \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis - the idea that the human appetite for alcohol was inherited from our primate ancestors.</p>\n    <p>This was first proposed by Prof Robert Dudley of the University of California, Berkeley, who is a co-researcher on the study.</p>\n    <p>Scientists were initially sceptical. But more observations of \"scrumping apes\" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team.</p>\n    <p>\"What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years,\" she told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>\"Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2310/live/a6526790-93d9-11f0-9179-45b2a8e0a654.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A chimpanzee in a forested setting, surrounded by dense green foliage.

Had they done so, \"this would clearly not improve their survival chances,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>According to the <a href=\"https://iucn.org/\">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a>, chimpanzees are endangered and the biggest threats they face include losing their forest homes to farming, logging and building roads or towns. </p>\n    <p>The research is published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.science.org/journal/sciadv\">Science Advances</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq4710vendo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?</p>\n    <p>Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.</p>\n    <p>But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week.</p>\n    <p>They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.</p>\n    <p>The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.</p>\n    <p>And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.</p>\n    <p>After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.</p>\n    <p>But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.</p>\n    <p>There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.</p>\n    <p>Now, here's the important twist.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.</p>\n    <p>But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.</p>\n    <p>The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4dca/live/eb7bf820-93d6-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far. Each year is represented by a line which tracks the numbers from January to December. 2021 saw the lowest of the five years, at 28,526 and 2022 saw the highest with 45,774. As at 8 September the total for 2025 is 30,164 which is the highest for that point in the year of any of the others.\"/>\n    <p>It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win.</p>\n    <p>But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.</p>\n    <p>That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.</p>\n    <p>If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.</p>\n    <p>So where does this decision leave the project?</p>\n    <p>This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.</p>\n    <p>Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.</p>\n    <p>But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.</p>\n    <p>The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".</p>\n    <p>Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road.</p>\n    <p>If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.</p>\n    <p>The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.</p>\n    <p>It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.</p>\n    <p>Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST).</p>\n    <p>Many Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey.

She is photographed over the shoulder of the journalist, and is wearing a black and green patterned top. \"/>\n    <p>There is no set definition of not proven in law. At the start of a criminal trial, jurors are told that there are two acquittal verdicts - but it is not explained how they differ.</p>\n    <p>Justice Secretary Angela Constance said it was a \"widely misunderstood\" verdict that \"traumatises\" victims and leaves a \"lingering stigma on the accused\".</p>\n    <p>However, the Law Society of Scotland has argued that its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice.</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-49972637\">study published in 2019</a> said removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. </p>\n    <p>It also highlighted inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty.</p>\n    <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/criminal-proceedings-scotland-2022-23/pages/6/\">Scottish government figures</a>, for 2022/23, show that 1% of people facing criminal charges in court were acquitted on a not proven verdict, compared to 4% on a not guilty verdict.</p>\n    <p>The reforms in the government's bill also include a change in how guilty verdicts are decided.</p>\n    <p>Scottish juries have 15 members and at present a simple majority of eight jurors is required for a verdict. Under the new two-thirds rule, that will be raised to 10 out of 15 jurors.</p>\n    <p>Raising the bar for guilty verdicts is intended to allay the concerns of some defence lawyers who fear the the abolition of the not proven verdict could increase the risk of wrongful convictions.</p>\n    <p>The reforms also pave the way for:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>the creation of a special sexual offences court, including \"trauma-informed\" training for judges and legal staff</li>\n      <li>a victims and witnesses commissioner - an independent office answerable to parliament that would be in charge of ensuring standards of care</li>\n      <li>a requirement for the parole board to consider if a murderer has refused to reveal the location of their victim's remains when considering if they should be freed from jail, and to take into account the safety of victims and their families</li>\n      <li>the extension of rules that restrict what can be said in court about a complainer's sexual history</li>\n      <li> a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn3n3ddlmkgo\">trial scheme</a>giving victims of rape and serious sexual assault free access to court transcripts to be made permanent</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Ministers have not set a timetable for scrapping the not proven verdict or introducing a two-thirds majority for guilty verdicts.</p>\n    <p>These changes will require judges and court staff to undergo training.</p>\n    <p>It could take significantly longer to set up a sexual offences court and a victims commissioner.</p>\n    <p>Most rape cases reported to police do not lead to prosecutions. To address this, ministers proposed a pilot scheme that would have allowed trials for serious sexual offences to be held without a jury and decided by a single judge.</p>\n    <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20n3rjp7v9o\">this measure was dropped</a> following criticism from lawyers and judges.</p>\n    <h2>'Compassion, dignity and justice'</h2>\n    <p>Victim Support Scotland chief executive Kate Wallace said the passage of the bill was a \"momentous occasion\".</p>\n    <p>\"It marks a significant step towards creating a system that considers and prioritises the needs of people impacted by crime,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Rape Crisis chief executive Sandy Brindley welcomed the removal of the not proven verdict, which she said had \"let down\" victims.</p>\n    <p>However, she also expressed \"serious concerns\" about the increase to the jury majority and \"the negative effect that this will almost certainly have on rape and sexual offence cases\".</p>\n    <p>The Law Society of Scotland said it supported the creation of a victims commissioner and the granting of automatic lifelong anonymity for victims of sexual offences.</p>\n    <p>But it warned that introducing \"untested\" changes to the justice system could raise the risk of miscarriages of justice.</p>\n    <p>Stuart Munro, convener of the society's Criminal Law Committee, said: \"Every legal system with a two-verdict system requires a unanimous or near unanimous jury to convict, whereas Scotland will now have a system where a person can be convicted despite five members of the jury having significant doubts about their guilt.\"</p>\n    <p>The bill was supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs.</p>\n    <p>Constance said the legislation would \"put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system\".</p>\n    <p>Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman told MSPs it would help deliver \"compassion, dignity and justice for victims\".</p>\n    <p>While there was broad agreement in parliament over abolishing the not proven verdict, Conservative and Labour MSPs voted against the bill.</p>\n    <p>They raised objections to pushing through such a wide range of measures in one bill and being given limited time to debate complex amendments.</p>\n    <p>Tory MSP Sharon Dowry said the legislation would \"waste millions on cosmetic solutions that will make little difference to victims\".</p>\n    <p>Labour justice spokeswoman Pauline McNeill raised concerns about taking serious sexual offence cases out of the high court and into a specialist court.</p>\n    <p>Her colleague Katy Clark added that the bill was \"far too large\" and that several amendments received too little scrutiny.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8rndyyp7vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.</p>\n    <p>At the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.</p>\n    <p>She did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\".</p>\n    <p>\"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\"</p>\n    <p>\"But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgly78j5ny8o\">Did democratic opposition in Russia die with Alexei Navalny?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68336393\">Russian opposition leader's 'principled and fearless' widow</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>She added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and \"a symbol of hope for a better future for our country\".</p>\n    <p>\"I know he was a symbol to you too,\" she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend.</p>\n    <p>\"I will not be silent. I affirm that Vladimir Putin is guilty of killing my husband, Alexei Navalny... I urge the laboratories which conducted studies to make the results public.\"</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of Navalnaya's statements.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2dbd/live/d7144120-93c3-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"@pevchikh/X A composite image of a narrow, snow-covered yard and a prison cell with a small desk, a small window covered by bars and vomit on the floor\"/>\n    <p>In the video, Navalnaya also detailed her husband's last days based on what she said was testimony by employees at the penal colony, which the BBC has not been able to verify.</p>\n    <p>According to her, on the day he died Navalny was taken out for a walk but felt ill. When he was taken back to his cell \"he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting\".</p>\n    <p>\"Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window,\" she said, citing the alleged testimonies.</p>\n    <p>An ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced \"sudden death syndrome\". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.</p>\n    <p>Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68595334\">briefly referred to him a month after his death</a> by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".</p>\n    <p>The Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia.</p>\n    <p>\"But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it,\" Putin said.</p>\n    <p>It is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death.</p>\n    <p>His popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption.</p>\n    <p>With Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule.</p>\n    <p>Many of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia. Navalnaya herself faces arrest, and she and her two children live abroad.</p>\n    <p>The crackdown on civil society ramped up further following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and punitive new laws leading to mass arrests have muzzled any opposition.</p>\n    <p>In both life and death Navalny managed to draw out huge crowds onto the streets. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68457743\">Thousands of mourners turned out for his funeral</a> in Moscow in March 2024 despite well-founded fears of a police crackdown. </p>\n    <p>No large opposition gatherings have taken place in Russia since.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ye0x28vzqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

I'm me.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm a very independent, strong-minded, effective politician in my own right.\"</p>\n    <p>She said she might have been sacked as Commons leader in Sir Keir's reshuffle for telling the Labour leadership things \"they didn't want to hear\" such as how deeply MPs opposed welfare cuts.</p>\n    <p>If she were elected deputy leader she said she would be a \"conduit\" for the views of members and tell Sir Keir \"when we're getting things wrong\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to the Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, she said she did not want a cabinet job if she succeeded, adding that Sir Keir had been \"really clear\" that David Lammy would be Rayner's replacement as deputy PM.</p>\n    <p>As a \"full-time deputy leader\", she said she would aim to bridge the gap between party members and the leadership.</p>\n    <p>Launching her bid for the deputy leadership, Phillipson urged Labour to remain united to win a second term in government.</p>\n    <p>\"I won't pretend this government hasn't made mistakes – I've been first to admit it\" she told supporters in her Sunderland constituency.</p>\n    <p>\"But we can't afford to look inwards - to go back to bad old days of divided Labour Party and open old wounds.</p>\n    <p>\"If we turn against each other only one person will win – [Reform UK leader] Nigel Farage - but millions more will lose.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>You can hear the full interview with Lucy Powell on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson </strong>\n      <strong>on BBC Sounds</strong>\n      <strong>.

So, we'll talk to them.\"</p>\n    <p>His comments will be welcomed by Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, who said that tariff relief for British steel is being negotiated.</p>\n    <p>Senior government sources insist there \"remains a path to zero\".</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is \"no mere pageant\" and warned the government that \"we can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past\".</p>\n    <p>An agreement to reduce the tariffs to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July.</p>\n    <p>At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as \"devastating\".</p>\n    <p>However, industry sources told the BBC on Tuesday that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%.</p>\n    <p>One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry.</p>\n    <p>One UK steel producer told the BBC they were \"furious\" about the situation.</p>\n    <p>The company, which has US customers and saw opportunities to increase exports to the country, said it would now struggle to compete with a price advantage over American steel producers.</p>\n    <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.\"</p>\n    <p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UK's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027.</p>\n    <p>The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress.

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.</p>\n    <p>The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.</p>\n    <p>In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was \"an interim judgement on one individual\" which would not halt the deal.</p>\n    <p>\"It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,\" Kendall said.</p>\n    <p>She said ministers never claimed the deal would be \"a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems\" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.</p>\n    <p>Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.</p>\n    <p>\"There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.\"</p>\n    <p>The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.</p>\n    <p>But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had \"very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals\".</p>\n    <p>Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.</p>\n    <p>Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be \"quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats\".</p>\n    <p>She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was \"worth it to have due process and a fair system\".</p>\n    <p>\"It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],\" Townley said.</p>\n    <p>She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an \"overarching problem\" with the scheme's design.</p>\n    <p>Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with \"we told you so\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for \"some tough laws\" and said \"we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country\".</p>\n    <p>Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as \"one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel\".</p>\n    <p>Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.</p>\n    <p>A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.</p>\n    <p>More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.</p>\n    <p>It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea8/live/2959ad80-9338-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far.

its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,\" Mr Huang told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but \"what's missing is the AI infrastructure,\" adding: \"We are here to build it.\"</p>\n    <p>AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of \"building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally.\"</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity.</p>\n    <p>\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,\" he told the BBC.</p>\n    <p>\"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs \"putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom\".</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p>But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst.</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be \"over-hyped or under-hyped\".</p>\n    <p>He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\".</p>\n    <p>He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.</p>\n    <p>The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".</p>\n    <p>The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g3dr4n4no\">already announced</a> by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.</p>\n    <h2>Big tech comes to town</h2>\n    <p>Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.</p>\n    <p>The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.</p>\n    <p>Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.</p>\n    <p>The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1ld568v5j4o\">said to be part of trade discussions</a>.</p>\n    <p>But Ms Kendall told the Today programme \"that wasn't part of the partnership\" now agreed.</p>\n    <p>She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e6z590wweo\">major issue for the UK's creative sector</a> - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.</p>\n    <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmek723dz9o\">promised £5bn</a> for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.</p>\n    <p>Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9jyzl4532o\">accompany Trump to a state banquet</a> hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.</p>\n    <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England</h2>\n    <p>The government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r01y04kz9o\">AI growth zone</a>\".</p>\n    <p>It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland -

It also noted that “inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.”</p>\n    <p>This is a change from the board’s last meeting in July, when it said that labor market conditions “remain solid”. And this is the first time the board has said inflation is going up.</p>\n    <p>The statement also noted that Stephen Miran, Trump’s appointee to the board who was confirmed on Monday, was the only member of the board to vote against the rate cut. Miran wanted to lower rates by a half-point, instead of a quarter-point.</p>\n    <p>Inflation rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of tariffs on to consumers.</p>\n    <p>The newest update to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.</p>\n    <p>Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the US jobs market is weakening.</p>\n    <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.</p>\n    <p>The Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated last month that the central bank was gearing up to cut interest rates for the first time this year.</p>\n    <p>For months, policymakers defied public calls from Trump to lower rates – and brushed off his increasingly aggressive criticism of the Fed’s decision to hold them steady.</p>\n    <p>“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized speech at the Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, highlighting a “challenging” dichotomy of risks: that Trump’s tariffs might increase inflation, while his immigration policies knock the US labor market.</p>\n    <p>Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that the labor market has stalled while inflation picked up, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully in the months ahead.</p>\n    <p>Trump has already suggested that he will be unhappy with the modest cut the Fed is widely expected to unveil later. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform early on Monday, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration’s extraordinary bid to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed by Biden, and remove her from the central bank’s board before this meeting, has so far failed.</p>\n    <p>Late on Monday, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s request to block Cook from attending the Fed’s latest rate-setting session, which started yesterday.</p>\n    <p>The president cited unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud as he attempted to fire Cook, who has denied wrongdoing and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038.</p>\n    <p>No president has pursued such action – and moved to dismiss a governor at the Fed, which has long been independent from political interference – since the central bank’s founding in 1913.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his hopes to increase his oversight of the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration raced to strengthen its influence over the Fed ahead of this week’s meeting.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Miran, a senior official who served as chair of the White House council of economic advisers, was confirmed by Senate Republicans as a Fed governor on Monday evening, and formally sworn in on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>His appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch will also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates amid Trump pressure</p>\n    <p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce the first interest rate cut since December as a two-day policy meeting nears its end.</p>\n    <p>The Fed started the meeting on Tuesday, hours after Donald Trump’s new appointee narrowly won confirmation to join the central bank – while Fed governor Lisa Cook continues to fight her removal by the president.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Miran, the chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, took the oath of office as a Fed governor early on Tuesday after narrowly winning a Senate confirmation vote along party lines on Monday night.</p>\n    <p>There is little doubt that the Fed will make its first interest rate cut of 2025 after the latest gathering, as policymakers pivot towards shoring up a deteriorating jobs market.</p>\n    <p>But concerns about political influence targeting the independent central bank looms over the gathering, as Trump repeatedly bashes Fed Chair Jerome Powell over his rate decisions, and after he moved to fire governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle.</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the Fed should “listen to smart people like me.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\">confirmed</a> Miran on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting.”</p>\n    <p>The dilemma for the Fed is that lowering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates\">interest rates</a> will make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.</p>\n    <p>Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.</p>\n    <p>The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.</p>\n    <p>Such risks seemed to materialize when federal jobs data for May and June showed the number of jobs added to the economy was revised down by 258,000. Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">Trump’s tariffs</a> have caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025\">estimates</a> that tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?</p>\n    <p>The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\">stagflation</a>”.</p>\n    <p>For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-trade-inflation-tariffs-cbo.html\">told</a> CNBC Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.</p>\n    <p>Wednesday’s rate cut comes at a tense political moment for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> after Trump’s months-long campaign to get the central bank to cut rates.

Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw wide-ranging, and often unpopular, changes at a club he claimed in March had “gone one off the rails” as a business. The British billionaire warned United would have gone “bust at Christmas” if they had not taken “really tough decisions”.</p>\n<p>The chief executive, Omar Berrada, said:</p>\n<p>On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.</p>\n<p>To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United … As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.</p>\n<p>Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by quarter point</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Whether it’s a favourite bar, biscuit or indulgent hot drink, feeding a chocolate habit costs more than it used to.</p>\n    <p>The price of the chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot.</p>\n    <p>Although other price moves meant overall UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\">was unchanged at 3.8%</a> last month, chocolate was a big riser. Alongside hikes for beef, butter and coffee, it helped propel food price inflation back over 5% for the first time in 18 months.</p>\n    <p>At £30 a go, the luxury 1kg jars of giant chocolate buttons sold by gifting brand Cocoba were a casualty of a soaring cocoa price, explains the company’s founder Darren Litton.</p>\n    <p>With cocoa prices more than doubling over the past two years as a result of poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, even something aimed at gift buyers was being priced off the shelf.</p>\n    <p>“We delisted them for a while because we couldn’t even sell them at £40 with the price of everything involved,” Litton says.</p>\n    <p>Cocoa now commands about $7,800 (£5,700) per tonne on international commodities markets from below $3,500 (£2,600) two years ago. The price peaked at more than $12,000 (£8,800) at the end of 2024.</p>\n    <p>The easing price means Cocoba is bringing the jars of giant buttons back for Christmas, but even at £40 Litton says it’s a challenge to make the numbers add up.</p>\n    <p>“The cocoa price is still at a very, very high level but seems to be settling down a bit,” he adds. “We make everything at our factory in Kent. We’ve had to increase prices and invest in equipment to improve efficiency.”</p>\n    <p>Cocoba is a minnow in a market dominated by big names such as Nestlé and Mars but surging ingredient costs have hurt them too. Mondelēz, which owns Cadbury, expects annual profits to fall 10% owing to higher cocoa prices.</p>\n    <p>The squeeze has triggered numerous rounds of shrinkflation, with the Guardian recently revealing that tubs of Quality Street and Celebrations and even some Toblerone bars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/shrinkflation-bites-as-boxes-of-quality-street-and-celebrations-lose-weight\">have shrunk</a> ahead of Christmas.</p>\n    <p>Not much gets past cash-strapped shoppers, who have also raised eyebrows on discovering a KitKat nine-pack is now an eight-pack, and a multipack of Freddos contains four not five chocolates.</p>\n    <p>Alex Lawrence, a retail expert at data company Circana, says higher ingredient costs are being passed on to the consumer. “If you look at the average price per kg for chocolate confectionery it’s up 27% over the last two years, and 12% in the last year.”</p>\n    <p>Britons spent £5.9bn on chocolate in stores in the year to 9 August. Although that figure was up 10%, they actually physically took home less in their baskets.</p>\n    <p>“The quantity we are buying is down 2% year-on-year,” says Lawrence. “People are definitely pulling back in terms of their consumption.”</p>\n    <p>Shop price data compiled for the Guardian reveals the extent of increases over the past two years, with favourites such as Cadbury Dairy Milk or Galaxy costing about 30% more than in 2023.</p>\n    <p>A 110g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk now costs £1.84 on average, which works out at 42p more than in 2023, according to the price analysts Assosia. The equivalent Galaxy bar has gone up by the same amount to £1.79. The data is based on the average pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.</p>\n    <p>The big companies all say the same thing when asked about pack size reductions and price increases. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Mondelēz told the Guardian it continued to experience “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they had done previously.</p>\n    <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p>\n    <p>On the high street, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk\">upmarket Knoops chain</a> sells posh hot chocolates graded by cocoa percentage, with prices starting at £4 for a drink made with a 28% single-origin Colombian chocolate.</p>\n    <p>“It’s been a wild ride for cocoa prices,” says company founder Jens Knoop. It is not just cocoa, he adds that the chain’s matcha bill increased 53% this month.</p>\n    <p>“While there have been increases in our per kilo chocolate price … we have only passed on a small percentage of that to our customers in their chocolate drinks,” says Knoop.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>But while you might treat yourself to Knoops’ most expensive brew – a limited edition 68% single-origin Madagascan chocolate costing £7.90 – on a day out, in the supermarket consumers balk at tubs of instant hot chocolate costing north of a fiver.</p>\n    <p>The price of a 220g jar of Options is up 20% over two years at £5.40, according to Assosia, prompting shoppers to take to supermarket websites to complain. “This is a good product,” writes one. “It used to be reasonably priced £3-£4 Now it is £5.40!!!!”</p>\n    <p>In a similar vein, at £4.50 a 500g tub of Cadbury hot chocolate costs a fifth more than it did in 2023.</p>\n    <p>Shoppers also complain that other price changes take the biscuit. At £2.25, a 266g pack of McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives costs 35p more than two years ago. Meanwhile a 130g pack of Fox’s milk chocolatey rounds is now £2.30. The same pack cost £1.87 two years ago.</p>\n    <p>The increases are also notable on supermarket own-label chocolate digestives – which provide a cheaper alternative to the big brands – with a 300g pack now £1.12, up from 85p two years ago.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink inflation could hit 5.7% by the end of year, up from August’s reading of 5.1%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food\">Food</a> and Drink Federation.</p>\n    <p>Karen Betts, the trade body’s chief executive, says rising food prices were previously down to energy and commodity shocks, but now government policies – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/reeves-defends-40bn-tax-increase-in-autumn-budget-as-businesses-prepare-for-nics-hike\">April’s increase in employers’ national insurance contributions</a> – were a driver.</p>\n    <p>“The costs are such that companies can no longer absorb them and are having to pass at least some of them on to consumers.”</p>\n    <p>Needless to say it’s a difficult environment for small companies such as Temprd, which makes “properly chunky” chocolate bars, in flavours such as lemon and blueberry cheesecake.</p>\n    <p>When Rob Anthony started the Essex company with his brother five years ago he was aware that its premium bars looked expensive compared to “run of the mill” chocolate. “At that time our bars were probably around £3 per 100g. Now they are £4.50.</p>\n    <p>“We had to make two jumps, from £3 to £3.75 and then to £4.50, so two price rises in the last four years,” he says, but is hopeful the worst is over.</p>\n    <p>“There might be a [cocoa] surplus this year, because demand has fallen, and production has been quite good. We’re fairly confident we can survive through from now to next Easter without having to put our prices up.”</p>\n    <p>As the brands sold in supermarkets become more expensive Anthony suggests people are becoming more circumspect.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t changed the recipe,” he says. “We haven’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">skimpflated</a> our product or changed the size. We just put the price up to cope with price increases. People are willing to spend more less often to buy a luxury product … they feel they’re getting better value for money.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/chocolate-inflation-consumers-spend-more-but-get-less-prices-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The cost of air fares was the main downward driver, while prices rose for petrol and diesel. The cost of hotel accommodation also fell by less than this time last year.</p>\n    <p>Food price inflation climbed for a fifth consecutive month, up from 4.9% in July to 5.1% in August, with small increases in a range of vegetables, cheese and fish items. The price of chocolate rose by 15.4%, while the cost of beef, butter and coffee also increased sharply.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">facing intense scrutiny over Labour’s economic management</a> amid widespread speculation about tax increases in her autumn budget, which is expected on 26 November.</p>\n    <p>Business groups said the chancellor’s 2024 autumn budget measures, including the £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a>, would force them to cut jobs and raise prices.</p>\n    <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “With borrowing costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">hitting a 27-year high</a>, working people and businesses are bracing for even more tax rises to pay for Labour’s mismanagement.”</p>\n    <p>Reeves said the government was taking action to help households. “I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.”</p>\n    <p>The Bank forecasts inflation is on track to peak at 4%, with the potential to delay further interest rate cuts. Threadneedle Street has cut borrowing costs five times since summer 2024.</p>\n    <p>City economists said there were some signs that inflationary pressures were beginning to abate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> for consumer services, which is closely watched by the Bank, slowed to 4.7% from 5% in July. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food and tobacco prices, fell to 3.6% from 3.8%.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Inflation has come down from a peak of 11.1% in the second half of 2022, the highest rate in four decades, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuelled an increase in the price of energy and food.</p>\n    <p>Although the headline rate has fallen back, households have come under renewed pressure after a rise in taxes and regulated utility prices in April, including for energy and water. Threadneedle Street has also expressed concern over fast-rising food prices, which hit lower-income households hardest.</p>\n    <p>Economists say that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/28/climateflation-could-push-up-uk-food-prices-by-more-than-a-third-by-2050-report-says\">extreme weather conditions are pushing up food prices</a>, as the climate emergency causes more droughts and floods, affecting harvests around the world. UK food manufacturers and retailers said government regulations and taxes were also having an effect.</p>\n    <p>Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, urged the Bank to cut rates to ease pressure on workers, arguing that high borrowing costs would have little impact on price increases due to global challenges.</p>\n    <p>“Keeping interest rates high will not bring down these prices – but instead, rates are adding to the pain for families and businesses,” the TUC boss said.</p>\n    <p>Official figures on Tuesday showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">the jobs market cooled in July</a>, while economic growth remains weak, adding to pressure on the Bank to consider a cut in rates. The ONS will provide updated figures for retail sales and the government finances on Friday. However, analysts said concerns remained over stubborn inflation.</p>\n    <p>Martin Sartorius, the principal economist at the CBI business lobby group, said: “The monetary policy committee [MPC] looks set to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow and, going forward, the MPC faces a delicate balance between signs of a cooling labour market and the risk of price pressures remaining stubbornly high.”</p>\n    <p>UK inflation is running at the highest rate in the G7, outpacing a 2.9% headline rate in the US. The rate is also significantly above the eurozone’s 2.1%, and flash estimates for France (0.8%) and Germany (2.1%), for August.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p>\n    <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p>\n    <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p>\n    <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p>\n    <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p>\n    <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p>\n    <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p>\n    <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p>\n    <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/labour-growth-far-right-economy-andy-haldane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

Now, in <i>Replaceable You: Adventures in Human Anatomy</i>, she chronicles both the history of body part replacement (including prosthetic noses that date back to the 1500s), as well as more recent medical breakthroughs.</p>\n    <p>The book was inspired by a woman Roach knows with spina bifida, whose gait was impeded by a twisted foot.

What happened in the '40s, '50s, '60s, there was a project, it was a collaboration between the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Foundation, which was the research arm of the Mayo clinic, and the Hormel Institute, which was the research arm of pork. The goal here was to create a smaller pig, a pig that would be a good match in terms of not just the size of human organs, but the functions. There were all these studies were done looking at do pigs get coronary artery disease? And it turns out they do. In fact, the pig was described in one of their papers as a caricature of an obese human. In other words, gets heart disease, has heart issues, doesn't get enough exercise. …</p>\n    <p>If you are going to use the pig as your model, as your stand-in for a human, then you want to be sure that these organs ... behave similarly, that they have a similar size. So this research, once it got rolling, and there were dozens and dozens of papers, three volumes of papers looking at kidney function, liver function. There was one on orthodontia where they had put braces onto pigs. So it was all toward the goal of creating an analog, a stand-in for a human being for trying out surgical techniques or not so much pharmaceuticals, but techniques and replacements. So the pig became the go-to creature. … I mean who knows, a goat might've been equally useful, but nobody started using goats.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On preventing the body from rejecting a pig organ </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>With an organ that's coming from another species, the reaction is quite severe. It's called a hyperacute rejection, where, within minutes, the body starts to attack, the organ starts to turn black. You don't want to put a pig organ into somebody without it having been genetically edited. So one of the things that's edited is something called the alpha-gal protein. And this is a surface protein that the body, if you can knock that out, you're basically just making the pig organ seem a little less pig-like and a little more human-like. So now you're dealing with a level of rejection that you would get with a human transplant. In other words, taking some other human's organ and transplanting it. So the person is still on an immunosuppressive regimen, taking drugs to suppress the immune system. But on about the same level as they would with a human.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On if a pig transplant is kosher </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I asked the surgeon who was involved in the first pig transplant … and he said, yeah, there are a lot of folks both in the Jewish religion and the Muslim religion who really wish we'd chosen a different species, because I had been asking him, why pigs? And he says, I get that question all the time. The thing is, he said, we're not eating them, we are saving lives. So it's OK to get a pig organ if you're keeping kosher. ... There were interviews with various religious thought leaders and there was consensus that it is indeed OK to have a pig organ implanted. Just don't eat it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiments 3D printing muscle and tissue </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I spent a day at the Feinberg lab at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, and what people were working on there was trying to print muscle in a way that the alignment of the cells would create muscle that had the specific function that muscle needed. In other words, a heart, the heart needs to move in a kind of a twisting motion. It twists as it pumps, so you've got to print the cells. They have to be in a helix shape, which is different from, say, the hamstring, where it'd be kind of parallel. Or the shoulder muscle, they're in a fan-like shape, which gives you a lot of the versatility of the movement of the shoulder. So you're not just printing generic muscle. You have to print it in a very specific way to achieve the function that you want it to be doing, which I found kind of amazing. No one is printing whole organs. That's way off in the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the tediousness of tissue recovery for organ donations </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I arrived in the room where they were doing the tissue recovery, where they would be extracting the bone and the tendon and the skin, etc., one of the people doing it said to me, this is the worst part of the job. And I kind of assumed I had preconceived notions of what the worst of that job might be, but she was talking about handwriting on labels the same ID number over and over, double checking, cross checking, the amount of paperwork and labeling, and then at the end, packing and shipping was the tedious and unpleasant part of her job, not the opening up of a leg and the extracting of bone or ligament. I guess I just wasn't expecting that.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On how knowing too much about how our bodies work can get in your head</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I wrote <i>Gulp ...</i> I became really aware of what's going on in your mouth when you chew, the process of bolus formation, where you're taking a piece of meat, say, and you're breaking it down and then you're putting it back together in a bolus that's a shape that can slide down the throat. And I visited somebody who studies chewing and this process and what the jaws do, and I remember for a while after that going to restaurants and thinking, looking around at people chewing and swallowing and thinking this is disgusting. People should have sex in public and eat in private! It's absolutely disgusting.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Here, though, Chidgey imagines an outcome in which a treaty leaves no clear victor, and in which the U.K. carries on with the caveat that Nazi crimes have become useful scientific precedent.

If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy.\"</p>\n    <p>But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: \"AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them.</p>\n    <p>\"Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines,\" she said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmek723dz9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

We were aware of it before the summer, but the last two weeks have made it more difficult,\" is how one senior figure put it.</p>\n    <p>Another senior figure tells me Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party Conference in a fortnight's time \"will leave people in absolutely no doubt at all what he stands for and what the government stands for\".</p>\n    <p>That, in itself, is a tacit acknowledgement that from No10's point of view nowhere near enough people could say what he stands for now.</p>\n    <p>The argument we are likely to hear is being rehearsed already: the prime minister told Channel 4 News that he has every intention of sticking around as Labour's leader, and made the case for why:</p>\n    <p>\"I am absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour Party and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.\"</p>\n    <p>What, then, of Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party?</p>\n    <p>My phone rings and it is a former Conservative cabinet minister on the other end.</p>\n    <p>They say it is \"another unsurprising exit\" and describe Kruger as \"impossible\" and an \"ideologue\".</p>\n    <p>But when I bump into another former Conservative cabinet minister they are more pensive at what they fear the defection says about the Tories.</p>\n    <p>As the Conservatives also approach their annual conference, they confront a moment of peril greater than any in their modern history.</p>\n    <p>And then there is Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>Make no mistake, they face colossal questions:</p>\n    <p>Just for a start, can they build the campaigning infrastructure, the local parties, the list of vetted candidates, the policy heft and attract the talent to present themselves as a viable alternative government?</p>\n    <p>Then there is the cranking up of scrutiny they will now face, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce845w70g0yo\">such as this story from the BBC's Billy Kenber and Phil Kemp</a>.</p>\n    <p>They are taking on all of this and a lot more in the blink of an eye and it is far from certain it is do-able.</p>\n    <p>But with each passing month, their opponents treat with increasing credibility the possibility it could happen.</p>\n    <p>What we are witnessing, so often, in other parties right now is their reaction to that.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2ejlpdjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

She is smiling wearing a black t-shirt with the polished wooden floor and a large mirror of the studio in soft focus in the background.\"/>\n    <p>At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.</p>\n    <p>Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo\">a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April</a>, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.</p>\n    <p>Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home.</p>\n    <p>\"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"</p>\n    <p>Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.</p>\n    <p>The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.</p>\n    <p>Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.</p>\n    <p>The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet.</p>\n    <p>The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.</p>\n    <p>It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.</p>\n    <p>That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.</p>\n    <p>\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.</p>\n    <p>Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending.</p>\n    <p>And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head. She is wearing a black t-shirt and is standng in a dance studio. In the background there is a window with curtains on the left and a white door at the back.\"/>\n    <p>Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now.</p>\n    <p>That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.</p>\n    <p>As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.</p>\n    <p>The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".</p>\n    <p>So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation.</p>\n    <p>Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that.</p>\n    <p>Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.</p>\n    <p>The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4gnk7g228o\">the row over the winter fuel payment</a>, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.</p>\n    <p>That is not just the case with current retirees.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.</p>\n    <p>Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.</p>\n    <p>There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.</p>\n    <p>No-one said getting older was easy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

Official buildings, residences of political leaders and luxury hotels such as the Hilton, which opened in July 2024, were torched, vandalised and looted. The wife of a former prime minister is fighting for her life after their home was set ablaze.</p>\n    <p>The protests represented \"a wholesale rejection of Nepal's current political class for decades of poor governance and exploitation of state resources\", said Ashish Pradhan, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. But the damage to government services, he added, could \"parallel the toll of the 2015 earthquake which took almost 9,000 lives\".</p>\n    <p>The destruction is not only confined to the capital Kathmandu - at least 300 local government offices across the nation have been damaged.</p>\n    <p>The financial losses could amount to 3 trillion Nepalese rupees ($21.3bn; £15.6bn), nearly half of the country's GDP, according to the Kathmandu Post. Its offices were also attacked by crowds and set on fire.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4b8/live/4406fbb0-9315-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"Instagram / sgtthb Saugat Thapa, in a red sweater and black trousers, stands next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands \"/>\n    <h2>'Nepo babies'</h2>\n    <p>Two days before the deadly demonstration on 8 September, Ms Pandey, a 24-year-old environmental campaigner, uploaded a video showing a mining site in Chure, one of the most fragile mountain ranges in the region. Nepal's resources should belong to the people, not to \"politicians' private limited companies\", she wrote, calling on her peers to \"march against corruption and the misuse of our nation's wealth\".</p>\n    <p>Like many youth movements in Asia, Nepal's Gen Z protests were leaderless. Others had made similar pleas to Ms Pandey's after the Nepali government decided to ban 26 social media platforms, citing their failure to register locally.</p>\n    <p>For months, fury had been brewing against \"nepo babies\", the children of powerful politicians of all stripes, who were accused of flaunting their unexplained wealth on social media.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DEDKrLfyZ_3/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">One of the most viral photos showed Saugat Thapa</a>, the son of a provincial minister, standing next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. In response, he said it was \"an unfair misinterpretation\" and his father \"returned every rupee earned from public service to the community\".</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey had watched almost all \"nepo babies\" content, but one video juxtaposing the luxurious life of a political family and an ordinary young Nepali who had to find work in a Gulf country struck her.</p>\n    <p>\"It is painful to watch, especially knowing that even educated youth are forced to leave the country because wages here are far below what one needs to live with dignity,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Nepal is a young democracy. It became a republic in 2008, after a decade-long, Maoist-led civil war that killed more than 17,000 people.</p>\n    <p>But the promised stability and prosperity have not materialised. In 17 years, Nepal has had 14 governments, and no leader has completed a full five-year term. The country's politics resemble a game of musical chairs, with communist parties and the centrist Nepali Congress taking turns to rule. Three leaders, including KP Sharma Oli who resigned over the Gen Z protests, returned to power multiple times.</p>\n    <p>Nepal's GDP per capita remained under $1,500, making it the second-poorest country in South Asia, behind only Afghanistan. An estimated 14% of the population work overseas, and one in three households receives remittances.</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey comes from a middle-class family in eastern Nepal and her father is a retired government teacher. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which she is still receiving treatment. The medical bills nearly bankrupted her family, so her older sister moved to Australia to support them.</p>\n    <p>Before the protests, Ms Pandey worked with others to create guidelines stressing non-violence and respect and reminding participants to stay vigilant against \"hijackers\".</p>\n    <p>On the morning of 8 September, she arrived at Maitighar Mandala, a huge traffic island in central Kathmandu with several of her friends. She was expecting thousands would turn up at most – but the crowds kept swelling.</p>\n    <p>Aakriti Ghimire, a 26-year-old protester, said things were initially peaceful and communal. \"We were all seated, we were singing old Nepali songs,\" she said. \"The slogans and everything were so funny, we were enjoying it. And after that, we started to march… the police were there to ensure that there were no vehicles disturbing us.\"</p>\n    <p>Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire started to sense danger at around midday, when crowds began moving to New Baneshwor, the neighbourhood housing parliament. Both saw people arriving on motorbikes, and Ms Pandey said these people appeared older than average Gen Z protesters.</p>\n    <p>Ms Ghimire believes they were infiltrators. \"It became very tricky for us to distinguish the peaceful protesters – some people who genuinely came for something – versus those who came in with the intention of being violent.\"</p>\n    <p>When some protesters tried to breach the security around parliament, police fired tear gas, water cannon and shots in return. There is evidence live rounds were used and they are accused of shooting at schoolchildren as well. An investigation into what happened is under way.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ede5/live/c6036440-9316-11f0-be26-dfb5c8eb987f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Smoke rises from the burnt Hilton Kathmandu hotel, following protests against Monday's killing of 19 people after anti-corruption protests triggered by a social media ban \"/>\n    <p>Chaos and violence reigned the next day. Demonstrators retaliated by setting parliament, the prime minister's office and other government buildings ablaze. Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire stayed indoors and watched the developments online.</p>\n    <p>\"A lot of people did share that it felt so good to finally see politicians face the consequences of everything they've done,\" Ms Ghimire said, referring to the destruction of the leaders' homes. But the mood soon darkened.</p>\n    <p>\"I saw people with bottles filled with petroleum. They got it from the motorbikes. They started attacking the parliament,\" said Ms Pandey.</p>\n    <p>The law graduate cried after seeing the Supreme Court on fire, saying that it was like \"a temple\" for her. Her friends at the scene were pouring water on the flames to try to put them out. They all knew the effort would be futile – they did it only to console themselves.</p>\n    <p>\"People say the arsonists intended to come and burn these things… Who are these people?\" asked Ms Ghimire. \"The videos show these people are all masked.\"</p>\n    <p>Some calm was restored when the army was deployed to take control of the situation - a curfew was in place for days. Later in the week <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c179qne0zw0o\">former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister</a>. She had been backed by protesters for the post. </p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey hopes she \"can lead the country efficiently, do the election in stipulated time and hand the power to the people\".</p>\n    <p>But the anxiety about Nepal's political future persists.</p>\n    <p>Rumela Sen, a South Asia expert at Columbia University, said it was \"worrying\" to see \"an unprecedented glorification of the army as a voice of sanity and stability\".</p>\n    <p>Many are also uncomfortable with the involvement of Durga Prasai in the initial negotiation at the invitation of the military. Mr Prasai was arrested for his role in violent pro-monarchy protests in March. He fled to India but was returned to Nepal. The Gen Z protesters walked out of the talks over his involvement.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8dec/live/35d5bb80-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters People take part in a candlelight vigil in memory of people who died during the protest against anti-corruption triggered by a social media ban \"/>\n    <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zkmxlkm9o\">families of protesters who were killed are reckoning with their deaths</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"We are deeply shocked because we have lost our beloved son,\" said Yubaraj Neupane, whose 23-year-old son Yogendra died in the protests. \"I am yet to find out how he died.\"</p>\n    <p>Yogendra was shot in the back of the head near the parliament building, according to the post mortem report.</p>\n    <p>From south-eastern Nepal, the family's eldest son had pursued his studies in Kathmandu and aspired to be a civil servant. He was always studying, friends and relatives said.</p>\n    <p>But on 8 September, he joined the protests with his friends, dreaming of bringing change to the country. His family didn't know he was at the scene until he called them after the situation started heating up.</p>\n    <p>\"Our beloved has lost his life calling for change,\" his great-uncle Saubhagya said. \"His blood and sacrifice should be recognised so that other young people won't have to hit the streets again in the future.\"</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey said she was cautiously optimistic about her country's future, but the trauma of the past week would stay with her for the rest of her life.</p>\n    <p>This is a political awakening for her generation.</p>\n    <p>\"We are no longer willing to stay silent or accept injustice,\" she says. \"This is not just a gentle nudge; it's a bold challenge to a system that has hoarded power for decades.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Additional reporting by Grace Tsoi</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

He is wearing a blue tie and black suit and sits on a red sofa in front of a blue backdrop.\"/>\n    <p>A police investigation into claims former Conservative MP Mark Menzies misused donors' money to pay \"bad people\" has been dropped after he agreed to repay the money.</p>\n    <p>Police opened an investigation into Menzies last year after accusations the then-MP for Fylde had used campaign funds for personal expenses.</p>\n    <p>BBC News understands that at least some of that money was used to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <p>It was reported by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/tory-mp-mark-menzies-under-investigation-campaign-funds-bhksggpwl\">The Times newspaper</a> that Menzies had telephoned an elderly Conservative party volunteer at 3am in December 2023, to say he had been locked in a flat by \"bad people\" and needed thousands of pounds immediately.</p>\n    <p>He made other calls that morning and eventually borrowed a total of around £8,500 from his office manager and another aide.</p>\n    <p>The majority of that - some £6,500 - was repaid from a bank account set up for money raised from local political supporters.</p>\n    <p>Questions were also raised about a further £14,000 in donor funds which Menzies had used for what he described as medical expenses, according to a party volunteer who was a signatory on the bank account.</p>\n    <p>Menzies, who did not respond to a request for comment, stood down at the last general election but has continued to face two investigations from the police and expenses watchdog into his conduct.</p>\n    <p>Both have now concluded they will not take action against him.</p>\n    <p>The police investigation followed Labour demanding a probe into potential fraud and misconduct in public office offences and officers spent months interviewing several people with knowledge of Menzies's spending.</p>\n    <p>A spokesman for Lancashire police said that a \"full and thorough investigation\" had found \"no evidence that any criminal offences have taken place\".</p>\n    <p>Two people interviewed as part of the police investigation said they had been told by officers that it was dropped in part because Menzies had agreed to repay borrowed money.</p>\n    <p>It is not clear how much he has agreed to pay, but he repaid £1,000 into the bank account containing donors' money in June.</p>\n    <p>Katie Fieldhouse, the life-long Conservative supporter who had received the late night phone call from Menzies, said she was recently contacted by Lancashire police with an update.</p>\n    <p>\"The police rang me. They told me there's insufficient evidence to prosecute and he's agreed to pay it back,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Another source involved with the business account said they also understood the ex-MP's agreement to repay funds to be part of the reason the police had closed the investigation.</p>\n    <p>Menzies is not thought to have found employment since he stood down as an MP but the Conservative party confirmed they had given him a hardship loan which is understood to be a five-figure sum.</p>\n    <p>He was first elected in 2010. He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.</p>\n    <p>The money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.</p>\n    <p>In December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.</p>\n    <p>He claimed it was \"a matter of life and death\", she has said, with men holding him in a London flat and refusing to release him unless he paid up.</p>\n    <p>The former MP subsequently denied the men in the flat he labelled \"bad people\" were sex workers.</p>\n    <p>A source close to him instead told The Times that he'd met a man on an online dating website, subsequently gone to the flat of a second man,<strong> </strong>and then been falsely accused of being sick before facing demands for a large sum to pay for cleaning.</p>\n    <p>However, one of the men present at the flat has admitted they had agreed to have sex with Menzies for payment.</p>\n    <p>The man, who is Brazilian, advertises himself as a \"high-class male escort\" and said he had participated in a \"party\" with Menzies and several other escorts.</p>\n    <p>The gathering lasted from Wednesday night to Friday morning, with Menzies absent from a full day of parliamentary work.</p>\n    <p>At its conclusion, Menzies didn't have sufficient funds to pay his bill, which amounted to more than £14,000, according to an account he later gave a close aide.</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian man denied that Menzies had ever been locked in but said there were \"lots of other guys\" and the then-MP \"hadn't paid anyone\".</p>\n    <p>He said he was not aware that Menzies was a politician and when informed of this added that he was \"surprised [b]ut that's his problem, I have nothing to do with it\".</p>\n    <p>\"My contact with him was just for work and ended there,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>As well as telephoning Ms Fieldhouse to demand money from the campaign funds account, Menzies summoned a male aide in his 30s to travel from Manchester to London to meet him at the flat where the \"party\" had taken place.</p>\n    <p>The aide said he was also asked for money, and he and a family member ended up handing over around £1,500.</p>\n    <p>Menzies received a further £6,500 from his office manager. She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.</p>\n    <p>After meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.</p>\n    <p>The aide said that Menzies's office manager gave him £1,000 from the money she had been reimbursed from the local business group's account, but he was still owed £500 which the MP told him he couldn't afford to pay.</p>\n    <p>He alleged that Menzies instead told him he would arrange for a bonus payment to be made through his parliamentary staffing budget.</p>\n    <p>Ipsa, which investigated this claim as an allegation of fraud, found that Menzies had signed off a bonus payment for the aide \"a few days after the incident in question\". This was the only time the aide received a bonus and was described as being for work he had done on a wind farm application.</p>\n    <p>The bonus was for £700, amounting to around £500 after tax.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/w59ykwiqehvh/3YnHUeKx52oK5dWRUMHMqO/e318efae337c17e4a3abb339f7a10826/Closure_report_MM.pdf\">In a report on its investigation published on Tuesday</a>, Ipsa's compliance officer said that he had found the case \"not proven\".</p>\n    <p>He wrote that there was \"evidence of wrongdoing\", including the timing of the payment, but stated that the aide was \"non-committal\" in his statement to the police on whether it was for wind farm work or to reimburse him, and that there was a discrepancy over the amount because he'd claimed to be owed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>Another of Menzies's former staffers also told Ipsa the payment was legitimately for the aide's wind farm work.</p>\n    <p>The aide told the BBC that he had done work on a wind farm, but that was just the excuse Menzies used for the bonus which he told him was actually to reimburse him for the money he had lent him to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They are both smiling.\"/>\n    <p>More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on<strong> </strong>the government's approach to tackling addiction.</p>\n    <p>Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.</p>\n    <p>The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to correct data and it is understood ministers are now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.</p>\n    <p>A former senior civil servant said fewer people might have died if drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.</p>\n    <p>Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.</p>\n    <p>The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.</p>\n    <p>Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.</p>\n    <p>Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.</p>\n    <p>The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.</p>\n    <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the most senior civil servant at the Home Office between 2017 and 2020, told the BBC it was \"quite possible\" that fewer people would have died, if the government's drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It really does matter, first of all the level of attention given to these issues, but then specifically it will affect decisions on how much funding to put into health-related programmes, treatment programmes, or into different bits of the criminal justice system.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.</p>\n    <p>His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

That's why the Welsh health service is performing so badly.</p>\n    <p>\"Liberal Democrats are literally the only party coming with solutions for social care in Wales.\"</p>\n    <p>He denied this year's budget, which only passed due to the Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, was a missed opportunity to get more money to tackle issues in social care.</p>\n    <p>\"We are very strong on social care, the problem is Labour isn't,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Welsh government ministers made £100m worth of commitments to secure Dodd's abstention, including £30m for social care to tackle delayed discharges.</p>\n    <p>Elsewhere Sir Ed said boycotting the state dinner with president Donald Trump over the war in Gaza was not a missed chance to advocate for Welsh farmers and steel workers, ahead of a finalised UK-USA trade deal.</p>\n    <p>\"I've been to state banquets, they're lovely, but you never get to speak to the visiting head of state,\" he said, adding it was better to prompt a debate by not attending.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm gaining an opportunity to speak for farmers, to speak for steel workers, and to speak for our whole country, who, frankly, is fed up of Donald Trump, fed up of people like Elon Musk interfering with our democracy and undermining our economy.\"</p>\n    <h2>Analysis</h2>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats had a record performance across the UK in the last general election, but just one of those 72 seats was in Wales.</p>\n    <p>However in the Senedd, they have often used their one seat there to play an outsized role.</p>\n    <p>But the question is whether they have used these opportunities to their full advantage when it comes to increasing their vote share and reach.</p>\n    <p>Next year, they're hoping to expand outside their mid Wales stronghold and \"paint Wales in gold\", but are fighting for attention in an increasingly crowded field.</p>\n    <p>Not only has the emergence of Reform pushed them into fifth place in many polls, but the Green Party will also be fighting for votes over similar policy areas.</p>\n    <p>With a challenging campaign ahead, some will see today's public hints of a continuing rift between the party leaders as unhelpful and unwelcome.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rvpzy7gpqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <h2>What is the triple lock?</h2>\n    <p>The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">2.5%.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How many people get the state pension?</h2>\n    <p>There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.</p>\n    <p>People born after those dates claim the new state pension.</p>\n    <p>The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.</p>\n    <h2>What is the rise from next April?</h2>\n    <p>It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.</p>\n    <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">annual growth in earnings was 4.7%</a> for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.</p>\n    <p>The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">It was 3.8% in July</a> and is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.</p>\n    <p>The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.</p>\n    <h2>Is the triple lock popular?</h2>\n    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.</p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/uk-public-finances-obr-national-debt-gdp\">cost about three times more than initially expected</a> and suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.</p>\n    <p>Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.</p>\n    <p>Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.</p>\n    <h2>Could the triple lock be ditched?</h2>\n    <p>The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.</p>\n    <p>The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.</p>\n    <p>“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”</p>\n    <p>He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.</p>\n    <p>Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.</p>\n    <p>“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.</p>\n    <p>“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

However, Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n    <p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners,” he said. “It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n    <p>The latest figures are expected to translate into an annual rise worth more than £500 for those on the new state pension, which would increase from £230.25 a week to £241.05 a week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 a week to £184.75.</p>\n    <p>Successive governments have committed to the triple lock since it was first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">introduced by George Osborne in 2010</a>, despite criticism that protecting pensioner incomes comes with a costly price tag for the public purse and risks fuelling intergenerational inequalities.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that state pension costs will rise from about 5% of GDP now to about 8% by the 2070s. Half of the increase is driven by the triple lock, at a time of rising pressure on other areas of spending and social care.</p>\n    <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called for the policy to be scrapped. Heidi Karjalainen, a senior research economist at the thinktank, said: “The triple lock has so far been much costlier than initially expected, and it creates a lot of uncertainty in terms of future spending.</p>\n    <p>“If the economy is doing well then it won’t cost more than increasing the state pension in line with average earnings growth, whereas in volatile periods it can become very costly – as we have seen in the last decade and a half.”</p>\n    <p>It comes as official figures showed the UK’s jobs market has continued to cool, amid a slowdown in annual pay growth and rising redundancies.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said annual growth in regular earnings excluding bonuses slowed to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the three months to June, matching the forecasts of City economists.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The official unemployment rate was unchanged on the previous month in July, at 4.7%, the highest level in four years.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have complained since Reeves’s first autumn budget that her £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a> and 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” would force them to cut jobs and raise prices for consumers.</p>\n    <p>Economists said there was clear evidence of the jobs market cooling. Separate figures from HMRC showed a decline in the number of workers on company payrolls of 8,000, matching City forecasts.</p>\n    <p>After taking account of inflation, annual growth in regular pay was 1.2% in the three months to July, down from 1.5%.</p>\n    <p>Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget.

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation.

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’. This could well lead to an early-Autumn pullback in equity markets ahead of the next Fed meeting.”</p>\n<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire has suffered a blow from ratings agency Fitch overnight.</p>\n<p>Fitch has downgraded INEOS Group to ‘BB-’, with a negative outlook, down from BB. That’s a one-notch fall, to the 13th place on Fitch’s scale of credit worthiness, and still leaves Ineos ranked as ‘non-investment grade’.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision, Fitch points out that Ineos is increasingly highly leveraged, due to the “weak chemical market” and high spending on a new ethane cracker in the Port of Antwerp.</p>\n<p>Fitch also predicts that Ineos’s revenue to grow by 2% on average in 2025-2029, after growing 9% in 2024.</p>\n<p>A lower credit rating implies a higher risk of default, or debt restructuring, and can result in higher borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>A dried sunflower field in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian</p>\n<p>Last summer’s extremely hot weather was not great for the European and Ukrainian sunflower crop.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian and European sunflower oil prices have jumped, Bloomberg reports, as forecasters expect low yields in the country and limited production across the continent.</p>\n<p>That’s because the hot, dry summer hampered crop development.</p>\n<p>There are forecasts that Europe could see its worst sunflower harvest in a decade, while harvesting in Ukraine is slow following a drought this year.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, sunflower yields are expected to fall below the five-year average “largely due to the drought in the south, where most sunflower cultivation takes place,” the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a report.</p>\n<p>Europe is facing similar challenges, with top producer France expecting output to drop 15% below the five-year average, according to figures from the French agriculture ministry.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, retail sales were stronger than expected last month – which might deter the Federal Reserve from a surprisingly hefty interest rate cut tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Spending at retail and food services sites jumped by 0.6% month-on-month in August, and were 5% higher than in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Economists had expected a smaller rise, of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>It’s an encouraging sign for US economic growth, but could also encourage Fed policymakers to vote for a quarter-point cut to interest rates, rather than a larger, half-point cut.</p>\n<p>U.S. retail sales stronger than expected. Hindrance for a 50 bp cut tomorrow? #retail</p>\n<p>Spending at “nonstore retailers” (ie, internet shopping) were up 10.1% year-on-year, while spending at food service and drinking places rose 6.5% compared with a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Britain’ Competition and Markets Authority has launched a merger inquiry into payments provider Global Payments’ $24.25bn acquisition of rival Worldpay.</p>\n<p>The CMA will examine whether the deal, announed in April, could lessen competition in UK markets.</p>\n<p>The CMA has set a deadline of November 11 to reach its Phase 1 decision.</p>\n<p>It’s a year since former Italian PM Mario Draghi’s landmark report, which warned that the EU risked “agonising decline” without an €800bn investment boost.</p>\n<p>Today, Draghi has warned that Europe was “in a harder place” than one year ago, and suggested that Europe actually needs annual investments of nearly €1,200bn, up from €800bn last year, with increasing demand for defence.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/16/uk-wage-growth-slows-jobs-market-cools-business-live-news-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The incident made him reconsider the years he had spent reporting on the lives cut short by gun violence — and the stress it had put on his body.</p>\n    <p>\"For the first time really, I had to look deep and engage with what was truly bearing down on my heart,\" he says. \"And for me that had been more than a decade of telling stories of Black death and survival.\"</p>\n    <p>As a reporter in Trenton, Philadelphia and New Orleans, Lee covered the deaths of young men who looked like him. The victims were \"wearing my same sneakers, same haircut,\" he says. \"And you have to wrestle with seeing yourself in some ways, repeatedly gunned down, your body repeatedly falling. Tears for your death over and over and again.\"</p>\n    <p>Lee's new memoir, <i>A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America</i>, is part history, and part personal turning point. He traces the bloody history Black Americans have with firearms, recalls gun violence in his own youth and follows his ancestors' path back to Ghana. </p>\n    <p>The book reads like a plea for people to see the humanity of those lost to gun violence — and for this country to care enough to act.</p>\n    <p>\"We have an opportunity and we still have this opportunity to be the great nation that we've professed,\" Lee says. \"I'm not a policy maker. I don't profess to be an expert in gun policy. But what I do believe is that until we break our lust for these guns, nothing will change.\"</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1650x2550+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F66%2F8ac03d97466dac0623471ca1c01f%2F9781250098016.jpg\" alt=\"A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America, Trymaine Lee\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On President Trump's comments about the violence in majority-Black cities</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hearing the president talk about Chicago and Baltimore and other cities, and he goes on to talk about how people in these communities were \"<a href=\"https://x.com/barrie4council/status/1963252762944143506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1963252762944143506%7Ctwgr%5E2e3b618ba1118b0fcf9919e8b3992e510e09ea24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fprofessor-why-trumps-born-to-be-criminals-comment-shou-2000060818\">born to be criminal[s</a>].\" The violence is innate, right? There's something in these people that makes them inherently violent, and the gun is just their tool. </p>\n    <p>But I think one of the biggest things that people miss or don't fully understand is that there is a direct pipeline from a slew of places with super lax gun laws that are poured right into Chicago. And that every one of these guns starts legally. And so along the pipeline, from the factory to the wholesale market, to the retail market, to stores, to gun shows, there are all these places where guns are siphoned off by the so-called good guys with guns. And so while there is violence in Chicago and there is criminality in Chicago, there's criminality that happens long before then to allow these guns to pour into these cities in ecosystems and environments already [twisted] and bound by so much systemic violence and so much lack and so much hunger, and so much trauma that folks are carrying.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On speaking to the mothers of Black men and boys who were shot and killed</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There was this string of killings, starting with like Trayvon Martin, and I got close enough to the families where they trusted me to tell their stories. In the middle of all the noise, I had a direct line to most of these families. And the look in a mother's eyes in particular who has lost a son to murder or violence, it's like nothing you've ever seen. And I still see those eyes. I've never been able to remove those eyes, right? The pain that you see in them, the ocean of emotion welling up in them. And that no matter what we do, all the humanizing, all of the, you know, making sense of the systems and the police and the law and all those things will not bring their child back.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the importance of showing respect to the victims of violence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>And the actual process of gathering the information for your report is also tough because you have ask dumb questions. \"What did you see? What did you hear? What was it like the last time you talked to them?\" Questions that are intrusive and at the worst moment in someone's life. And then you're asking for a picture, right? And then, you're over there talking to the police.</p>\n    <p>There's something exploitative by nature: I'm getting so much more out of this than you are. But I always wanted to do it humanely and with great respect. And then you have to take that back to the newsroom. And I literally had an editor once — it was after a shooting and one young person was killed and I think another one was wounded — and he said, \"Oh, that's just a garden-variety killing.\" He described the killing of a young teenager. And mind you, we don't have any context to the situation. ... We don't know how, why, who. We don't anything. But this was so routine that it wasn't worth covering. \"Don't worry about it, it's garden variety.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling with the notion of \"objectivity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The kind of objectivity that we're so often taught in this practice is a blindness. It's like a convenient ignoring of what you actually see. I think what's more appropriate is fairness. And that objectivity in that notion, it's an arm's length from your subject matter. And I never fully believed in that part. I think you have to have your facts right. I think that you have to be fair to people on as many sides as there are. But the notion of objectivity never rang solid for me.</p>\n    <p>What I managed to do, and I hope I continue to do in putting shape to the experiences of people, is going to the people and telling their story as openly and honestly as possible, and painting the picture, and bringing people into their experiences. And even when it's painful, giving a little bit of that pain for everybody to hold. Hold a little of this. If she has to hold some; you have to hold some too.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On tracing a gun from manufacturer to use</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It was so important, I think, to connect the dots between what's happening in factory towns in Massachusetts where these guns are produced, to the communities where these are so easily bought and sold with very little regulation, in the South mostly, to how they end up in Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit and Philadelphia … to show that there is no disconnect, that it's one long string, and that no one is left off of the broad ripple of impact here.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

In the announcement, Sze says he intends to focus on promoting translated poetry. \"As laureate I feel a great responsibility to promote the ways poetry, especially poetry in translation, can impact our daily lives,\" he wrote in the announcement. \"We live in such a fast-paced world: poetry helps us slow down, deepen our attention, connect and live more fully.\"</p>\n    <p>Sze, born in New York City, is a child of Chinese immigrants. He studied math and science at MIT in 1968. But in a 1998 interview with WHYY's <i>Fresh Air</i>, he said he found himself \"totally bored\" in a classroom and found himself writing all the time instead. So he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to study poetry. Since then, he's written 12 poetry collections, including 2025's <i>Into the Hush</i>.</p>\n    <p>In 2006, Sze became the poet laureate of Santa Fe, where he's lived for a long time. In 2015, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. And in 2019, he won the National Book Award for his collection <i>Sight Lines. </i></p>\n    <p>In the announcement, acting Librarian of Congress Robert R. Newlen praised Sze's poetry as \"distinctly American\" in how he portrayed the Southwest. \"Like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences — and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5539826/u-s-poet-laureate-arthur-sze-ada-limo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.</p>\n    <p>However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.</p>\n    <p>His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Green Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Listen to James read this article </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.</p>\n<p>All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.</p>\n<p>This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.</p>\n<p>There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.</p>\n<p>And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.</p>\n<h2>How Windsor became 'Trumpton'</h2>\n<p>For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.</p>\n<p>Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.</p>\n<p>For Palace officials, attention to detail is all.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.</p>\n<p>It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.</p>\n<p>\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider.</p>\n<p>\"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".</p>\n<p>King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.</p>\n<p>Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.</p>\n<h2>'Pressure to make this massive'</h2>\n<p>So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.</p>\n<p>The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.</p>\n<p>\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.</p>\n<p>The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)</p>\n<p>For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"</p>\n<p>Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"</p>\n<h2>The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests</h2>\n<p>Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"</p>\n<p>Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.</p>\n<p>They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.</p>\n<p>\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"</p>\n<p>For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.</p>\n<h2>Serious business behind the pageantry</h2>\n<p>Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.</p>\n<p>Ministers hope to complete a deal to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yp5qzeer6o\">exclude UK steel</a> and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.</p>\n<p>The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>\n<p>This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".</p>\n<p>All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.</p>\n<p>The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.</p>\n<p>\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.</p>\n<p>\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"</p>\n<p>Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.</p>\n<p>\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"</p>\n<h2>The Mandelson question</h2>\n<p>For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p>The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?</p>\n<p>Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.</p>\n<p>According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.</p>\n<p>It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.</p>\n<p>Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p>\n    <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p>\n    <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p>\n    <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p>\n    <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p>\n    <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/aldis-uk-boss-warns-shoppers-face-higher-food-prices-if-budget-heaps-extra-costs-on-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p>\n    <p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p>\n    <p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants. It would supply the DP World’s London Gateway port and business park.</p>\n    <p>The government said more nuclear facilities were needed for clean homegrown power to ensure energy security, with the commercial deals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">Starmer’s announcement this year</a> of the biggest expansion of nuclear power in generations, and the eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment\">go-ahead for the new Sizewell C</a> station in Suffolk with billions in state funding.</p>\n    <p>Ministers also hope to attract major US tech investment in AI datacentres with the promise of abundant electricity to meet their huge power requirements.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The US secretary of energy, Chris Wright, said the US was looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution”. He said: “Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”</p>\n    <p>The deals, he added, would “unleash commercial access in both the US and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening US energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”</p>\n    <p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the transatlantic deals would contribute to the sector’s “industrial revival, creating thousands of high-value jobs, and strengthening the UK’s energy security”.</p>\n    <p>As well as attempting to reduce broader reliance on overseas energy, the UK-US agreement – known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy – will look to eliminate any remaining dependency on Russian nuclear material by the end of 2028.</p>\n    <p>The deal will mean both countries fast-track reactor design checks by collaborating and accepting regulatory assessments from the other, avoiding duplicating bureaucracy. The government said this streamlined approach would help British exports, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup\">Rolls-Royce</a> in the process of getting its small modular reactor design approved in the US.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/uk-and-us-line-up-string-of-deals-to-build-modular-nuclear-reactors-in-britain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

They were followed by other Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy and Portugal.</p>\n    <p>The economists from the University of Mannheim and the European Central Bank described the results as “conservative” because they did not account for the record-breaking wildfires that torched southern Europe last month or the compounding impact of extreme weather events that strike at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Sehrish Usman, an economist at the University of Mannheim and the lead author of the study, said the study’s “timely estimates” could help policymakers target support in the absence of official data. “The true costs of extreme weather surface slowly because these events aﬀect lives and livelihoods through a wide range of channels that extend beyond the initial impact.”</p>\n    <p>Scientists have raced to work out the extent to which global heating has worsened punishing weather extremes this summer, with studies suggesting climate breakdown made scorching fire weather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/04/spain-portugal-wildfire-weather-climate-crisis-study\">40 times more likely</a> in Spain and Portugal, and <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/weather-conditions-leading-to-deadly-wildfires-in-turkiye-cyprus-and-greece-made-10-times-more-likely-due-to-climate-change/\">10 times more likely</a> in Greece and Turkey. The death toll from the “quietly devastating” June heatwave is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/09/europe-june-heatwave-study-climate-breakdown-tripled-death-toll\">tripled in 12 big cities</a> because of planet-heating pollution.</p>\n    <p>While most research into the economic costs of climate breakdown looks at direct impacts, such as destroyed assets or insured losses, the authors of the new study used historical relationships between violent weather and economic output to account for ripple effects, such the limited hours that builders can work during heatwaves or the disruption to commute times after floods damage railways.</p>\n    <p>Stéphane Hallegatte, the chief climate economist at the World Bank, who was not involved in the study, said it confirmed that the wider economic impacts of extreme weather were larger than the direct effects and last longer than people imagine.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve been arguing for a long time to shift our focus from the direct damages from disasters to broader metrics that capture a fuller economic impact, so I’m very happy to see the study doing exactly that,” he said.</p>\n    <p>But he warned that it used “imperfect proxies” to identify extreme weather, which would likely lead to underestimating the full costs. The GVA did not capture the full cost of extreme weather on people and firms, he added, or the benefits of reducing vulnerability.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“Especially when disasters affect poor communities and people, the impact on GVA may be minimal, because these people are poor,” said Hallegatte. “But it does not mean they won’t suffer.”</p>\n    <p>Gert Bijnens, an economist at the National Bank of Belgium, who was not involved in the study, said supply chain disruption was one of the most significant “hidden costs” that usually went uncounted. A <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/doc/ts/publications/wp/wp466en.pdf\">study he coauthored</a> on the costs of the devastating Belgian floods in 2021 found that sales at manufacturing firms far from the disaster fell sharply if they had long-standing suppliers in the flood zones.</p>\n    <p>Ignoring such effects could underestimate damages by as much as 30%, Bijnen said.</p>\n    <p>“Of course, such estimates come with uncertainty as they rely on historical averages and can’t yet fully capture compounding events,” he added. “But the big message is clear: extreme weather is already leaving a sizeable economic footprint, and the indirect effects can be just as damaging as the direct destruction.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/europes-summer-of-extreme-weather-caused-43bn-of-short-term-losses-analysis-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

In 2016, as Venezuela's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031871225/bonus-venezuelas-rise-and-fall\">socioeconomic crisis</a> deepened, Caceres moved to the United States and found a position as a textile designer.</p>\n    <p>\"When I moved here, I was working designing for other people. I wasn't doing anything for myself,\" she said. \"I didn't have time to do anything for myself.\"</p>\n    <p>Worst of all, she had to leave Tobi back in Venezuela. She missed him immensely, and she craved a creative outlet to help her through all the transitions she was going through. So she started a project: Every day, for a whole year, she would draw a different dog. She called the project \"A Dog A Day Keeps the Stress Away,\" and the first dog she drew in January 2018 was, of course, Tobi.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4284x5712+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fba%2Fea1a25754d5d89e48c9345dddf20%2Fandrea-caceres-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Courtesy of Andrea Cáceres\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <p>The illustrations took off.

Inside was an American flag that had flown over the Capitol — sent as a gesture of appreciation for Xie Xide, the renowned Chinese scientist who had recently died. Xie had played a key role in fostering cultural and scientific exchanges between the two countries.</p><p>Stories like this are almost inconceivable today in both the United States and China, as the tone of their bilateral relations has fundamentally shifted. But in the new book, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-encounters-with-america/9780231217194/\"> Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China</a>, profiles of 12 Chinese individuals remind us of the optimism that once defined the two countries' engagement. This optimism has faded away in recent years. </p><p>The dozen profiles in this edited volume highlight the positive aspects of U.S.-China exchange, which began in earnest after diplomatic relations were established in 1979. These accounts range from academics like Xie Xide, to environmental activists like Ma Tianjie, and diplomats like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-f3ada042a03faf8523ff08d270e5e051\">Ji Chaozhu</a>, who served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972.</p><p>Today, as the U.S. and China find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories may be interpreted differently, depending on the reader's own views on the once-popular engagement policy. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, however brief it may have been.</p><p>The book's co-editors, Deborah Davis — a leading sociologist on China — and Terry Lautz, author of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/americans-in-china-9780197512838\"> Americans in China</a>, argue that the book underscores the value of finding common ground. They express concern that both Americans and Chinese are losing sight of their shared interests and the benefits that have come from cooperation.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fea%2F385436a74672a17e60f0bcc1667d%2Famericansinchina-cover.jpg\" alt=\"AmericansInChina Cover.jpg\"/><p>In an email exchange with NPR, the editors sent joint responses to questions about the issues addressed in the book. Here is an edited version of the exchange.</p><p><strong>NPR: You said you were concerned that both Americans and Chinese had lost sight of their shared interests. Why, in your view, did this happen?  </strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz:</strong> China's unexpected arrival as a major economic and military power triggered a downward spiral in the U.S.-China relations. Washington saw China's ascent and its hardline diplomacy as a challenge to the existing world order. Beijing viewed the United States as a threat to its interests, especially the PRC's claim to the island of Taiwan. This new power dynamic undermined the long-held assumption that Sino-American engagement would lead to positive, peaceful change. Instead, it produced a climate of fear and distrust. The aim of our book is to show the benefits of cooperation and mutual understanding despite our differences.</p><p><strong>NPR: In short, how has encountering the U.S. changed these individuals —  and China itself?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>The impact varies over time. Those who returned to an impoverished China during the Cold War faced different challenges and had different motives from those who returned in the 1990s or 2000s when China was more open politically and prosperous. The consequences of their encounters also vary by occupation — from education, dance, and diplomacy to civil society, science, and sports.</p><p>Their life stories are remarkable. For example, Xie Xide, a renowned physicist who received her PhD from MIT in 1951, became the first woman president of a major Chinese research university in 1983. But she also spent years cleaning floors during the Cultural Revolution. Wang Jisi, one of China's most prominent America watchers, spent seven years herding sheep in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution before entering Peking University in 1978. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3726969\">Lang Ping</a>, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/07/04/6647713/pianist-has-passion-for-performing-new-music\">Peng-Peng Gong</a> was trained at the Juilliard School in New York but walked away from a lucrative career as an international concert pianist and returned to China as the resident composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. He calls himself \"a translator in both directions.\"</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2090+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Ffb%2Fd51a0e21409a9fd0e550410e76cf%2Fgettyimages-53145099.jpg\" alt=\"Lang Ping, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women’s volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China’s team to gold at the 2014 World Championships.\"/><p>\n                Lang Ping, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    China Photos/Getty Images/Getty Images AsiaPac\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p><p><strong/></p><strong>toggle caption</strong><p><strong>NPR: Among the 12 individuals you profiled, whose story resonated with you the most — and why?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>It's difficult to pick only one, but the diplomat and interpreter Ji Chaozhu stands out because his life mirrored the dramatic ups and downs of Chinese politics and U.S.-China relations. The Chinese Communist Party sent his family to New York City when he was a boy and by the time he returned to New China in 1950, after his sophomore year at Harvard, he could barely speak Chinese.</p><p>The Foreign Ministry sent Ji to make English transcripts of the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom during the Korean War. But because of his American background, it took several years before he could join the Party. He was \"sent down\" to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution but reemerged to interpret for Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai during President Nixon's trip in 1972 and accompanied Deng Xiaoping to the United States in 1979. There were times when he could have sought asylum abroad, but he remained patriotic, convinced that the Communist Party was the best choice for his country's future.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2560x1920+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2018%2F06%2F11%2Fap_7202281627.jpg\" alt=\"President Richard Nixon and China's Premier Chou En-lai pose together at Shanghai Airport before the Nixon departs for the United States on Feb. 28, 1972.\"/><p>\n                Ji Chaozhu (left) served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972.

Did this perspective resonate with any of the individuals you wrote about?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>From what we know of their public lives, none of them would say that engagement with the United States was a mistake— for themselves, for China, or China's relations with America. To the contrary, they came back from the U.S. with knowledge and skills that could be used to make China a strong modern nation. And that's exactly what they did. It was a complex process of adapting what they had learned to fit China's needs while working to improve China's understanding of the United States. All of them saw engagement as an opportunity to advance their careers and to enhance China's global status.</p><p><strong>NPR: Your book spans the Cold War, reconciliation, reform, engagement, and ends with globalization and cooperation. If you were to continue, who might you choose to profile in the current climate of rivalry and distrust?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>We would probably choose someone in science and technology. Take, for example, Abigail Coplin's chapter about Deng Xing Wang, a brilliant plant biologist who grew up in poverty in a farming village in Hunan province. When he left China for graduate study at University of California, Berkeley in 1985, no one could have imagined he would become a chaired professor at Yale University. And no one could have predicted that he would give that up and return to China to start his own company and direct a major research institute. While our governments may see \"American science\" and \"Chinese science\" as separate entities, Deng's story shows that cutting edge research thrives on cooperation as well as competition across national boundaries.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/g-s1-87796/chinese-encounters-with-america-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\"What a week. What a mess.\" A senior Labour MP is not the only one in disbelief at the latest - you couldn't make it up - mishap for this government.</p>\n<p>How Downing Street handled revelations about Lord Mandelson's friendship with the wealthy paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was the first test of the new senior team in No 10.</p>\n<p>The uncharitable view is they flunked it by not acting quickly enough – putting the prime minister's face on the calamity by sending him into the bearpit of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) with a staunch defence of his man in Washington.</p>\n<p>They knew there were new allegations about his relationship with Epstein. The direction of travel seemed set - and Mandelson would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>The even more uncomfortable factor is that last week the prime minister defended another colleague, Angela Rayner, when - you guessed it - the direction of travel in Westminster seemed set, and she would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">undermined the prime minister's own authority</a> and blown the chance of a quick autumn reset for Labour, when the party was desperately trying to turn the page.</p>\n<p>The more generous argument made by Sir Keir's allies - he's been let down by two different people in two different ways, and has had to front up to clean up their different messes.</p>\n<p>\"Keir is frustrated and a bit angry because he is having to deal with the conduct of others, rather than show what he is trying to do,\" one source says.</p>\n<p>Another says: \"He hired someone who didn't tell him the full truth.\"</p>\n<p>No 10 doesn't imagine that the damage of the last fortnight of farce is limited to those who have departed government.</p>\n<p>And as they absorb the scale of the embarrassment over Mandelson's friendship with Epstein, new details over who knew what - and when - are emerging all the time.</p>\n<p>Westminster sources have suggested the prime minister himself had raised questions about Mandelson's links with Epstein during an initial vetting process carried out by the Cabinet Office before he was given the job.</p>\n<p>But then he was checked out again by the Foreign Office once he'd been appointed.</p>\n<h2>So where did it all begin?</h2>\n<p>Even before Labour won the election in 2024 there had been a desire in Sir Keir's circle to look beyond the traditional diplomatic appointment for their ambassador to the White House, one of the government's plum jobs.</p>\n<p>They had noted how the former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was sent to DC and determined that a politician could be the right choice.</p>\n<p>With his experience as a trade commissioner, an impressive spider's web of contacts, and respected political nous, Mandelson was soon determined to be an excellent potential fit.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's powerful chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, believed there were only two qualified candidates for the role, and was enthusiastic about Mandelson.</p>\n<p>Before the final decision was made last autumn, the Cabinet Office was asked, as it would be for any such candidate, to consider whether he was fit to be offered the job.</p>\n<p>Already at that stage it was no secret Mandelson had been friends with Epstein, so it was obvious those links would need to be considered.</p>\n<p>I'm told a file on Mandelson from the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET), whose job it is to know where the bodies are buried in Whitehall, was presented to the prime minister that included information about his relationship with the disgraced millionaire.</p>\n<p>On reading this file, Sir Keir had three questions he wanted to clarify with the peer, a No 10 source tells me: Why had he continued his friendship with Epstein after he was first convicted and not broken contact with him?</p>\n<p>Why had he stayed at one of Epstein's houses when the financier was in jail?</p>\n<p>And was he a \"founding citizen\" of an ocean conservation charity that Epstein had backed?</p>\n<p>That trio of questions was put to Mandelson in an email from Sir Keir's chief of staff McSweeney on his behalf.</p>\n<p>The peer, I'm told, replied to those questions in an email in which Downing Street sources now say he was \"economical with the truth\".</p>\n<p>It's understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009 while Epstein was in prison. Another source confirmed that he told Downing Street he had not stayed there.</p>\n<p>Court documents revealed in 2023 Epstein told his private banker that Mandelson would be staying at the property. Mandelson has never explicitly denied or confirmed he did, although it has been reported that he had no recollection of doing so.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that none of those issues - the possible house stay, the charity, or the continued friendship - were discovered during the vetting process. They had been reported in previous years.</p>\n<p>But the guarantees relayed to the prime minister by Mandelson were considered sufficient to be worth the gamble of giving him the job.</p>\n<p>Once the appointment was then made, sources suggest the \"developed vetting\" process then kicked in, under the auspices of the Foreign Office.</p>\n<p>The normal process for government appointments is dependent on the job being given and the sensitivity of the material and information to be handled.</p>\n<p>But there is scarcely a job with a higher level of trust required than the White House ambassador, given the two countries' links on security, defence, trade and intelligence.</p>\n<p>I'm told nothing was flagged to No 10 as a result of the DV process, which would have involved an in-person interview which in this case, \"ought to have been completely forensic, but they must have used the wrong lens,\" according to another senior figure.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PET file, Downing Street would not receive the results of such a process as a matter of course, even in an extremely high-profile appointment. The DV process is a standalone routine.</p>\n<p>And Downing Street sources insist that they weren't made aware of any problems, so everything went ahead.</p>\n<p>The upshot? Even though there were two different processes checking out Mandelson's background, which publicly was known to include dealings with a notorious wealthy sex offender, neither appear to have turned up anything major - nor the now notorious emails which investigative reporters were able to locate recently.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall insider told me it was \"staggering - either they skipped the process of any basic due diligence, or they did that process and missed the obvious questions\".</p>\n<p>\"No one involved in making the appointment cared enough to check whether all the risk had been identified in appointing a man who had twice previously had to resign over his judgement. Careless doesn't cover it.\"</p>\n<p>The government has repeatedly said this week that part of the problem was the messages between Mandelson and Epstein were from a defunct email address.</p>\n<p>Yet a senior Whitehall figure tells me it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done.</p>\n<p>Neither Downing Street nor the Cabinet Office wanted to comment.</p>\n<p>Until this week, it seemed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd1egrlj0mo\">No 10's calculated risk of appointing Mandelson</a> was paying off.</p>\n<p>Not just because US President Donald Trump appeared to enjoy his company, praising his \"beautiful accent\" on camera recently in the Oval Office, but also because the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8dnm4dv2zo\">UK had got its trade deal</a>.</p>\n<p>The state visit was all about to unfold in its pomp and glory. Sir Keir appeared, unlike many other global leaders, to have managed to build a warm and functional relationship with the most powerful man in the western world.</p>\n<p>All of that, at least partly down to the smooth talking and politicking of the ambassador.</p>\n<p>What he and No 10 were enjoying as a successful tenure was to be suddenly disrupted when the peer featured in what's known as the Epstein \"birthday book\". It features a cosy message - Mandelson branding Epstein his \"best pal\", and a photograph of the two in which Mandelson is wearing a bathrobe.</p>\n<p>And what was to prove more serious, reporters at the news agency Bloomberg managed to get hold of a cache of Epstein's emails, which included his communications with Mandelson over months and years.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to get ahead of the story, Mandelson predicted that a whole slew of contact between the two was about to emerge into public view - and he described the revelations to The Sun as \"very embarrassing\". This sent alarm bells clanging back in Whitehall.</p>\n<p>He hadn't shared the contents of the emails with Downing Street and had been \"dismissive, claiming there was nothing new\" in the stories emerging about his friendship with Epstein earlier in the week, sources suggest.</p>\n<p>But, by late on Tuesday, the government was aware that more damaging allegations were coming, and contacted the peer to ask what was going on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8j2d5xm78o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

Take Lin-Manuel Miranda, a composer, lyricist, director and actor best known for creating the musical <i>Hamilton</i>. Not only has he won a \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation, but he's been called a genius in publications like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lin-manuel-miranda-ingenuity-awards-180957234/\"> Smithsonian Magazine</a>, </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/16/why-love-lin-manuel-miranda-crush-bim-adewunmi\">and</a></p><i>The</i><i>Guardian</i><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/yay-hamlet\">BuzzFeed</a>.</p><p>Genius implies something solitary, and we often think of it as innate. Even so, Miranda wasn't the best student when he was young; teachers weren't swooning over his early promise. As Miranda told Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, the author of a new biography, <i>Lin-Manuel Miranda: The Education of an Artist</i>: \"I was never the brightest student at Hunter College Elementary School, but I was good at making up songs, and I was good at making kids laugh, which is the only currency that matters when you are surrounded by people who are much smarter than you.\"</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and a visiting scholar at Portland State University, says that although Miranda is undeniably talented and works very, very hard, his superpower is that he cultivates, collaborates with — and is constantly learning from — a large group of creative friends.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner's new book traces Miranda's career from elementary school musicals, to writing and starring in Disney movies, to his concept album based on the cult-classic film <i>The Warriors</i>.</p><p>Miranda, who has <a href=\"https://x.com/Lin_Manuel/status/667845524171661312\">Puerto Rican and Mexican</a> heritage, grew up in a neighborhood at the top of Manhattan, surrounded by the Latino community he extols in his Tony award-winning musical <i>In the Heights</i>. But he went to school on the snootier, more white Upper East side, which was a tremendous adjustment. He struggled at first — math made him anxious, he disliked his nose, as Pollack-Pelzner writes — but, like a lot of people who feel like they don't fit in, he gravitated toward theater.</p><p>Theater gave Miranda a place to try out his ideas, and he reached out to talented people he knew to help get them up on stage. Pollack-Pelzner writes that Miranda collects people who can teach him something, keeping many of them as lifelong collaborators: one particular friend taught him a bit about composing music; others helped him learn to freestyle. When he was hired to translate some lyrics in <i>West Side Story</i> into Spanish for a new Broadway production, he met the late composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim — and Sondheim became a mentor, helping him navigate the world of musical theater.</p><p>His family has also been a strong source of support. His mother Luz Towns-Miranda, a therapist, helped him process the big feelings that he'd later turn into songs, Pollack-Pelzner explains. His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr., a political strategist, helped him with everything from Puerto Rican slang to financial support for his productions. Miranda's wife, Vanessa Nadal, has also contributed to his successes — she prodded him to include a song for the women in <i>Hamilton</i>, which became \"The Schuyler Sisters.\"</p><p>Miranda regularly publicly thanks and praises those who have supported and taught him, and who have contributed their ideas and talents to his work. That they feel validated by him is evident from the many thoughtful, warm quotes in the book. Pollack-Pelzner says he interviewed more than 150 people and met with Miranda himself more than a dozen times. Miranda shared with him \"early scripts, rough recordings, and grainy videos of sixth-grade musicals, high school one-acts, college projects and pre-Broadway experiments,\" he writes.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner is at his strongest when he delves into the fascinating nitty gritty of the collaborations that help productions come together. People call Miranda a genius because he seamlessly mashes seemingly disparate ideas together (the American Revolution and hip-hop!) to make work that is sparkling with joy, emotionally resonant and blazingly new. And Pollack-Pelzner brings us so deeply into this work — tracing the birth of individual songs line by line — that we feel the zing of creation.</p><p>But this is not a hagiography. Pollack-Pelzner is frank about Miranda's shortcomings, such as the time when the original cast of <i>Hamilton</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/theater/hamilton-producers-and-actors-reach-deal-on-sharing-profits.html\">was fighting to share 1% of the profits</a> for the show's runaway success. Like many original casts, they had helped foster its development. Miranda — who was both a cast member who received a pay check and a creator who received royalties — tried to stay out of it, instead of advocating for them with the lead producer, and he felt \"othered\" by the cast, Pollack-Pelzner explains.</p><p>The book also wades into the murk around Miranda's attempt to influence politics.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2018/06/08/lin-manuel-miranda-amplifies-puerto-rico-fundraising-efforts-with-google-org-2m-matching-grant/\">Miranda raised millions of dollars for relief </a>after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017; he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lin-manuel-miranda-s-hamilton-funds-give-puerto-rican-art-n1040891\">wanted to raise more by bringing  Hamilton</a> to the University of Puerto Rico, his father's alma mater. But in 2016, he had asked Congress in an op-ed to support a bill that would restructure the territory's significant debt. The University of Puerto Rico had been particularly negatively affected — budgets were cut, employees threatened to strike and students protested.</p><p>\"Boy, is <i>Hamilton</i> a bad fit for raising money for Puerto Rico,\" Miranda is quoted as saying in the book. \"It's singing about the financial system that traps Puerto Rico in debt.\"</p><p>The show had to be moved to a different venue and Miranda wound up swearing off politics.</p><h4>Performing Arts</h4><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h2><h4>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h4><p>And yet, it was still a homecoming. When he sang, \"My name is Alexander Hamilton,\" the book recounts, \"Two thousand people rose in a standing ovation that seemed like it would last forever. 'It was the first time I <i>felt</i> a cheer,' he said after the show. 'I felt my hair move.'\"</p><p>But of course, he didn't keep all the praise for himself — at the end of the show, he brought his father onstage to thank him.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner uses these details to treat Miranda as the creator he is — enthusiastic, vulnerable, ambitious, innovative, fallible — instead of as a mere celebrity. A different biographer might have used this as an occasion for dishy name dropping, but Pollack-Pelzner builds the case that Miranda is so successful because he is able to take all the contradictions of who he is, what he's experienced, who he knows, and combine them into work that speaks to so many. And it could be that this talent is, in fact, genius.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5532081/lin-manuel-miranda-biography-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was sent by Mandelson to Epstein in 2008, as the financier prepared to be jailed for soliciting prostitution from someone aged under 18.</p>\n    <p>\"Fight for early release,\" Lord Mandelson is quoted as writing, adding \"your friends stay with you and love you\".</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson doesn't deny these emails.</p>\n    <p>In a statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of his innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\"</p>\n    <p>We have asked him to respond to Bloomberg's revelations.</p>\n    <p>At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked Sir Keir about Lord Mandelson and whether it was \"tenable\" for him to remain as ambassador.</p>\n    <p>Among Labour MPs, there is exasperation.</p>\n    <p>\"I am angry about Keir defending Mandelson today. Mandelson has to go, and it really questions Keir's judgement in my eyes,\" one texts.</p>\n    <p>Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is running for the deputy leadership of Labour, has publicly called for Lord Mandelson to resign, as has the former shadow cabinet minister Andy McDonald.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives have tabled a slew of parliamentary questions to try to tease out further details about what was known by who and when.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street insists it has full confidence in Lord Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>But this isn't going away.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36k0k8kkpwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The document revealed that Russia had launched two cyber attacks prior to the election, one against a company that sold software related to voter registration, and another against 122 local election officials. </p>\n    <p>The contractor, an Air Force veteran named <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/06/531722218/what-we-know-about-reality-winner-government-contractor-accused-of-nsa-leak\">Reality Winner</a>, sent the document to <i>The Intercept, </i>a journalism site specializing in reporting leaks. But Winner admits now that she made a crucial miscalculation.</p>\n    <p>\"What I had assumed was they would receive it [and] immediately assume that this was something that was important, that it answered very important questions that the country was having, that it would be protected,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>That's not what happened. Instead, in the process of fact-checking the document, the reporters assigned to the story sent the document to the FBI, which sent it to the NSA. The security agency easily identified Winner, a crypto linguist, as the source of the leak.</p>\n    <p>Looking back now, Winner says her timing could not have been worse; the Trump administration had been combatting a string of leaks. FBI director <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/17/602849276/james-comey-to-fresh-air-the-fbi-isnt-on-anybodys-side\">James Comey</a> and the president \"were both saying that they were going to nail the next leaker to the wall,\" she says. \"And then I just happened to be the very next name popping up.\"</p>\n    <p>Winner was tried under the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/28/534682231/once-reserved-for-spies-espionage-act-now-used-against-suspected-leakers\">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and received the longest sentence to that point for leaking classified information to a media outlet. She accepted a plea deal, lowering her sentence of 10 years to five. She was released from prison in 2021.</p>\n    <p>Winner's story has been told in a 2021 documentary <i>Reality Winner</i>, the 2023 film <i>Reality, </i>and in<i> </i>the play <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1044602235/is-this-a-room-reality-winner-play\"> Is This A Room</a>, in which actors reenacted the transcript of the FBI interrogation of her. Now, she's looking back in a memoir titled</p>\n    <p><i>I Am Not Your Enemy.</i>It's not a tell-all, she says, because she's still bound by the non-disclosure agreement she signed with the NSA.</p>\n    <p>\"I am under a lasting ... non-disclosure agreement to never talk about anything that could be related to classified information from my Air Force career as a linguist, and then, moving forward, anything that I had done as an NSA contractor, and furthermore, anything within the four corners of the document that I leaked,\" she says.</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/994x1500+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2Fd3%2Fd5218f2c49f7a722cdad2adfc1e9%2F71vkiu11jhl-sl1500.jpg\" alt=\"71VKiU11JHL._SL1500_.jpg\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what it was like in the Georgia county jail </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The conditions of that county jail in Lincoln County, Ga. were abhorrent. ... I had been sheltered and privileged and naïve before that. I did not ever imagine that conditions like that would be considered normal or even good for any American in custody. And I was assured several times over that I was being treated the best and that was the most comfortable county jail in the area.</p>\n    <p>I was given this plastic mat with this crumpled plastic wool falling out of it [to sleep on]. It was held together with duct tape. That was my mat. … There was one sink, a picnic table that was covered in rust in the center of the room, a toilet that was about three feet away from that picnic table that we were supposed to sit and eat at, and a shower directly by the toilet with a black mold-crusted shower curtain over it. There was something so dystopian about it. … The toilet had a brown bedsheet draped over it so that you didn't have to eat at the table and make eye contact with somebody using the toilet.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On being transferred to a federal prison in Carswell, Texas</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>My first week there, I felt like I was at Harvard. I couldn't believe how big the compound was. It was two buildings and a very small rec center with a concrete track. <strong>… </strong>My sensory deprivation of 15, 16 months only existing in one room [in the Georgia county jail], I just remembered walking around Carswell and thinking, I'm going to get lost here every single day. It's just so big.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiencing COVID-19 restrictions in prison</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We were confined to our cells, which did not have restrooms. So we had to ask 24-7, seven days a week, to go use the restroom from another adult. We were no longer allowed to go outside and our movements were controlled around the unit. We couldn't just shower when we wanted to shower or go use their phones. As they eased up, we were still not allowed outside of the unit. …</p>\n    <p>The positive mail kept me going. I also had a network where I could just ask for any book I wanted and it would show up. So in addition to getting every single book I heard you talk about on <i>Fresh Air</i> for four years, I was basically the library for everybody in the unit. They would give me their requests and people's books would show up.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling after her release, especially with darkness</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the first time in four years, I had actually seen what a dark room looked like. … I had never been alone in a room before, with the exception of solitary confinement, but that wasn't really alone. So I was just so terrified all the time. I could not feel at ease in any way, shape or form. I never expected that would be something that I would feel. … Nobody tells you that once you get out of prison life just gets harder.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On conflict with her mother after her release</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The biggest point of contention between my mother and I was the status of my notoriety and the fact that she had been out for four years doing interviews about me and ... that she felt obligated to tell her Twitter following updates about me while the halfway house was saying, \"If your presence is detected on social media, or if we feel like you're communicating on social in any way, or that we feel you're in danger, we will take you back into custody.\" And my mother had wanted to tweet that I was home. And I said that they would take me back into custody if people knew I was at that home address. And she said that she wanted to be truthful to her following. And I just felt so offended, like the only reason why you had that following was to support me and I'm sitting right here in front of you and you care more about them than me. … I felt like while I was at my most vulnerable, she was still processing things through being interviewed about me instead of being my mom. And, you know, our relationship is still on the mend.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what she's doing now</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I'm a level two CrossFit coach and I am currently going to Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville in the veterinary technology program. … We did have to send attorneys for permission to at least take the state licensing test so that I could help my school out with passing rates, but [as a convicted felon] I will never be a licensed vet tech.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"</p>\n    <p>And yet the calculation Sir Keir made, alongside his top foreign affairs adviser Jonathan Powell and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, was that Lord Mandelson's talents outweighed the risks.</p>\n    <p>Allies of the outgoing ambassador still suggest it was probably the right decision considering what the PM knew last autumn.</p>\n    <p>\"If you look at his success in the role, the reasons for appointing him were vindicated,\" said a friend of the peer. \"He's been good on trade and built a strong relationship with the White House. He's been exemplary.\"</p>\n    <p>Former President George W Bush nicknamed Lord Mandelson \"Silvertongue\". The peer knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, has met Elon Musk, and holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p>\n    <p>Part of the irony of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein is that he shares that very same link with President Trump - proof of a top level if murky network among US elites.</p>\n    <p>After four decades in politics, Lord Mandelson's career in public life now seems sure to be over.</p>\n    <p>But questions about the prime minister's judgement remain.</p>\n    <p>Last autumn, Sir Keir decided that being friends with a convicted paedophile in the past should not exclude someone from high public office.</p>\n    <p>This week the volume, scale and excruciating details of the pair's contacts, plus the revelation that the peer encouraged the paedophile to challenge his conviction changed the PM's view.</p>\n    <p>Many Labour MPs think their leader should have seen this scandal a mile off.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd1egrlj0mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

He is wearing glasses and a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie. \"/>\n    <p>Peter Mandelson has been sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US, after revelations emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n    <p>Given the job in December 2024, he was the man Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer tasked with building links to the incoming Trump administration.</p>\n    <p>No 10 believed Lord Mandelson's ability as a networker and seasoned political operator was a valuable asset. Indeed, he was dubbed the Trump whisperer, and his close relationship with the White House were clear to see.</p>\n    <p>But it is due to one of his former connections that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">he has now lost</a> this plum diplomatic role.</p>\n    <p>And it is far from the first time Lord Mandelson has lost his job, in a turbulent 40-year-long career in British politics.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was born into Labour Party royalty - his grandfather was Herbert Morrison, a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee's 1945 government, revered by Labour members.</p>\n    <p>He began working for Labour in the 1980s, when the party was at its lowest ebb, suffering successive defeats to Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>The painful 1992 defeat - when Neil Kinnock's Labour were unexpectedly beaten - spurred Mandelson in his belief that the party needed to modernise if they were ever to get back into government.</p>\n    <p>In 1994, he played a pivotal role in getting Tony Blair elected as party leader - crucially backing him over Gordon Brown, who had been seen as the heir apparent.</p>\n    <p>For a long time it seemed that Brown would never forgive his former ally for this, in his eyes, betrayal.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67b9/live/2858bc60-8f13-11f0-bf0b-13ad835103b3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson\"/>\n    <p>Despite lingering tensions, the three men continued to work together and were the key architects of New Labour, the rebranding aimed at making the party electable.</p>\n    <p>In 1997 their work paid off, and following the landslide victory, Mandelson was given the job of minister without portfolio and then trade secretary.</p>\n    <p>The archetypal spin doctor, his reputation as a behind-the scenes fixer, schemer and schmoozer earned him the nickname, \"the Prince of Darkness\".</p>\n    <p>In 1998, he was forced into the first of his government resignations when it was revealed he had received a secret loan of £373,000 from his ministerial colleague Geoffrey Robinson.</p>\n    <p>Less than a year later he was back in government taking on the position of Northern Ireland secretary.</p>\n    <p>He lasted in that job until January 2001, when he quit over allegations of misconduct over a passport application for the Hinduja brothers. An inquiry later cleared him of wrongdoing.</p>\n    <p>His indignation at being booted out came boiling over later that year when he held onto his constituency seat of Hartlepool, despite challenges from left-wing candidates.</p>\n    <p>In an extraordinary and emotional victory speech, he said: \"It was said that I was facing political ruin. My career in tatters, apparently never to be part of the political living again.</p>\n    <p>\"Well, they underestimated Hartlepool. And they underestimated me. Because I am fighter and not a quitter!\"</p>\n    <p>Two years later he quit as an MP to become the EU's trade commissioner.</p>\n    <p>When Brown became prime minister in 2007, another comeback in British politics for Mandelson looked unlikely.</p>\n    <p>But in a shock move, a beleaguered Brown, suffering low polling ratings, appeared to bury the hatchet and appointed his former friend as business secretary, making him a peer at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was tasked with reinvigorating the government, which appeared to have run out of steam after a decade in power.</p>\n    <p>While many Labour backbenchers and members acknowledged Mandelson's presentational skill and strategic nous, they held him responsible for ditching some of the party's key socialist principles.</p>\n    <p>He was held in such suspicion, that Tony Blair once said the New Labour project would only be complete when party members had \"learnt to love Peter Mandelson\".</p>\n    <p>Mandelson himself said that was setting the bar too high. However, he seemed to have succeeded at the 2009 Labour Party conference when Mandelson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8279705.stm\">delivered a rousing speech</a> to despondent delegates, telling them: \"If I can come back, we can come back.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/977a/live/79e0ac10-8efe-11f0-ad1d-477615c292d0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Donald Trump shakes hands with Mandelson in the Oval Office. \"/>\n    <p>After Labour lost power, Mandelson started international lobbying firm, Global Counsel, where he was able to continue amassing influential contacts in business and politics.</p>\n    <p>These contacts, along with his ability to charm (he was nicknamed \"silver tongue\" by US President George W Bush), were among the reasons he was considered a strong candidate when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was looking for a new ambassador in Washington.</p>\n    <p>He had holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and made connections with Mark Burnett, the TV producer of the Apprentice, the show that sparked Trump's rise to power.</p>\n    <p>However, one of these connections has led to his downfall - his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, which continued after the American financier had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson had been widely-considered to have performed well in his first months as ambassador, but following the public release of his embarrassing correspondence with Epstein - and the threat of more to come - No 10 has decided to jettison him.</p>\n    <p>Throughout his career, Mandelson's ability to hob-nob with the rich and powerful has been an asset but has repeatedly got him into trouble.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, a friend of Mandelson told the BBC: \"He has weaknesses. He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"</p>\n    <p>Former MP Ben Bradshaw, who was in the cabinet with Mandelson, likened him to \"a sort of Icarus type figure\".</p>\n    <p>\"He's proved himself to be extremely effective in a number of jobs but at times he's flown too close to the sun,\" he told the BBC's World at One.</p>\n    <p>At the age of 71, having been forced out of office three times across four decades, it could be that this fall really does mark the last chapter in Peter Mandelson's extraordinary career.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4q61y399xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

I mention this mistake because it testifies to something powerful about Patrick Ryan's new novel, <i>Buckeye</i>.</p><p>When I made a late request for an advance review copy of <i>Buckeye,</i> the copy I received looked fine, but when I opened it I realized it was mistakenly bound backwards. The title page was at the very end of this over-450-page novel. </p><p>So, as a kind of brain exercise, I began reading<i> Buckeye</i> backwards, my head moving from right to left. By page 9, I was already so caught up in the world Ryan creates, <i>Buckeye</i> could have been misprinted upside down and sideways and I still wouldn't have been able to put it down.</p><h4>Author Interviews</h4><h2>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h2><h4>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h4><p>As its title indicates, <i>Buckeye</i> is set in Ohio, in a fictional small town called Bonhomie. The story, which focuses on two married couples, stretches from pre-World War II to the close of the 20th century. Margaret Salt is married to Felix — a closeted gay man who kind of, maybe, harbors the unarticulated hope that marriage might render his same sex desires dormant. </p><p>When the novel opens, Margaret, who's a red-headed, green-eyed \"looker,\" walks into the town hardware store where Cal Jenkins works and demands that he turn on the radio. There's commotion on the streets outside and, especially since her husband, Felix, is serving in the Navy, Margaret wants to know what's happening. It turns out that Germany has just surrendered to the Allies. Hearing the news, Margaret grabs Cal by his shoulders and kisses him. And Cal — a good husband and new father — likes it.</p><p>From that impulsive moment all sorts of complications and secrets sprout. While this teaser of a plot summary may make <i>Buckeye</i> seem like the stuff of vintage soap operas, the atmosphere of this novel is wry and contemplative rather than melodramatic. Ryan — whose previous books include the standout 2016 short story collection, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/485842485/the-dream-life-of-astronauts-is-a-journey-to-emotional-deep-space\"> The Dream Life of Astronauts</a>, as well as three YA novels — ambitiously aims here to write an American epic and he has the chops to do so. Ryan's omniscient narrator takes turns experiencing events from the four main characters' points of view, always subtly underscoring how contingency shapes our lives.</p><p>Cal, for instance, was born with one leg two inches shorter than the other — two inches that would keep him out of World War II and put him in Margaret's path. Cal's wife, Becky, discovered in childhood that she has the ability to communicate with the dead — a gift that will prove to be a grim comfort during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Chapters roam fluidly here from flashbacks to Margaret's tough start in life in an orphanage to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/01/14/462923148/herman-wouk-says-hes-a-happy-gent-at-100\">Herman Wouk</a>-like section chronicling the torpedoing of that cargo ship Felix is serving on. Felix meets the love of his life on that ship, a fellow sailor who quotes St. Thomas Aquinas to him, saying: \"The things that we love tell us what we are.\" The decades-long aftermath of silent grief that Felix must endure after the loss of that relationship is the anguished emotional core of this novel.</p><p>What Ryan captures in <i>Buckeye</i> is both the sweep of history and the mostly mundane particularity of everyday life. If there's a flaw to find in this overwhelming novel it may be that the characters are a bit too uniformly eloquent and self-aware. But, really, why complain about too many epiphanies when they're expressed as beautifully as this? I leave you with our narrator describing Felix in old age realizing something about time:</p><blockquote><p>What is it about time that confounds us? We spend it. We save it. We while it away. We waste it. We kill it. ... We regret what we’ve done with it. We give it away. We want it back. ... Felix saw it so clearly: all we should ever want of time is more of it. Life was so simple when it was reduced to the barest of necessities: more time; more air; more Duke Ellington.</p></blockquote></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5535609/buckeye-patrick-ryan-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And so that was probably an extra factor in my being drawn to this book,\" he said.</p>\n    <h3>Henry Huggins' moral dilemma</h3>\n    <p>For Dirda, the ending of the book was a revelation.</p>\n    <p>In the last chapter of the first<i> Henry Huggins</i> (spoiler alert if you haven't read it!), an older boy comes looking for Henry after seeing a picture of him and Ribsy in the local paper. When he sees the dog, he shouts \"Dizzy!\" The dog jumps up on the boy, licks his hands and wags his tail.</p>\n    <p>Cleary writes: \"A terrible thought came to Henry. Ribsy must have belonged to the boy before he found him in the drugstore over a year ago.\"</p>\n    <p>Both boys claim ownership of the dog and tell of how much they care for him. The kids decide to have a contest to let Ribsy choose who gets to keep him.</p>\n    <p>Each boy stands \"twenty squares down the sidewalk in opposite directions\" of the dog. On \"Go,\" the older boy yells \"Here Dizzy!\" while Henry yells \"Here Ribsy!\" The tension builds as Ribsy seems torn, wagging his tail when he looks back and forth at both boys. Ultimately, he walks toward Henry.</p>\n    <p>\"I was glad Henry got to keep his dog,\" Dirda remembers. \"But then I thought, 'The other guy, he loved the dog, too. And is it right that Henry should take his dog?'\"</p>\n    <p>Dirda has written about how Henry Huggins was the first book that forced him to confront a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-henry-huggins-and-lolita-can-teach-us-about-tolerance--and-civil-discourse/2019/12/30/b7862014-2b30-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html\">moral dilemma</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"All these things ran through my head as a kid. And it was at that point that I started to recognize that books were not simple stories with all these Disney kind of happy endings where everything works out perfectly for everybody and everyone is happy,\" said Dirda.

He's cast as \"Second Indian\" in a school play: He wears a robe and a feather from his mother's duster and says \"Ugh!\" In another book, his mother pretends to be afraid of him when he's dressed up as an Indian for Halloween.</p>\n    <p>Debbie Reese, who writes the blog <a href=\"https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2023/02/stereotypes-in-beverly-clearys-henry.html\">American Indians In Children's Literature</a>, says that while she understands why <i>Henry Huggins</i> is popular, she worries that white kids might \"read right through that problematic content … and not recognize it as harmful or a misrepresentation.\"</p>\n    <p>But Reese says the offensive text shouldn't be excised. She advises educators and parents to make it a teachable moment and tell kids: \"Oh, here's a mistake. That's not true. Native people didn't do this or they didn't look like that. I would like them to take it head on and say that it's a mistake.\"</p>\n    <p>Reese wants young readers and their families to know that \"books are not sacred. They are just someone's words, someone's stories.

Her dark brown hair is in a bob and she is smiling, wearing mulberry lipstick. Sheis wearing a black jacket and an indigo top with a silver chain link necklace.\"/>\n    <p>The ripple effects of the Angela Rayner saga roll on.</p>\n    <p>A cacophony of Labour voices now, via an official party process, are offering their views in public about whether the government is any good or not.</p>\n    <p>You don't need to be steeped in political strategy to grasp why some in and around Downing Street could really have done without this and want it all over as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>So far, we have seen a limited amount of the contenders: the Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson gave a speech to trades unionists at the TUC Congress in Brighton, in which she made no reference to the contest at all.</p>\n    <p>The left winger Bell Ribeiro-Addy has done some interviews with journalists and Alison McGovern has popped up on Newsnight.</p>\n    <p>Some of the others I have spoken to will be out and about before long, but are focused for now on touring the tearooms and attempting to fill their spreadsheets with the names of supporters.</p>\n    <p>Time is tight and the bar is high – cobbling together 80 people willing to back you in a handful of days isn't easy.</p>\n    <p>Already, though, we have had an insight into how awkward this race could prove for the government, depending on who makes it through the early stages.</p>\n    <p>Take Emily Thornberry. She served in Sir Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet before the general election and expected to be offered a cabinet job in his government after Labour had won.</p>\n    <p>No such offer came.</p>\n    <p>Now she is running to be deputy leader of the party. It is a story line with a certain soap opera appeal.</p>\n    <p>And already Thornberry has been punchily critical of the government, in just one post on social media.</p>\n    <p>\"We've made mistakes and must listen. Welfare. Gaza. Wealth tax,\" she wrote, adding, archly that she wouldn't \"just nod along,\" a line seemingly aimed at Phillipson and Alison McGovern, the other candidate who is also a government minister.</p>\n    <p>Imagine Labour's deputy leader, were Thornberry to win, spending the autumn talking up a wealth tax, in the weeks before the Budget in November.</p>\n    <p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, she has a lot of MPs to find to back her.</p>\n    <p>Attempting to do that, and in just a few days, led Ribeiro-Addy to publicly complain about the process being anti democratic.</p>\n    <p>She has also criticised the government for not scrapping the two-child benefit cap, she wants a full arms embargo and sanctions to be imposed on Israel, and the ban on Palestine Action to be removed.</p>\n    <p>Of course, hers is a campaign that may only last a few days. Let's see.</p>\n    <p>So, how many of the candidates are serious contenders here, and who are they?</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson is well on the way to 80 MPs backing her already, with 44.</p>\n    <p>Lucy Powell isn't far behind with 35.</p>\n    <p>The others are all in single figures.</p>\n    <p>But hundreds of Labour MPs are yet to endorse anyone.</p>\n    <p>The key question now is which candidates clear this first hurdle, and how many of them are not in government and so more free to criticise it as the race heads to its next stage?</p>\n    <p>This is likely to be a key factor in shaping the tenor and tone of the debate that follows – and the eventual winner.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

That's not so clear.</p>\n    <p>At the weekend John Healey, the defence secretary, said the government was looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels.</p>\n    <p>That was in the works before the reshuffle. It may be that Mahmood seeks to accelerate the timetable for closing hotels.</p>\n    <p>Sir Keir has said that he wants to close them all before the next general election though he alluded in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live last week to bringing that deadline forward.</p>\n    <p>Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from which both Reform UK and increasingly the Conservatives say the UK must withdraw to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was looking at ways to change UK law to make clearer to judges here the way in which the government believes the convention should be interpreted.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood may want to go further but it is hard to see how that would be possible given Lord Hermer, who remains in post as attorney general, not to mention the prime minister himself, are both ardently opposed to withdrawal.</p>\n    <p>We may not need to wait long to find out what Mahmood's new direction will be. Only a week after taking office as justice secretary last year, she announced plans to release thousands of prisoners earlier than planned to avoid what she called \"total collapse\" of the prison system.</p>\n    <p>Her handling of prison overcrowding, especially her willingness to grasp the nettle so early on, has been frequently compared favourably by Labour MPs to other cabinet ministers who were seen as taking too long to work out how they wanted to deal with their portfolios.</p>\n    <p>One ally of Mahmood told the BBC: \"She knows that time is of the essence. She didn't take long to take big decisions at the Ministry of Justice, and she doesn't tend to hang about.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95ec/live/97747df0-8ca2-11f0-a721-a79c3c3eadc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Shabana Mahmood visits HMP Bedford, alongside the prison's governor, Sarah Bott. The pair walk along a while corridor and in the background there is a prison officer holding open a white gate.\"/>\n    <p>One of the biggest changes might come in rhetoric and communication style.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was shadow home secretary for seven years in two stints and also spent five years as chairwoman of the home affairs select committee. Some in Labour pushing for a harder line on immigration occasionally complained that her deep knowledge of the issues involved made her public comments too nuanced to embody public dissatisfaction.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is likely to go another way.</p>\n    <p>That was definitely the sense from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7xyn03yno\">her first brief interview in the role</a> on Monday, in which she repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration, suggested she could withdraw visas from countries that do not \"play ball\" on migrant returns and embraced the potential introduction of ID cards  - all in clear, plain language.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood, 44, has been an MP for 15 years representing a constituency in Birmingham, but it is only in the past two years that she has moved into front-line, high-profile roles.</p>\n    <p>After spending her first five years in Parliament in a range of junior shadow ministerial portfolios, she co-chaired Cooper's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 2015. She then refused to serve under Jeremy Corbyn, instead dedicating her time during his leadership to fighting those on Labour's left-wing from a position on Labour's national executive committee, to which she was elected by Labour MPs.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, at the lowest ebb of Sir Keir's leadership, she was brought into the shadow cabinet to take charge of Labour's election campaign infrastructure. Even in that job, though, she was pushing her party to get over what she called its \"queasiness\" about talking tough on immigration.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/shabana-mahmood-the-woman-behind-labours-election-campaign-pk5vx3bn3\">In an interview with the Times in 2023</a>, she said: \"In the commentariat, among very politically engaged people, there's a sort of assumption about who is motivated by immigration as an electoral issue. </p>\n    <p>\"My constituency experience is that, actually, that's not got very much to do with race. I represent a very diverse constituency that's 70% non-white, and immigration comes up as an issue that my voters who are black or Asian and from other ethnic minorities want to talk about.\"</p>\n    <p>That is an argument you can be sure she will be making as home secretary in the coming weeks.</p>\n    <p>Whether she can address those concerns will determine not just her political fortunes but those of this government and prime minister too.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

She seems to be everywhere you turn in Birmingham, popping up on three panels, including two appearances on the main stage.</p>\n    <p>A lawyer and former prosecutor, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK in June, she says she entered politics to improve outcomes for the victims of crime.</p>\n    <p>A Conservative supporter since a teenager, Cunningham says she was a \"huge fan\" of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n    <p>\"But the Tory party changed,\" she says, accusing the Conservatives of failures over home ownership, taxation and crime over many years.</p>\n    <p>She has been tipped to be Reform's candidate for the London mayoral election in 2028, although she's coy about that prospect and stresses the party hasn't even started the selection process yet.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll help the party in any way they need me,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Atkinson is the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council - another name party bosses have high hopes for.</p>\n    <p>A self-taught engineer who set up a business that makes school furniture, Atkinson rose through the ranks of local politics with the Conservative Party in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>Then the Brexit years came, and like an increasing number of Reform UK's new joiners, Atkinson quit the Conservatives after becoming disillusioned with the party.</p>\n    <p>Since becoming council leader in Lancashire in May, Atkinson says he has focused on the \"huge financial challenges\" facing his Reform UK administration, alongside bread-and-butter issues such as fixing potholes.</p>\n    <p>In the future, he says, it would be a \"great honour\" to be a parliamentary candidate for the party where he lives in the Ribble Valley, if he was selected.</p>\n    <p>\"But that's a decision for other people,\" he adds.</p>\n    <p>If Reform does manage to get into government, and four years out from a general election it is still a very big \"if\", some of the party's would-be MPs may find fewer opportunities to rise to the highest levels of politics.</p>\n    <p>Farage and Zia Yusuf, the party's new head of policy, have talked about appointing dozens of new peers to take up roles in a Reform UK cabinet.</p>\n    <p>Could former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries - unveiled this week to much fanfare as Reform UK's latest Tory defector - be drafted into the Lords?</p>\n    <p>Former Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry was also doing the media rounds in Birmingham, and was seen walking into Friday night's afterparty in the main hall, where US pop legends the Jacksons made a surprise appearance on stage.</p>\n    <p>Like one of the back-up singers, Berry may be one of those called upon to make up the numbers in one of the many elections Reform UK wants to win.</p>\n    <p>In his conference speech, Farage said the party was taking the London mayoral election \"seriously\", as well as polls in Wales and Scotland next year.</p>\n    <p>He said Reform needed 5,000 vetted candidates to fight those polls, which he called \"an essential building block as we head towards a general election\".</p>\n    <p>As he closed the Birmingham conference, he called for volunteers in the audience to get to their feet if they wanted to stand in next year's elections.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the people's army in operation,\" Farage said.</p>\n    <p>In a symbolic gesture, some in the audience did stand, but the actual process for selection is designed to be far more rigorous.</p>\n    <p>Candidate selection has always been a thorny issue for Farage's various electoral vehicles, with election campaigns blown off course by scandals.</p>\n    <p>Party insiders like to describe Reform's rapid expansion - while ensuring candidates are properly vetted - as being like assembling a jumbo jet while flying it.</p>\n    <p>They insist they have improved their vetting system since last year's general election, after some candidates were ditched or suspended over offensive comments on social media ahead of the general election.</p>\n    <p>The party now has assessment centres, where candidates are put through their paces, and a centre for excellence, where activists are caught how to campaign effectively.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1182/live/c3cf4aa0-8b1d-11f0-b7cb-a948b12ba583.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Stephen Atkinson, the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council\"/>\n    <p>Thomas Kerr, the former group leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy48p5132qno\">defected to Reform in January</a>, was also doing the rounds of the fringe panels in Birmingham, and says he hopes to stand in next year's Holyrood elections.</p>\n    <p>Asked if Reform UK is one-man band, Kerr says: \"I don't think that if Farage was to fall under a bus that Reform wouldn't be polling where we are, because of the momentum behind the party.\"</p>\n    <p>Is the party getting more recognisable spokespeople though?</p>\n    <p>\"I think they are slowly starting to do that,\" Kerr says.</p>\n    <p>\"You see people like me and others appearing on panels at fringe events at conferences. You'll be seeing people speaking at conferences.</p>\n    <p>\"We are four years from a general election, Nigel is the man we are hoping will be prime minister but there will be a team behind him.\"</p>\n    <p>And with that, Kerr is interrupted by a Tannoy announcement that \"Nigel Farage will be on the main stage at 1pm\", and a mad rush to the main stage ensues.</p>\n    <p>Minutes before, Farage told his team he had wanted to rip up the conference schedule and deliver his main speech early, to react to Angela Rayner resigning as deputy prime minister and other roles.</p>\n    <p>Reform UK's new faces do their best to put themselves in the frame.</p>\n    <p>But for now, this is a picture that's very much dominated by one big figure.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl1k744548o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025.</p>\n<p>The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style.</p>\n<p>And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times.</p>\n<p>These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping \"How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy\" was a joke.</p>\n<p>And what was planned as No 10's \"get back in charge week\" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jl43400jo\">not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax</a> on her expensive new house.</p>\n<p>Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team.</p>\n<p>The start of this political season has been wild.</p>\n<p>In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut.</p>\n<p>The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken.</p>\n<p>Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed.</p>\n<p>There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake.</p>\n<p>It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster.</p>\n<p>It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis.</p>\n<p>She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called \"Mr Rules\" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, <i>ahem</i>, flexible attitude to the normal rules.</p>\n<p>She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust.</p>\n<p>For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the \"service of the people\", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels.</p>\n<p>For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, \"it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight\".</p>\n<p>And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world.</p>\n<p>\"There's just the smell test,\" a Labour insider said.</p>\n<p>This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not.</p>\n<p>Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now.</p>\n<p>The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument.</p>\n<p>Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust.</p>\n<p>Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0veg88g7jyo\">Making changes to his ministers.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making.</p>\n<p>Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: \"None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership.\"</p>\n<p>You and I might translate that as: \"The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway.\"</p>\n<p>One insider described it as moving those who were \"a bit awkward, or a bit tired\".</p>\n<p>What those changes add up to depends on who you ask.</p>\n<p>One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle \"is all about immigration\", believing \"Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this\" to solve the small boats issue or \"we're all done for\".</p>\n<p>Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings.</p>\n<p>But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper.</p>\n<p>Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't bet we'll see her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr68vde7nvo\">meeting JD Vance in waders</a> any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that.</p>\n<p>Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry.</p>\n<p>He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical.</p>\n<p>But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves.</p>\n<p>This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition.</p>\n<p>His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the \"time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long\", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck.</p>\n<p>Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: \"I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions.\"</p>\n<p>This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for.</p>\n<p>\"Phase 2\" was meant to be \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". Another bout of political jargon that followed, \"change\", \"renewal\", \"security\", \"fairness\", \"milestones\", \"first steps\", you get the point.</p>\n<p>Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing.</p>\n<p>\"You can see the problem from Mars,\" another party insider says, \"there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything\", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week.</p>\n<p>But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work.</p>\n<p>And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39rk4jlpw7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Angela Rayner has resigned as deputy prime minister, housing secretary and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, after admitting <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c0lk8ye1979t\">she underpaid tax after buying a flat in Hove</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is her resignation letter in full, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's response and a letter from Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial ethics, in which he sets out that Rayner breached the ministerial code.</p>\n<h2>Rayner's resignation letter</h2>\n<p>Dear Keir,</p>\n<p>Thank you for the personal and public support you have shown me in recent days. As you know, on Wednesday I referred myself to your Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to conduct a thorough investigation into my personal financial circumstances after I became aware that it is likely I inadvertently paid the incorrect rate for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).</p>\n<p>I have always taken my responsibilities as Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as a Member of Parliament with the utmost seriousness. I have long believed that people who serve the British public in government must always observe the highest standards, and while the Independent Adviser has concluded that I acted in good faith and with honesty and integrity throughout, I accept that I did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.</p>\n<p>I deeply regret my decision to not seek additional specialist tax advice given both my position as Housing Secretary and my complex family arrangements. I take full responsibility for this error. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount.</p>\n<p>I must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family. While I rightly expect proper scrutiny on me and my life, my family did not choose to have their private lives interrogated and exposed so publicly. I have been clear throughout this process that my priority has, and always will be, protecting my children and the strain I am putting them under through staying in post has become unbearable.</p>\n<p>Given the findings, and the impact on my family, I have therefore decided to resign as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>\n<p>For a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport to serve as the highest level of government has been the honour of my life. The challenges of government are nothing compared to the challenge of putting food on the table and getting a roof over our head when I brought up kids working as a home help. Too many people face the same across our country.</p>\n<p>I've always known that politics changes lives because it changed mine. The last Labour government gave me the tools I needed to build a better life for me and my young son, and that's why I've been working relentlessly from day one in government to do the same for the next generation. Every day I had in office, I worked to serve working class communities like the one that I grew up in, which are too often overlooked by those in power. I am proud that in every decision I made, I did it for them. I would never have become Deputy Prime Minister if not for the decisions taken by the last Labour Government, giving me a council house to support me, Sure Start to help raise my kids, and the security of a minimum wage - and I can only hope that the changes I made in government will have the same impact for young girls growing up on council estates like I did.</p>\n<p>Through my Employment Rights Bill people across the country will receive the biggest uplift in workers' rights in a generation. This landmark legislation will be game changing for millions of people stuck in insecure and low-paid work, giving them the dignity and security they don't just need but also deserve. I am and will remain deeply proud of that legacy. I am so proud to have worked alongside the trade union movement, who have given me everything, to deliver that.</p>\n<p>Our Renters' Rights Bill will finally ban the oppressive rule of no-fault evictions and will reset the balance between renters and landlords through ground breaking protection for renters. Everyone deserves to live in a safe and decent home, and I know this legislation will deliver that for millions of people across the country.</p>\n<p>The Planning and Infrastructure Bill will also be instrumental in getting the homes so many people across this country need built, and I am so proud that at the Spending Review we announced the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation with the overwhelming amount of this going to genuinely social rent homes.</p>\n<p>And last week, I introduced the English Devolution Bill to Parliament. The largest single package of devolution from any Westminster government to local people across England. This landmark legislation will permanently change the balance of power, giving true control to those with skin in game. We delivered an Elections Strategy which will mean 16 and 17 year olds getting the vote for the first time, as well as ambitious plans to ensure the most marginalised communities are registered to vote. We took steps to stabilise the broken foundations of local government and deliver the first genuinely fair funding review and the first multi-year settlement for a decade.</p>\n<p>My department, through my excellent team of Ministers, has also provided the largest ever investment in homelessness prevention services to local authorities, to get Britain back on track to ending homelessness for good. We've worked relentlessly to bring an end to the building safety crisis and developed new measures to get peoples' homes fixed quicker and hold rogue freeholders to account. We've also worked to boost community cohesion, tackle hate crime and reset the relationship with faith communities.</p>\n<p>I have been lucky to work alongside the most talented group of Ministers who worked with dedication to deliver for working people. I thank Matthew Pennycook, Jim McMahon, Alex Norris, Wajid Khan and Sharon Taylor. I too am grateful to my brilliant parliamentary team, Harpreet Uppal, Mark Ferguson, and Gen Kitchen.</p>\n<p>For me, being in office is the chance to change the lives of the people I grew up alongside. I will do whatever I can to continue doing so.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your leadership and for your friendship. I will continue to serve you, our country and the party and movement I love in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Rt. Hon. Angela Rayner MP Representing Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Droylsden and Dukinfield Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government</p>\n<h2>Sir Keir's reply to Rayner</h2>\n<p>Dear Angela,</p>\n<p>Thank you for informing me of your decision to resign from the Government. I am very sad that your time as Deputy prime Minister, Secretary of State and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party has ended in this way.</p>\n<p>As you know we acted in accordance with the strengthened system relating to ministerial conduct that we put in place on coming into Government. You were right to refer yourself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards and right to act on his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Although I believe you have reached the right decision, it is a decision which I know is very painful for you. You have given your all to making the Labour Government a success and you have been a central part of our plan to make Britain fairer for working families. Your work at MHCLG to help build the homes that Britain needs has been hugely important and your work to create more fairness in the workplace through the Employment Rights Bill represents a very significant achievement that will change the lives of millions of people.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I am very sad to be losing you from the Government. You have been a trusted colleague and a true friend for many years. I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievement in politics. I know that many people of all political persuasions admire that someone as talented as you is the living embodiment of social mobility.</p>\n<p>Even though you won't be part of the Government, you will remain a major figure in our party. I know that you will continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about.</p>\n<p>My very best wishes, and with real sadness,</p>\n<p>Keir</p>\n<h2>Ethics adviser's letter to PM on Rayner's conduct</h2>\n<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>\n<p>Following a self-referral by The Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 3 September 2025, I have undertaken an examination of the circumstances and facts connected to recent allegations about Ms Rayner's property ownership and tax affairs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyn051990o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I remember, at 10, my mum being suicidal and me sleeping like a dog on the end of her bed, just to try and stay next to her so she didn't do any harm to herself,\" Rayner said.</p>\n    <p>She has also recalled going to her grandmother's flat on Sundays, so the family could take it in turns to have a bath there. Hot water was too expensive for them to use at home.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0b5/live/55dde2b0-8a35-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner speaks at a general election campaign event in Manchester on 7 November 2019. She holds her hands out in front of a red screen.\"/>\n    <p>Rayner has often spoken about being told she would \"never amount to anything\", after she left school without any qualifications.</p>\n    <p>But after having her first child at 16, Rayner studied part-time at college, learning British sign language and gaining a vocational qualification in social care.</p>\n    <p>She spent a number of years as a care worker in Stockport, mainly looking after elderly people in their own homes, while also rising quickly through the ranks of the union, Unison.</p>\n    <p>She has described herself as \"mouthy\", someone who would \"take no messing from management\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c7a/live/27e0a200-8a38-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Alamy Angela Rayner with members of Unison and protesters from Save Our Ambulance Service on their way to the Department of Health. They hold a purple sign reading Unison.\"/>\n    <p>In her 20s, she became a full-time union official and eventually, after battles over working conditions and zero-hour contracts, rose to the most senior elected role in Unison in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>It was at Unison she met Mark Rayner, a fellow union official whom she married in 2010 and divorced in 2023. The couple went on to have two sons, one of whom was born so prematurely he is registered blind and has special educational needs.</p>\n    <p>At the age of 37, the mum-of-three became a grandmother, sparking the nickname \"Grangela\".</p>\n    <p>She credits the trade union movement with encouraging her to enter politics and taking her from - in her own words - \"the girl on a council estate\" to \"a woman who feels like she can conquer the world\".</p>\n    <p>Those ambitions started to be realised in 2015, when she was elected as the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne - a seat not far from her hometown. She later said she had only stood to make the point that \"people like me can't get elected\" and had \"accidentally\" won the seat.</p>\n    <h2>The Prescott role</h2>\n    <p>Rayner rose quickly in Westminster, taking up the women and equalities, and education briefs in the shadow cabinet of former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n    <p>When Corbyn stood down in 2020, following Labour's worst general election result since 1935, Rayner did not run for the leadership, and backed her ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second to Sir Keir.</p>\n    <p>Instead, Rayner stood for the deputy leadership and won election to that post comfortably - going on to be a central figure in Sir Keir's bid to remake the party.</p>\n    <p>But relations between Sir Keir and Rayner have sometimes been tense. After Labour lost control of eight English councils and lost the seat of Hartlepool in a parliamentary by-election in May 2021, the deputy leader was removed from her post as party chairwoman.</p>\n    <p>She pushed back and was appointed shadow first secretary of state among other titles.</p>\n    <p>By that point, Rayner had a strong support base and a powerful role likened to that of John Prescott, who was seen as a political bridge between the working class and the New Labour project during Tony Blair's premiership.</p>\n    <p>Rayner heavily leaned into that role and tried to use it to her party's advantage in the years before Labour's general election win in 2024.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58ff/live/0a856a50-8a39-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chairwoman of the Labour Party visit Seaton Carew seafront on 1 May 2021 in Seaton Carew. Sir Keir is in the foreground with his hands in his pockets, with Rayner behind him. A camera shoots a photo, with the beach behind them.\"/>\n    <p>Outspoken and combative at times, Rayner repeatedly accused the Conservatives of being \"out of touch\", and hammered the party with lines such as \"one rule for them and another rule for us\" during the scandal over pandemic parties in Downing Street.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Rayner admitted she had gone too far, once apologising for describing senior Conservatives as \"a bunch of scum\".</p>\n    <p>Her prominence and the venom of her political attacks had put a target on her back and attracted unwanted headlines.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, Rayner lashed out at \"sexism and misogyny\" in politics, after a newspaper reported that she crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson.</p>\n    <p>And in 2024, she was investigated by the police over the tax paid on the sale of her council house, again following a slew of reports by unfriendly newspapers, cheered on by the Conservatives. She was not found to have committed a criminal offence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0417/live/05a68220-8a3a-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party speaks on the final day of the Labour Party Conference on 28 September 2022 in Liverpool. \"/>\n    <p>Her tendency to brush through political controversies gave her an air of untouchability, with some dubbing her \"Teflon Ang\".</p>\n    <p>Her stock had risen further still as deputy prime minister, leading on one of Labour's key pledges to build 1.5 million homes by 2030, and helping Sir Keir quell a rebellion by Labour MPs over welfare cuts.</p>\n    <p>But the political optics of a housing secretary admitting she had not paid enough tax on her home were not easy on the eye.</p>\n    <p>Rayner faced charges of hypocrisy and calls for her to stand down.</p>\n    <p>She resigned from government after the prime minister's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus declared that she had breached the ministerial code.</p>\n    <p>While he said that Rayner had \"acted with integrity\", he told the prime minister that \"she cannot be considered to have met the 'highest possible standards of proper conduct' as envisaged by the [ministerial] code.\"</p>\n    <p>In her resignation letter, Rayner said she deeply regretted her decision not to seek additional specialist tax advice when buying a flat in Hove, East Sussex.</p>\n    <p>In his handwritten response, the prime minister said he had \"huge respect\" for her achievements in politics, describing her as \"the living embodiment of social mobility\".</p>\n    <p>Losing a key figure blows a massive hole in Sir Keir's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce93k7l0zpro\">plan to relaunch the government after a difficult first 14 months in office</a>.</p>\n    <p>It also marks the downfall of the career of one of Labour's brightest stars.</p>\n    <p>Having overcome a difficult upbringing and personal adversity to climb the heights of the Labour Party and become only its second ever deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner's political career has come to a premature end.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlz3p0ryylo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On 3 October 2021, Reform UK held its first conference - a modest one-day get-together in Manchester - only a short distance from the much larger Conservative Party gathering, taking place nearby at the city's Convention Complex at the same time.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At the Reform event, only a few hundred activists were present in the function room - and Nigel Farage, not yet party leader, was reportedly not among them. Reform was polling around 3% and had won just two councillors in that May's local elections.</p>\n<p>What a difference four years makes.</p>\n<p>Reform's annual conference takes place this weekend in Birmingham, with 5,500 tickets reportedly already sold. It is thought that one in five of the nation's lobbyists will be there too. The party has now been ahead in the polls for five months.</p>\n<p>Never before has a party other than Conservative or Labour been ahead in the polls for so long. Indeed, since the party's success in English local elections in May, it has consistently been averaging 30% to 31%, enough to put it well ahead of all its rivals.</p>\n<p>Recent attempts by YouGov and More in Common to estimate what the party's support might mean in terms of MPs suggest that if an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority. At the moment, Nigel Farage - now firmly in place as Reform's leader - appears potentially on course to become the UK's next prime minister.</p>\n<p>The question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?</p>\n<p>The next general election could be almost four years away. Much could happen between now and then. A year into the last parliament the Conservatives were narrowly ahead in the polls – only to crash to a heavy defeat in last summer's election.</p>\n<p>But what could make a difference – one way or the other – to Reform's prospects? Analysis of who is - and who is not - backing the party, and why, provides us with vital clues.</p>\n<p>So too does an understanding of the broader UK political landscape, one in which a fragmentation of the vote away from the main parties is offering Reform an unprecedented opportunity.</p>\n<h2>A plague on both their houses?</h2>\n<p>Support for Reform might be thought to be simply a protest vote by an electorate fed up with slow growth, an ailing health service, and high levels of immigration. If so, the party's popularity would seem likely to wane should the country's prospects look brighter in four years.</p>\n<p>Dissatisfaction with the state of the country certainly underpins support for Reform. For example, according to Ipsos, 68% of voters feel that the economy will get worse over the next year, up from 43% at the time of last year's election and as high as it has ever been a year into a new Parliament. Among those whose current party preference is Reform, a remarkable 89% are pessimistic about the prospects for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the most recent British Social Attitudes survey, conducted last autumn, showed that a record 59% are dissatisfied with the NHS. Among those who voted Reform last year, the figure is even higher – 69%.</p>\n<p>Most voters think that immigration is too high. An Opinium poll in August found that 71% feel that way. But nearly everyone who is now backing Reform (97%) expresses that view.</p>\n<p>Reform supporters have little confidence in the ability of either Labour's leader, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, or the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to address these issues. Most lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to handle the economy, the NHS, and immigration. However, at the same time, on balance their judgement of Badenoch's abilities is a negative one too.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Reform supporters have even less confidence than Conservative supporters in Sir Keir's abilities. At the same time, Reform supporters have less confidence than Labour supporters in Badenoch's capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, 58% of Conservatives lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to turn the economy around – well short of the 76% of Reform supporters who express that view. Meanwhile, 40% of Labour supporters doubt that Badenoch can tackle the economy, less than the 47% figure among Reform supporters.</p>\n<h2>A powerful magnet</h2>\n<p>Reform supporters seem to have lost faith in the ability of either of Britain's two traditional governing parties to address the country's most pressing problems.</p>\n<p>In contrast, they do have confidence in Farage. This is especially so for immigration, but he also scores well on the economy and the NHS.</p>\n<p>Among those currently backing Reform, 84% approve of the job Farage is doing – far higher than the equivalent figure for Sir Keir among Labour supporters (62%) or Badenoch (46%) among Conservatives.</p>\n<p>While Farage is not so widely admired in the wider population, his ratings among voters in general still compare favourably with those of his rivals.</p>\n<p>In Opinium's most recent poll, for example, rather more say they disapprove (40%) than approve (30%) of how Farage is handling his job as Reform leader. But that still means that more approve of the job he is doing than approve of Sir Keir (21%) or Badenoch (16%).</p>\n<p>The Reform leader is proving a powerful magnet that is attracting discontented voters into his party's camp.</p>\n<p>The party's future prospects seemingly rest heavily on Farage remaining its leader. The party might struggle to keep its support if Farage departed the political scene. At the same time, voters might drift away if the country's prospects improve under Labour or if Badenoch can persuade them that she and her party have better solutions than Farage.</p>\n<h2>The Brexit factor</h2>\n<p>Politicians do not talk much about Brexit these days. Yet, Brexit is a major fault line that sharply distinguishes those who do and do not support Reform. The party's support stands at no less than 53% among those who voted Leave in 2016. In contrast, just 11% of those who backed Remain are to be found in the ranks of current Reform supporters.</p>\n<p>But to misquote a former prime minister, Brexit means more than Brexit. Those who voted Leave in 2016 have distinctive views on a range of so-called cultural issues.</p>\n<p>They are especially concerned about immigration, they are doubtful about many equalities policies, and they are more inclined to be sceptical about climate change.</p>\n<p>These views are widely prevalent among those currently inclined to vote for Reform but are often out of kilter with the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>According to the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 81% of those who voted Reform last year believe that migrants have undermined rather than enriched the country's culture. Equally 73% feel that migrants have been bad for the country's economy. These figures are very different from those among voters in general, just 31% of whom believe that migration has undermined Britain's culture, and only 32% feel it has been bad for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 53% of Reform voters believe that attempts to give equal opportunities for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals have \"gone too far\". Some 49% say the same of equal opportunities for black and Asian people, while 71% express that view in the case of transgender people. The equivalent figures among the general public are 33%, 18% and 50% respectively.</p>\n<p>Only 33% of Reform voters believe that climate change is being caused mainly by human activity, far fewer than the 54% figure among the public in general. As many as 25% state that the climate is largely changing as a result of natural processes, a view shared by just 8% of all voters. Reform voters are less supportive than other voters of virtually any measure designed to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Opposition to immigration, equal opportunities policies, and climate change measures feature prominently in Reform's campaigning – which often cites spending on these issues as alleged examples of government waste. Indeed, Reform voters are noticeably less keen on government spending too. Only one in four (25%) believe taxes should be increased in order to spend more on \"health, education and social benefits\", much lower than the 46% of all voters who take that view.</p>\n<p>The party is singing a tune that is widely popular among the many Brexiteers who have been recruited into the ranks of its supporters.</p>\n<p>Doing so has enabled the party to capture much of the coalition of Leave voters that gave Boris Johnson his mandate in 2019 to deliver Brexit. The Conservatives lost one in four of their 2019 supporters to Reform at the last election - and now, on top of that, Badenoch's party has lost another three in 10 of those who were still loyal to the Conservatives last year. In total, that means half of those who voted for Johnson in 2019 are now backing Farage.</p>\n<p>Consequently, support for the Conservatives among 2016 Leave voters (23%) is only a little higher now than among Remain supporters (14%). In 2019, 75% of Leave voters (and just 20% of Remainers) backed Johnson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy853rj2kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.</p>\n    <p>She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8%, down.</p>\n    <p>Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.</p>\n    <p>Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.</p>\n    <p>She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics.</p>\n    <p>It's going to be a rough ride to 26 November.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>One of the major reasons why Britain's prime minister Sir Keir Starmer - following France and then in turn followed by Canada - has a plan to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September is to turn the two-state solution into a real diplomatic plan again, instead of the empty slogan it has become since the Oslo peace process collapsed into bloodshed 25 years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>A day driving around the West Bank is a salutary reminder of how facts created by Israel to stop that happening have been concreted into the rocky hills and valleys the Palestinians want for a state.</p>\n<p>The success of the huge national project that Israel started days after it captured the territory in the 1967 Middle East war can be seen in Jewish settlements that now are home to more than 700,000 Israelis.</p>\n<p>Getting them there is a project that has taken almost 60 years, billions of dollars, and drawn condemnation from friends as well as enemies. It is a violation of international law for an occupier to settle its citizens on the land it has taken.</p>\n<p>Last year, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory that said the entire occupation was illegal.</p>\n<p>But the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is hungry for more settlements.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, the defence minister Israel Katz and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that 22 new settlements would be built in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Katz said the massive expansion, the biggest in decades, was making a \"strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel and serves as a buffer against our enemies\" .</p>\n<p>\"This is a Zionist, security, and national response - and a clear decision on the future of the country,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Next to Katz was the ultra-nationalist leader Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a settlement in the West Bank and believes that the land was given to the Jews by God. He is finance minister but also is effectively the governor of the West Bank with sweeping powers over planning.</p>\n<p>Smotrich called the settlement expansion a \"once-in-a-generation decision\" and declared: \"Next step sovereignty!\"</p>\n<p>Everyone in Israel, and the Palestinians in the territories, know that when Smotrich and his allies say \"sovereignty\" they mean annexation.</p>\n<p>Smotrich wants all the land for Jews and has openly discussed finding ways of removing Palestinians.</p>\n<h2>'We were very, very scared'</h2>\n<p>On hilltop after hilltop in the West Bank are settlements at different stages of their development, from well-established small towns with mature gardens and schools, to outposts with handful of caravans and a militant population of young settlers who often mix religion with extreme Jewish nationalism, firearms and sometimes deadly aggression towards their Palestinian neighbours.</p>\n<p>Statistics collected by the UN and peace campaigners show that violent settlers have increased attacks on their Palestinian neighbours since the 7 October attacks.</p>\n<p>I went to see how that has affected Taybeh, an entirely Christian village of around 1,500 people.</p>\n<p>It is a quiet place that seems to have many more houses than residents. After nearly six hard decades of Israeli occupation, more Taybeh people have been forced to emigrate than now live in the village.</p>\n<p>Two nights before the visit, settlers entered the village when most people were in bed. They burned Kamal Tayea's car and tried unsuccessfully to get into his new house, part of a pleasant development overlooking acres of olive groves. They daubed the walls with graffiti in Hebrew sprayed with red paint.</p>\n<p>Kamal, a middle-aged man reassessing whether his decision to move his family to the edge of the village was wise, is installing a network of security cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We were very, very scared,\" Kamal said. \"I have children and an old mum. Our lives were threatened, and it was terrifying.\"</p>\n<p>I asked him whether Britain's plan to recognise Palestine would make his life any easier.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so. It's a big step to have a superpower like Britain support us, but on the ground, it does not change much. Israel is not compliant with any international resolutions or laws.</p>\n<p>\"It does not listen to any other country in the whole world.\"</p>\n<h2>'Our roots are here. We can't move'</h2>\n<p>During the next night, Jewish settlers raided neighbouring Palestinian communities, burning cars and spraying graffiti. It is more than just vandalism.</p>\n<p>The settlers want the Palestinians out and, in some places in the occupied territories, have succeeded, forcing Palestinians in remote villages out of their farms and stealing their livestock.</p>\n<p>The Greek Orthodox priest, 74-year-old David Khoury was born in Taybeh. In his church he told me that settlers who have threatened him and other residents are often armed.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, they have guns… they'll use them if we argue with them. They want us out, they want us to leave.\"</p>\n<p>The old priest was defiant.</p>\n<p>\"We are here, since Jesus Christ, 2,000 years. Our roots are here. We can't move. We will not move, even if we die here, we will not move from here… Palestine is inside our blood, how we can live without our blood?\"</p>\n<h2>'If you really seek two states, recognise [both]'</h2>\n<p>It was not many miles to Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank, but I wasn't able to get there in person. Israel's checkpoints can make driving back to Jerusalem slow and difficult, so I reached Husam Zomlot via Zoom. He is the head of the Palestinian delegation to the United Kingdom, effectively their ambassador in London. He is back home for the summer and was delighted by Britain's plan to recognise Palestine.</p>\n<p>\"It is a sign that the UK and with it, the rest of the international community are really serious about the two-state solution. We are no longer in the business of the lip service that has lost us three decades. Actually, if you really seek two states, recognise the two states.\"</p>\n<p>\"We see the recognition as the starting gun to a sprint towards implementing and establishing the state of Palestine and fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\"</p>\n<p>Zomlot was jubilant. It was, he said, a first step, and Britain's decision would make a real difference.</p>\n<p>History is one of the powerful drivers of this conflict. Britain, he added, was atoning at last for the wrongs it had done Palestinians when it was the imperial power here between 1917 and 1948.</p>\n<p>He was referring to the promises made in a short, typewritten letter, dated 2 November 1917, signed by the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of Britain's Jewish community. It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p>\n<p>Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p>\n<p>It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p>\n<p>He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p>\n<p>At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p>\n<p>At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p>\n<p>Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East. He is not in a position to punish us, and it definitely will not bring peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"And it's against justice, history, religion, culture... he's giving a huge reward for Yahya Sinwar [the Hamas leader who led the 7 October attacks and was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year].</p>\n<p>\"Wherever he is in hell today, he sees what Keir Starmer says - and says, 'good partner'.\"</p>\n<p>Back in Taybeh, I had asked a group of leading local citizens who were drinking coffee with the mayor in his office what they thought of the UK's recognition plan.</p>\n<p>One of them, a local businessman, said: \"Thank you Britain. But it's too late.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Top image: Getty Images</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6n0eeqp54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Who is in charge? You might think the answer should be obvious.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\"This government should be walking on water, there should be nothing it can't do,\" a Whitehall insider suggests, given the rows and rows and rows - and yes, rows - of Labour MPs who line up behind the prime minister every Wednesday.</p>\n<p>But, by booting out a small band of backbenchers this week, Sir Keir Starmer's put the question of his authority back on the table.</p>\n<p>Answering the question of who is in charge isn't so simple after all.</p>\n<p>This government has a \"backbench they - and we - are surprised to discover they can't control,\" says one senior official.</p>\n<p>The financial markets are breathing down its neck, with the country's debts sky high, and for good measure, what a No 10 source describes as a \"deep current of instability\" around the world.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's next one-to-one meeting with President Donald Trump is a case in point – who knows what he will or won't say alongside the prime minister on Scottish soil next week?</p>\n<p>No-one in government can be sure how that is going to shake down, although I was very definitively told we will not be seeing Sir Keir swinging a club with his transatlantic pal.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, impossible for any administration to be the master of all it surveys. But convincingly displaying authority, inhabiting its power, is a different task.</p>\n<p>And neither all of Sir Keir's MPs, nor all of the people inside the government are sure it's being met.</p>\n<h2>Backbench bust-ups</h2>\n<p>Let's start with the prime minister kicking out four MPs this week after they had objected to various Labour plans and proposals.</p>\n<p>But if Sir Keir really felt in control of his party, why did he need to bother about a group of MPs that wouldn't even fill a family saloon? And why did he do it, just days before accepting some of the logic of one of those he kicked out, Chris Hinchliff, over tweaks to proposed planning laws?</p>\n<p>Bemused? You wouldn't be the only one.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's allies say he always believed there would have to be repercussions for MPs who plot against the government repeatedly, in part because others are asked to defend decisions that might be unpopular or difficult.</p>\n<p>So after the welfare fiasco, the whips were asked to make a list of those who had been actively trying to organise resistance to government plans, rather than just expressing objections.</p>\n<p>After gathering evidence about MPs' behaviour, those four were then shown the door, at least for now, to exert discipline over the backbenches.</p>\n<p>A senior government figure said: \"You can have as big a majority as you want, but if you have no discipline whatsoever it can get chaotic. You can't get chaotic at a time when the country desperately needs its government to get on with things.\"</p>\n<p>It was a separate decision to suspend Diane Abbott - again, a choice made by Labour HQ who felt it had no choice but to act, interpreting her comments as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwye24vjnn8o\">repeating a claim that Jewish people don't experience racism in the same way as black people.</a></p>\n<p>So, \"behave - or else\", is the message to the rest of the backbenches, just when they are about to leave Westminster.</p>\n<p>But have the moves this week made a difference? One senior MP said: \"A lot of people keep wondering, 'Is Keir beholden to his back benches?' I don't think people are like, 'Oh we're going to rebel if we're unhappy all the time'. But there has to be more respect for MPs who are actually out talking to their constituents.\"</p>\n<p>Another senior Labour figure told me, \"No 10 was completely spooked by what happened over welfare – I don't think backbenchers are running it, but they do have a taste for power.\"</p>\n<h2>Are ministers the masters?</h2>\n<p>Who then, is really in charge, I ask a member of the government. They laugh, and say, \"I don't have an answer\".</p>\n<p>The same question posed to another Whitehall figure: \"There is no way of knowing,\" they respond, suggesting sometimes government, even 12 months in, feels chaotic, with contradictory instructions to officials being given, even on the same day.</p>\n<p>It's no secret, and it's not surprising, that working out how to run a country when you haven't done it before is hard.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of ministers and staffers who will of course say loyally that No 10 is now firmly in control after understandable teething troubles, who are also somewhat fed up with the noises off.</p>\n<p>As one government source reckons, \"a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss\". Another insider believes Whitehall is working much better than before. \"In the first six months they were disappointed in us, and we were disappointed with them\".</p>\n<p>The Spending Review process occupied huge amounts of time and effort across government. Now that is over, it's not just the government's purse strings that have been set, but the political priorities alongside. In theory, as that source suggests, \"they are now starting to get on with the doing\".</p>\n<p>But that optimism is not springing from every source.</p>\n<p>One experienced senior official told me: \"A government is in charge if it has a plan, but if it doesn't, it cedes that. They still don't really have a governing plan, so it feels like the PM is in charge, but it is hard for his writ to be made to work.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, it's clearer now, particularly after the big review of spending, what the government wants to do, but not how they plan to do it.</p>\n<p>Another senior figure said: \"They're busy and exhausted going to meetings with each other, and producing documents that no-one ever reads, and conversations that don't lead to anything and telling each other how difficult it is – they don't inhabit their power.\"</p>\n<p>And there's obvious frustration among the government's own members too, one warning of a passive attitude among some colleagues, who could get to the next election and think only, \"Well, I enjoyed driving around in my ministerial car and having my red box\". There is a feeling, like, \"Oh, we are here just to manage, not to lead and drive, and that's not good enough\".</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, one cabinet minister defended the operation, \"It's only been a year, people focus on the problems, if you look at it in the round we have been very, very effective,\" they told me.</p>\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0mn7gmpplo#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20the%20Off%20Air%20with%20Laura%20K%20newsletter%20to%20get%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%27s%20expert%20insight%20and%20insider%20stories%20every%20week%2C%20emailed%20directly%20to%20you.\">Off Air with Laura K</a> newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n<p>Governments are, of course, never short on helpful advice. As well as No 10's own learning on the job, and plans to improve its operations, like a review of communications across government that is under way, there will be other more formal suggestions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Later in the summer a set of proposals will be published by a think-tank with close links to No 10 and Labour, the Future Governance Forum, that's chaired by the former senior civil servant, Helen MacNamara.</p>\n<p>The review will recommend a new government department, called \"Downing Street\", to give this and future prime ministers a more powerful centre of government so that No 10 can make decisions more quickly, and execute its plans more effectively.</p>\n<p>Government insiders may not have appetite for any big bang changes, although they have pledged themselves on many occasions to \"rewire\" the government.</p>\n<p>The respected Institute for Government already warned this week that big changes were needed if \"ministers were serious\" about their promise to rewire the state, concluding in its own research that Sir Keir's notion of \"mission driven government\" looks \"shaky\", and that government departments had reverted to old habits.</p>\n<p>Moving desks and chairs around Whitehall, whether creating new departments or axing the old, wouldn't exactly make the pulse of the public quicken, but perhaps it ought to be on the agenda for a government that has struggled sometimes to exert its will.</p>\n<h2>The mighty markets</h2>\n<p>If ministers' grip isn't as tight as it might be, and backbenchers aren't calling the shots, there is no doubt there's another huge controlling factor.</p>\n<p>A senior Labour source tells me, \"People like to boil this down to palace politics,\" the jockeying for power between politicians, or the competing beliefs inside the party.</p>\n<p>Surely not, Westminster enjoying a soap opera about the battle for the party's soul?</p>\n<p>But instead they argue, \"The markets are fundamentally a really major part of it – the government isn't making challenging decisions because it enjoys annoying people, or making life hard\".</p>\n<p>It's true the fights inside and outside the government are so often driven by cash sloshing around or falling down the back of the sofa.</p>\n<p>Spoiler, overall spending is enormous but Rachel Reeves keeps a very tight grip on her wallet.</p>\n<p>By instinct, Labour politicians normally want public spending to be generous.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxwe3g4wl5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kelly said: \"They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive.\"</p>\n    <p>Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round.</p>\n    <p>\"If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,\" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though \"a lot of bad things are said about him\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f0d/live/393463b0-58f2-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.png.webp\" alt=\"Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer  &#10;\"/>\n    <p>But Sodiq said: \"I'm at the other end of the scale. He's a politician, like others, who says things people want to hear, and people generally are not comfortable with the two main parties, and just want to try something else.\"</p>\n    <p>Labour is worried by their grisly position in the polls, and there's something of a sense of bewilderment too about just how shaky things have got in the last few weeks.</p>\n    <p>But at senior levels, sources believe if they keep on keeping on, eventually, many voters like those we met this weekend will return to them if hopes for improvements in the NHS and the economy come to pass.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/820b8f00-4c22-11f0-a466-d54f65b60deb.png.webp\" alt=\"Laura K newsletter banner\"/>\n    <p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/z3qtg2p\">Off Air with Laura K </a>newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac63/live/8c7c22b0-4c22-11f0-8c47-237c2e4015f5.png.webp\" alt=\"Grey presentational line\"/>\n    <p>Watch tomorrow to hear the advice that our group would give Sir Keir Starmer in order to improve, to make that happen.</p>\n    <p>Of course this is only a taste of what's on some voter's minds in just two constituencies, but the mood was certainly disappointed with what has, and has not happened since Labour moved back into power.

But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194318-02-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.\"/>\n    <h2>Rising pressure</h2>\n    <p>\n            The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/kevin-mccarthy-taiwan-president-meeting-china/index.html\">announced</a> earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication<strong> </strong>amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\">suspected Chinese surveillance balloon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/us-sanctions-chips-china-xi-tech-ambitions-intl-hnk/index.html\">semiconductor supply chains</a> – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n    </p>\n    <p>Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.</p>\n    <p>But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.</p>\n    <p>For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.</p>\n    <p>China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.</p>\n    <p>The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”</p>\n    <p>It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.</p>\n    <p>While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.</p>\n    <p>Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.</p>\n    <p>Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.</p>\n    <p>Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194350-03-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency.\"/>\n    <h2>Beijing watching</h2>\n    <p>A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>\n            Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-public-opinion-military-response-pelosi-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric</a> in mainland China. \n    </p>\n    <p>This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.</p>\n    <p>But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.</p>\n    <p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.</p>\n    <p>\n            It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/asia/taiwan-former-president-ma-visit-china-intl-hnk/index.html\">Ma Ying-jeou</a>, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n    </p>\n    <p>Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.</p>\n    <p>\n            China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/china/taiwan-ukraine-parallels-china-russia-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">global spotlight</a> following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Beijing has recently sought to position itself as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/china/china-position-political-settlement-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">an agent of peace</a> in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n    </p>\n    <p>This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.</p>\n    <p>\n            An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/biden-xi-meeting-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/h_93dc31c74b4bfe3b5ab35a8c0bb23901\">face-to-face meeting</a> in Bali. \n    </p>\n    <p>“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p>\n    <p>“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220819143103-china-amb-nicholas-burns-vpx.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"China Amb Nicholas Burns vpx\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed reporting.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment. \n    </p>\n    <p>Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.</p>\n    <p>Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.</p>\n    <p>He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/victor-j-glover/biography\">Glover</a> is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/02/tech/nasa-spacex-astronauts-return-iss-highlights-scn/index.html\">piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft</a> and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n    </p>\n    <p>“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.</p>\n    <p>Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/christina-hammock-koch/biography/\">Koch</a>, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/world/nasa-all-female-spacewalk-koch-meir-scn-trnd/index.html\">first all-female spacewalk in 2019</a>. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\n    </p>\n    <h2>About this mission</h2>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/world/nasa-splashdown-artemis-i-orion-sunday-scn/index.html\">uncrewed test mission</a> that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120057-artemis-ii-crew-official-portrait.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The Artemis II lunar flyby mission crew members include (from left): NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman (foreground) and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\"/>\n    <p>If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n    <p>The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.</p>\n    <p>The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.</p>\n    <p>After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n    <p>Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/world/nasa-spacesuits-moon-artemis-unveil-scn/index.html\">spacesuits</a> for walking on the moon and a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/business/spacex-static-fire-starship-super-heavy-scn/index.html\">lunar lander</a> to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            NASA is targeting a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis-iii/\">2025 launch date</a> for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf\">2026 or later</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.</p>\n    <h2>Picking the astronauts</h2>\n    <p>\n            Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/world/nasa-artemis-moon-secretive-crew-selection-process/index.html\">selection process</a>. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/astronaut-right-stuff-apollo-11-trnd-scn/index.html\">inaugural missions</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.</p>\n    <p>“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”</p>\n    <p>She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”</p>\n    <p>“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.</p>\n    <p>\n  <i>CNN’s Kristin Fisher contributed to this story.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.\n    </p>\n    <p>Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.</p>\n    <p>The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.</p>\n    <p>This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.</p>\n    <p>\n            Inflation in the United Kingdom also <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/22/economy/inflation-uk-surprise-rise-february/index.html\">jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February</a>, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The pound turnaround</h2>\n    <p>The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.</p>\n    <p>The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.</p>\n    <p>“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.</p>\n    <p>But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.</p>\n    <p>“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.</p>\n    <p>The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.</p>\n    <p>Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.</p>\n    <p>A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.</p>\n    <p>Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.</p>\n    <p>“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.</p>\n    <p>Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.</p>\n    <p>A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”</p>\n    <p>\n            The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/spy-balloon-technology/index.html\">officials have said</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-balloon-tracking-method/index.html\">developed a method of tracking</a> what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n    </p>\n    <p>The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.</p>\n    <p>\n            CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-spy-balloon-collected-intelligence-us-military-bases-rcna77155\">first to report</a> on the new intelligence.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/politics/china-spy-balloon-us-latest/index.html\">eventually shot down</a> by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n    </p>\n    <p>A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”</p>\n    <p>Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”</p>\n    <p>The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/politics/us-tracking-china-spy-balloon/index.html\">reported</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>This story has been updated with additional reporting.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.</p>\n    <p>Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.</p>\n    <p>Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>\n            France is currently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/europe/france-pension-reform-protests-biarritz-airport-intl/index.html\">in the throes of a political and social crisis</a> triggered by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/macron-france-pension-no-confidence-intl/index.html\">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.</p>\n    <p>French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.</p>\n    <p>“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”</p>\n    <p>French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”</p>\n    <p>“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
