    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Tory MP and shadow minister Danny Kruger defects to Reform</h1>\n    <p>Conservative MP Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>Kruger has been an MP since 2019, and sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister.</p>\n    <p>\"The Conservatives are over,\" he told a press conference, sitting alongside Reform party leader Nigel Farage.</p>\n    <p>Kruger said he had been \"honoured\" to be asked to help Reform prepare for government, and said he hoped that Farage would be the next prime minister.</p>\n    <p>The East Wiltshire MP - who has said he would not be triggering a by-election - said the Conservatives were no longer the main party of opposition.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"There have been moments when I have been very proud to belong to the Tory party\", but added: \"The rule of our time in office was failure.</p>\n    <p>\"Bigger government, social decline, lower wages, higher taxes and less of what ordinary people actually wanted.\"</p>\n    <p>He added: \"This is my tragic conclusion, the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the left.\"</p>\n    <p>Although he said he had \"great regard\" for Badenoch, he said the Tory party had a \"toxic brand\", adding: \"We have had a year of stasis and drift and the sham unity that comes from not doing anything bold or difficult or controversial.\"</p>\n    <p>Describing his move leaving a party he has been a member of for 20 years as \"personally painful\", he said his \"mission\" with Reform would be to \"not just to overthrow the current system, it is to restore the system we need\".</p>\n    <p>Responding to the news of the defection, Badenoch said: \"Danny has made his case very clear, that this is not about me.</p>\n    <p>\"I can't be distracted by that, and I'm not going to get blown off course by these sort of incidents.</p>\n    <p>\"I know this is the sort of thing that is going to happen while a party is changing. I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party remains \"the same party that failed the people in the last government\" and doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>His previous jobs include serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>Kruger spoke in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-62030114\">2022 Parliamentary debate</a> about the US's abortion ban and told MPs he disagreed that pregnant women had an \"absolute right to bodily autonomy\" and that he didn't understand why the UK was \"lecturing\" the US.</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and made comments about the role of conventional family values in society.</p>\n    <p>The evangelical Christian told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Rishi Sunak, the Conservative prime minister at the time, distanced himself from the remarks.</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the son of TV chef Prue Leith and an Old Etonian, who studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"It is getting to the point where the only difference between them is just a slightly lighter shade of blue.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

in Washington, DC on 26 February 2025.\"/>\n    <p>Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure from within the Labour party over his handling of the sacking of the US ambassador Peter Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership, as he prepares to welcome US President Donald Trump on a state visit this week.</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson was sacked last week after a cache of emails reported by Bloomberg showed supportive messages he sent after convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offences.</p>\n    <p>Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be \"gone\" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour.</p>\n    <p>The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's judgement and the wider Downing Street operation.</p>\n    <p>Burgon is a longstanding left-wing critic of Starmer's leadership but his comments nevertheless underline the scale of discontent within Labour.</p>\n    <p>Burgon said: \"I think it's inevitable that if May's elections go as people predict and the opinion polls predict, then I think Starmer will be gone at that time.</p>\n    <p>\"In terms of where we are now, it feels like we're years and years into an unpopular government rather than a year into a government that's just got rid of the Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>\"We're losing votes to the left, we're going to be losing seats to the right.\"</p>\n    <p>His words echoed a weekend of briefing by Labour MPs in public and in private questioning Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>Labour MP Helen Hayes told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour on Sunday that if the sacking were to affect the party's chances in the May 2026 local elections, there would be questions about Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>\"Questions about the nature of the leadership and whether things can continue as they are, but we're not at that point now,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Hayes added that she felt \"devastated\" about Lord Mandelson, but said she believed he should not have been appointed in the first place.</p>\n    <p>With Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month, Downing Street will be hoping to reset the agenda.</p>\n    <p>This week also marks the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgqe26jvnno\">first flight sending asylum seeker deportees to France</a> under the \"one-in-one-out\" deal signed in July.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street sources acknowledge that Sir Keir's upcoming Labour party conference speech must make an impact and say MPs would be \"left in no doubt what he stands for and what drives him\".</p>\n    <p>But this is the second week in a row the prime minister has begun by trying to draw a line under a scandal that led to a high profile exit, and move to a new chapter.</p>\n    <p>The mood in the parliamentary Labour party is bleak, and there are fears the past two weeks may have crystalised MPs' concerns.</p>\n    <p>Government minister Baroness Smith, who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, told the BBC in her experience \"there will always be people in the Labour party worried about us going further and faster\".</p>\n    <p>\"It is difficult at the moment given people's insecurity and concern sometimes for mainstream politicians to cut through.\"</p>\n    <p>She also hit back at Burgon's prediction that Sir Keir will be replaced next year, telling BBC Breakfast the backbencher had never supported the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>She admitted that the sacking of Lord Mandelson as the ambassador to the US was \"not what we would have wanted to happen in the run up to this week\", but said the PM was doing a good job.</p>\n    <p>The BBC reported on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82rdmzr20o\">Sir Keir explicitly asked Mandelson</a> about his links to the paedophile before deciding to appoint him as ambassador to the US.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives have demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment.</p>\n    <p>In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>He said that the scandal had exposed the PM's \"appalling judgement\".</p>\n    <p>\"He ignored warnings about Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, forced through his appointment, and is avoiding scrutiny about what he knew,\" Burghart wrote.</p>\n    <p>The Conservative MP's letter also demanded the release of what he called the \"Mandelson-Epstein Files\" - government correspondence and internal documents related to the pair - and for Sir Keir and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney to give evidence to Parliament.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street have already stressed that the prime minister only knew the contents of the emails on Wednesday evening and acted swiftly, sacking Mandelson within hours.</p>\n    <p>Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has warned Sir Keir's leadership is \"hanging by a thread\" and demanded the prime minister explain Mandelson's appointment in parliament.</p>\n    <p>Labour is facing a polling challenge from Reform UK, as leader Nigel Farage claimed Sir Keir's judgement had left him \"ever more distanced\" from Labour's roots.</p>\n    <graphic

    "body": "<p>Many truly great works of art over the years have been shot in one take - from World War One epic 1917 to the Spice Girls' music video for Wannabe.</p>\n<p>But a lot of the most famous examples - including that 90s girlband masterpiece - weren't actually shot continuously in real life. They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been.</p>\n<p>One of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyxn4wqkq0o\">which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards,</a> was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption.</p>\n<p>It's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March.</p>\n<p>Audiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama.</p>\n<p>Its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world.</p>\n<p>The drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed.</p>\n<p>Cooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode.</p>\n<p>They find him in his bedroom and place him under arrest. \"You're making a big mistake,\" insists the boy's dad, played by Stephen Graham, who also co-created the series with writer Jack Thorne.</p>\n<p>But as the episode unfolds, it's clear there is no mistake. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately proves Jamie's guilt, and Adolescence begins to examine its key questions: what led to this murder, and what motive could a teenager possibly have had.</p>\n<p>It was a storyline based on real events. \"I read an article about a young boy who'd stabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Wcu3t4yOQbE?si=-lJLGBjecSfL-5RH&amp;t=104\">Graham told Radio X's Chris Moyles</a>.</p>\n<p>A similar but separate teen stabbing hit the headlines just a couple of months later. \"And these two incidents were at the opposite ends of the country,\" Graham noted.</p>\n<p>\"And I just thought, why is this happening? And not just because I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compass can look at that situation and think, what's going on with society today that we're in this era where these young boys are stabbing young girls to death?\"</p>\n<p>Graham knew the success of the show would hinge on the young actor chosen to play Jamie, and casting director Shaheen Baig struck gold with Cooper - who had first become interested in acting around the age of 10.</p>\n<p>In a joint interview with Baig, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/owen-cooper-shaheen-baig-adolescence\">Cooper explained:</a> \"I don't know where it came from, but I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer.</p>\n<p>\"I still play football now, and then asking them if I wanted to start drama lessons, it was a bit out of the blue, really.\"</p>\n<p>Baig recalled: \"It was really [about] trying to find somebody with the emotional register to be able to play Jamie.</p>\n<p>\"Owen sent us an improv tape, and I remember first watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart.\" It felt very natural.\"</p>\n<p>Many of the headlines surrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wasn't actually true.</p>\n<p>\"It has frustrated us a bit,\" said drama teacher Esther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting classes Cooper had attended for two years in Didsbury, Manchester.</p>\n<p>The Adolescence team, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp91yz4p44vo\">she told BBC News in April,</a> had approached the Drama MOB school while casting the series, asking to see tapes of their \"strongest northern boys\".</p>\n<p>\"They kept coming back for Owen,\" she recalled. \"He just had something.\"</p>\n<p>It was true that Cooper didn't have any TV or film credits to his name, but not that he had never tried his hand at acting.</p>\n<p>In fact, Morgan suggested Cooper's comfort with one-take shooting was partly due to the drama school's focus on improvisation.</p>\n<p>When the show launched, Morgan said: \"It felt amazing, but I didn't realise it would be as good as it was, I didn't expect it to be talked about so much.\"</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the series dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday).</p>\n<p>\"We wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament,\" <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/18/adolescence-writer-jack-thorne-incel-culture-netflix\">Thorne said.</a></p>\n<p>The government subsequently supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised.</p>\n<p>Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood\" <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2025/03/19/adolescence-review-it-will-chill-the-blood-of-any-parent-of/\">said the Telegraph's Anita Singh</a>. It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"</p>\n<p>Clearly, Emmy voters didn't forget about it either. The show's impact was so undeniable that it was seen as the dead-cert for best limited series.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd72d98gj58o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On a scorchingly hot day in the American Midwest, Tim Maxwell is voicing his fears about the future of farming.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects.</p>\n<p>\"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company.</p>\n<p>He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs.</p>\n<p>\"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\"</p>\n<p>His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops.</p>\n<p>American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July.</p>\n<p>With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening.</p>\n<p>Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis.</p>\n<p>Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular.</p>\n<p>Mr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\"</p>\n<p>So why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy?</p>\n<h2>Farmers on a 'trade and financial precipice'</h2>\n<p>If you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days.</p>\n<p>There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar.</p>\n<p>But when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine.</p>\n<p>\"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\"</p>\n<p>In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China.</p>\n<p>In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China.</p>\n<p>Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock.</p>\n<p>September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year.</p>\n<p>Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University.</p>\n<p>\"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\"</p>\n<p>The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser.</p>\n<p>Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States…</p>\n<p>\"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke.</p>\n<p>\"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\"</p>\n<p>American farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency.</p>\n<p>In a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\"</p>\n<h2>Trump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day'</h2>\n<p>Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjedvwed1xgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Yet in the midst of our grief, we have been deeply moved by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support.</p>\n    <p>\"Richard's memory will forever remain in our hearts, in the hearts of his fans, and in the sport he loved so dearly.\"</p>\n    <p>A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said \"there are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances\" surrounding Hatton's death.</p>\n    <p>Hatton, who won 45 of his 48 professional bouts during his 15-year career, was world champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, and last fought professionally in 2012.</p>\n    <p>\"Richard was so much more than a world champion. To us he was simply 'Richard', our son. A loving father, grandfather, and brother, and a true friend to many,\" the Hatton family added.</p>\n    <p>\"He inspired generations with his fighting spirit, his humility, and his love for the sport. But beyond the titles, the nights to remember, and the roar of the crowd, he remained the same down-to-earth Richard who never forgot where he came from.</p>\n    <p>\"It has been a source of great comfort to see just how many lives Richard touched, and how widely he was admired and respected.</p>\n    <p>\"At this time, we kindly ask for privacy as we come to terms with life without him. In the days and weeks ahead, we will take strength from one another and from the knowledge that Richard's legacy - both in boxing and as a man - will continue to live on.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published19 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published20 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published19 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Manchester to honour 'much loved' boxer properly - Burnham</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/819/cpsprodpb/df3d/live/50e36780-921e-11f0-8fd6-f3e5d0b160a2.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Hatton tries to avoid a punch from Floyd Mayweather\"/>\n    <p>Ricky Hatton (left) lost for the first time when he was beaten by Floyd Mayweather (right) in Las Vegas in 2007</p>\n    <p>Nicknamed 'the Hitman', his all-action style saw Hatton became one of Britain's most popular fighters, with a loyal following.</p>\n    <p>Those fans travelled in huge numbers to watch Hatton fight, with more than 30,000 heading to Las Vegas for his title bout with Floyd Mayweather in 2007.</p>\n    <p>Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham praised Hatton, who was a hugely popular figure in his home city.</p>\n    <p>\"Ricky was much loved by so many in Greater Manchester.

Here's how to fix it</h1>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7248/live/573bb830-8fcb-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"BBC Woman with hands on her head looking stressed\"/>\n    <p>When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks.</p>\n    <p>Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode.</p>\n    <p>This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness.</p>\n    <p>Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind.</p>\n    <p>Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze.</p>\n    <h2>1. Be kind to yourself</h2>\n    <p>Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping.</p>\n    <p>Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched.</p>\n    <p>Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it.</p>\n    <p>If you are concerned then you should contact your GP.</p>\n    <h2>2. Create routines</h2>\n    <p>Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory.</p>\n    <p>Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\"</p>\n    <p>It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making.</p>\n    <h2>3. Take breaks</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7672/live/5fead5c0-8f1b-11f0-8ce3-5fb6152ae494.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Person is organizing their work and personal agenda in a notebook at home, using sticky notes and colorful markers to plan their week, surrounded by envelopes, a smartphone, and a notepad \"/>\n    <p>It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room.</p>\n    <p>But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely.</p>\n    <p>Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly.</p>\n    <p>Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next.</p>\n    <h2>4. Use calendars and reminders</h2>\n    <p>Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness.</p>\n    <p>Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space.</p>\n    <p>Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores.</p>\n    <p>This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\"</p>\n    <h2>Swans</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/76e5/live/f7a2f920-8f1a-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman in a white top drinks water in a kitchen surrounded by fresh vegetables and a laptop\"/>\n    <p>Alongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen focus.</p>\n    <p>Each letter stands for a key habit that can help clear the mental mist and keep your mind performing at its best:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Sleep:</strong>Sleep is non-negotiable - it gives your brain time to rest and consolidate memories. Aim for between seven and nine hours each night.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Water:</strong>Our bodies are about 60% water and even mild dehydration can make you feel unfocused so keep water nearby and sip it regularly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Moving your body boosts blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps you think more clearly. Try going on short walks, a light jog or regularly stretching</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong>Nourish your brain with whole foods rather than processed ones. Choline is a nutrient vital for brain health so eating food that is rich in it like eggs, fish and nuts can support concentration and focus.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Stress:</strong>Chronic stress floods the body with cortisol - a hormone that helps regulate your body's response to stress - and that can cloud your thinking. Find ways to lower stress through breathing exercises, mindfulness and hobbies.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Use the <a href=\"https://www.newcastle-hospitals.nhs.uk/services/great-north-childrens-hospital/childrens-health-psychology/resources/managing-brain-fog/\">NHS website</a> to find out more about brain fog and how to manage it.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87ydw7xdxvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
