Currently trading at $24.50, the token faces a key resistance at $25.30, with a monthly close above this level set to mark its highest since October 2021.</p><p>The bullish momentum is supported by a long-standing technical structure. On the monthly chart, LINK has formed a massive cup-and-handle pattern stretching across 45 months, or roughly 1,370 days. The setup is nearing confirmation, with neckline resistance around $25.30. </p><figure><figcaption><em>LINK one-month chart.

At the same time, LINK has reclaimed a bullish position above both the 25-month and 50-month moving averages, reinforcing the positive trend.</p><p>The long-term price target for LINK could reach as high as $125, a potential 415% rally from current levels. Market analysts are also noting near-term targets. </p><p>Trader Javon Marks <a href=\"https://x.com/JavonTM1/status/1968693269073653958\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://x.com/JavonTM1/status/1968693269073653958\">highlight</a>s $47.15 as an immediate level of interest, suggesting the token could see a 90% move higher in the short run. Beyond that, Marks points to $88.26, which would represent gains of more than 255% from current prices.</p><figure><figcaption><em>LINK one-week analysis by Javon Marks.

Reduced supply on exchanges is often interpreted as a sign of declining sell pressure, potentially strengthening the upward rally.</p><figure><figcaption><em>LINK exchange reserves-all exchanges.

The initiative aims to streamline subscription, redemption, and settlement of tokenized products using Chainlink’s Digital Transfer Agent contracts. </p><p>With Hong Kong fostering innovation in RWA tokenization, the pilot underscores Chainlink’s role as a critical infrastructure for bridging traditional finance and blockchain.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Oracle market share dominance by Chainlink. Source: Token Metrics/X</em></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, Chainlink continues to dominate the oracle landscape. According to <a href=\"https://x.com/tokenmetricsinc/status/1964040867758723563\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://x.com/tokenmetricsinc/status/1964040867758723563\">Token Metrics</a>, Chainlink secures over 83% of Ethereum’s total value secured (TVS) and roughly 67–68% of the overall oracle market, safeguarding more than $93 billion in onchain value. </p><p>The network has enabled $25 trillion worth of transactions to date, supporting over 2,000 active data feeds, and operates CCIP across 60+ blockchains. Data streams throughput surged 777% in Q1 2025, reflecting accelerating adoption.</p><p>With 6% of LINK’s circulating supply staked and RWA tokenization gaining momentum, which is a $66 billion market, Chainlink’s utility fuels its current target of a possible $100 token value in the future. </p><p><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-investor-turns-1k-into-1m\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-investor-turns-1k-into-1m\"><em><strong>Related: ‘Diamond hand’ investor turns $1K into $1M as BNB tops $1,000</strong></em></a></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

According to Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr., market conditions are currently balanced and primed for a move higher.</p><p>Adler Jr. <a href=\"https://x.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1968644174099464325\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://x.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1968644174099464325\">highlights</a> that the Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV Z-Scores for both 155-day and 365-day cohorts are hovering near zero, indicating that the market is neither overheated nor oversold. With BTC trading just above the STH realized price, the setup suggests a one-to-two-week consolidation phase could precede a breakout. “Uptober incoming,” Adler Jr. noted, pointing to seasonal tailwinds.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Bitcoin short-term holder MVRV data.

Bitcoin futures are trading at a consistent premium to spot, with the seven-day basis running above the 30-day, a structure typically linked with bullish trends. However, Adler Jr. cautioned that minor overheating signals appeared ahead of the recent FOMC event, where cost basis rose on light volume, suggesting some late-stage positioning.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Bitcoin basis: futures to spot% %. Source: Axel Adler Jr./X</em></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the base case remains tilted toward strength. “There’s a 70% chance the next two weeks will see a stepwise uptrend or sideways consolidation,” Adler Jr. explained. </p><p>Meanwhile, institutional demand remains a firm anchor as US spot Bitcoin ETFs have <a href=\"https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/Total_Crypto_Spot_ETF_Fund_Flow?page=usBTC\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/Total_Crypto_Spot_ETF_Fund_Flow?page=usBTC\">attracted</a> $2.8 billion in net inflows since Sept. 9, pushing activity decisively into positive territory. With inflows supporting BTC price and technical indicators aligning, traders are bracing for what could be a defining stretch in Bitcoin’s next bullish leg. </p><figure><figcaption><em>US spot Bitcoin ETF flows data.

The steady rise has left behind pockets of internal liquidity, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback before continuation. September’s seasonality, historically leaning bearish, adds weight to this scenario.</p><p>That being said, Bitcoin’s broader behavior in 2025 has largely defied expectations for retracements. For much of the year, the asset has skipped over internal liquidity levels, instead moving between external liquidity zones, i.e., swing highs and lows on higher time frame charts over multiple weeks. A comparable move occurred in July, when BTC bypassed liquidity near $105,000 and quickly surged to new highs after confirming a daily break of structure (BOS).</p><figure><figcaption><em>Bitcoin one-day chart. Source: </em><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDT/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSDT/\"><em>Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A similar setup appears to be forming now. If Bitcoin secures a daily close above $117,500, it would confirm another BOS and sharply reduce the odds of a dip below $114,000. Such a development would also align with analyst Axel Adler Jr.’s projection of new all-time highs within the next two weeks.</p><p>While a narrow window remains for a retest of order blocks near $114,000–$113,000, improving macroeconomic conditions and accelerating ETF inflows suggest buyers may step in earlier, limiting downside opportunities. The balance between structural liquidity gaps and bullish momentum may decide whether Bitcoin pauses or breaks directly toward $124,000.</p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-yield-lacking-not-disadvantage-luke-gromen-analyst\" title=\"null\"><em><strong>Related: Knocking Bitcoin’s lack of yield shows your ‘Western financial privilege’</strong></em></a></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

While the US is just beginning its DePIN journey, thriving Web3 ecosystems elsewhere show their success hinges on regulatory clarity.</p><p>Dubai’s <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/cryptocurrency-regulation-in-the-uae-and-the-dubai-virtual-assets-law\" title=\"null\">Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA)</a>, established in 2022, creates specific sandboxes for Web3 infrastructure projects. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) actively supports tokenizing real-world assets through initiatives such as Project Guardian and the Singapore Blockchain Innovation Programme. </p><p>At the same time, the country’s fintech regulatory sandbox clearly defines the parameters for blockchain experimentation. </p><p>In South Korea, the telecommunications giant LG U+ has been <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/korean-mobile-carrier-lgu-launches-blockchain-based-overseas-payment-system\" title=\"null\">trialing a blockchain-based cross-border payment system</a> since 2018, a rollout that would have faced years of approval processes under the US Federal Communications Commission’s rules. The country saw a 15% year-on-year growth in the number of blockchain service providers in 2023. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/southeast-asia-to-drive-depin-growth-ama-recap-with-u2u-network\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/southeast-asia-to-drive-depin-growth-ama-recap-with-u2u-network\"><em><strong>Southeast Asia to drive DePIN growth</strong></em></a></p><p>Vietnam’s <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vietnam-national-blockchain-strategy-2025-vision-2030\" title=\"null\">national blockchain strategy</a>, launched in late 2024, explicitly provides legal clarity for blockchain applications in finance, logistics, agriculture and data management. The government is currently piloting its NDAChain platform, a national blockchain that aims to boost its e-government and digital economy with decentralized identification of citizens. </p><h2>Deeper pockets for DePIN projects</h2><p>While the Bay Area still captured 24% of the $368 billion in global venture capital funding in 2024, the real capital for blockchain is flowing elsewhere. </p><p>The UAE ranked third (the US comes fourth) on the Henley Crypto Adoption Index, which assesses cryptocurrency and blockchain integration across nations. With up to 7,100 new millionaires expected to flock to Dubai in 2025, the Gulf’s expat community — with its high disposable income and bullish attitudes toward emerging technologies like DePIN — continues to grow.</p><p>Abu Dhabi’s $500-million <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://pitchbook.com/profiles/fund/26340-22F\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">Digital Energy Infrastructure Fund</a> specifically targets “blockchain, DePIN, AI, cloud, and other compute cluster applications” in its investment thesis. The UAE is emerging as the leader in the Web3 space by putting firepower behind DePIN applications in sectors where traditional infrastructure has failed to keep pace with demand.</p><p>Singapore’s state funds, Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), have shifted their focus to blockchain infrastructure outside traditional tech hubs. In recent years, the GIC has invested $70 million in Hong Kong-based BC Group, parent company of crypto exchange OSL. </p><p>In comparison, Temasek led a $110-million funding round in Hong Kong-based <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-animoca-brands-hong-kong-stablecoin-license\" title=\"null\">Animoca Brands</a>, Asia’s most prominent blockchain investment firm. Sovereign wealth funds are strategizing for a future built on digital infrastructure. </p><h2>Building necessities over luxuries</h2><p>New York and Silicon Valley were once celebrated as the only places to meaningfully scale a Web3 product. Not anymore.</p><p>Though most of Helium’s 380,000 decentralized wireless hotspots still exist within the US, new deployments rapidly expand users’ coverage in Southeast Asia and South America. </p><p>During Helium pilots in Mexico, subscribers to telecommunications company Movistar averaged 390 megabytes, or seven hours of web browsing, of daily data on the Helium network, showing how DePIN can solve real connectivity challenges. </p><p>The message for DePIN builders and entrepreneurs is clear: Design for users who need your infrastructure, not those who might find it interesting in a Palo Alto coffee shop. For investors, the opportunity lies in identifying projects that solve real problems in markets with regulatory clarity and growing adoption. Policymakers can facilitate this with frameworks that accommodate new blockchain-based projects rather than trying to force them into existing, rigid categories.</p><p>Companies in Asia led the mobile revolution of the 2010s in response to losing their lead on desktop, creating giants like WeChat, Gojeck and Kakao, which now make those markets near-impossible for Silicon Valley to penetrate. Countries like the UAE, Vietnam and Singapore are now establishing a similar lead in this market long-term, and Web3 companies should pay attention to what this will mean in five to 10 years. </p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Yanal M.

    "body": "<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>\n<ul><li><p>ChatGPT accelerates crypto analysis by interpreting data, summarizing sentiment and creating strategy templates.</p></li><li><p>Traders use it for practical tasks like bot development, technical interpretation and backtesting simulations.</p></li><li><p>It augments — not replaces — human decisions and works best when combined with tools like TradingView.</p></li><li><p>Key limitations include inconsistent real-time data access and reliance on clear prompts and human oversight for accuracy.</p></li></ul>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market operates at a speed and scale that is impossible for any single human to fully comprehend. Every minute, thousands of data points are generated across news feeds, social media platforms, onchain metrics and technical charts. For the average modern trader, the primary challenge is no longer accessing information but processing it effectively to find a clear, actionable signal amid the deafening noise.</p>\n<p>This is the precise domain where artificial intelligence, specifically a large language model like ChatGPT, can be transformed from a novelty into an indispensable analytical co-pilot. This guide demonstrates how to systematically <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-analyze-crypto-market-movements\" title=\"null\">integrate ChatGPT into your trading workflow</a>. </p>\n<h2>What can ChatGPT do for traders?</h2>\n<p>Before we begin, it is critical to establish the ground rules of using ChatGPT for financial analysis. Ignoring these will lead to flawed conclusions and potential losses.</p>\n<ul><li><p>In its free public version, ChatGPT cannot connect directly to market data APIs. However, ChatGPT Plus and Pro users can access live internet browsing, which allows real-time updates such as the current price of Bitcoin or the latest news. Its core strength remains in analyzing and interpreting the data you provide.</p></li><li><p>The outputs from ChatGPT are not investment advice. It is a tool for <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-data-mining\" title=\"null\">data processing</a> and language interpretation. The responsibility for every financial decision remains entirely with you.</p></li><li><p>The utility of ChatGPT is 100% dependent on the quality, accuracy and timeliness of the information you feed it. Using flawed data will guarantee a flawed analysis.</p></li></ul>\n<h2>How to set up your ChatGPT-powered analysis toolkit</h2>\n<p>To use ChatGPT effectively, you must first become a proficient data gatherer. Your goal is to collect high-quality information from specialized platforms and then use ChatGPT as the central processor to connect the dots. A professional setup includes three key components:</p>\n<ol order=\"1\"><li><p><strong>Source of truth for price data:</strong> This is non-negotiable. A platform like TradingView is essential for real-time price action, volume data and an array of technical indicators.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trusted source for narratives:</strong> The crypto market is driven by stories and trends (narratives). Use trusted sources or specialized news terminals to stay informed about regulatory changes, technological upgrades and major partnerships.</p></li><li><p><strong>Source for fundamental data:</strong> For deeper analysis, tools like Glassnode, Nansen or Santiment provide invaluable insight into the underlying health of a network. This includes data on exchange inflows/outflows, whale wallet activity and network growth metrics, which can often lead to price action.</p></li></ol>\n<p>With these tools, you are equipped to feed ChatGPT the high-quality information it needs to produce a high-quality analysis.</p>\n<h2>A step-by-step guide to generating signals with ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>This methodical process guides you from a high-level market overview down to a specific, well-defined <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-trading-strategies\" title=\"null\">trading strategy</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Identify the macro market narrative</h3>\n<p>Crypto capital flows in waves, often chasing the most compelling current story. Is the market excited about AI-related tokens, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/asset-tokenization\" title=\"null\">real-world asset (RWA) tokenization</a> or the latest layer-2 scaling solution? Your first task is to use ChatGPT to identify these dominant narratives.</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Action:</strong> Go to your news aggregator. Collect the headlines and the first paragraph of the top 10-15 crypto market news stories from the past three to five days.</p></li><li><p><strong>The prompt:</strong>“Act as a cryptocurrency market analyst. I will provide you with a list of recent news headlines and summaries. Your task is to analyze this information and identify the top 2-3 dominant market narratives for August 2025. Categorize each narrative (e.g., ‘AI and Blockchain Integration,’ ‘Regulatory Developments,’ ‘DeFi 2.0,’ ‘Real World Asset Tokenization’). For each dominant narrative, explain why it appears to be gaining traction based on the provided text.”</p></li></ul>\n<p><strong>News items:</strong></p>\n<ol order=\"1\"><li><p>“BlackRock files for tokenized treasury bond fund, leveraging Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain settlement.”</p></li><li><p>“Helium Network’s 5G coverage surpasses 1,000 US cities, driving HNT token burn rate to new highs.”</p></li><li><p>“SEC chairman indicates a clearer path for tokenized securities, boosting confidence in the RWA sector.”</p></li><li><p>“IO.net announces major partnership with Render Network to pool GPU resources for AI startups.”</p></li><li><p>“JPMorgan Chase report highlights real-world asset tokenization as a potential $10-trillion market by 2030.”</p></li><li><p>“Filecoin sees surge in enterprise data storage contracts following network upgrade.”</p></li></ol>\n<p>This analysis provides a crucial filter. Instead of randomly scanning hundreds of coins, you now have a focused list of sectors where market attention and capital are currently flowing. If “AI and blockchain integration” is a hot narrative, your next steps will focus on assets within that category.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Measure market sentiment with ChatGPT</h3>\n<p>Once you have a narrative and a potential asset (e.g., Fetch.ai’s FET), your next step is to drill down and gauge the <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-chatgpt-and-grok-are-reshaping-crypto-analysis-beyond-technical-charts\" title=\"null\">real-time sentiment</a> surrounding it.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-real-time-crypto-trading-signals?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
