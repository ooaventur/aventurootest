    "body": "<p>When writer <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/author/jessica-phillips\">Jessica Phillips</a> visited Istanbul, the city was in a state of flux – yet she fell for its many layers of beauty, history and diverse culture</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#comments-area\">Comments</a>\n    </p>\n<p>I hadn’t tipped Montreal Shot Bar in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/turkey/istanbul-travel-guide-best-hotels-restaurants-things-to-do-b2087164.html\">Istanbul</a> as the place I’d learn the art of traditional Kurdish dance. But there I was, two Efes beers deep, hand in hand with a local waiter, trying not to out myself as what I am: a fully-fledged dancephobe.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances, I’m allergic to dancing. As a child, I’d run screaming from any kids' club that played the <i>Macarena</i> like it was an air raid siren; I never mastered the Cha Cha Slide or S Club 7 dance routines, and don’t get me started on Tube Girl. </p>\n<p>But this wasn’t London’s Be At One, this was a city on the precipice, where cultures collide, politics clash, and religions weave together. A place constantly straddling two worlds: the perfect arena in which to let my alter ego feel the wind in her hair, if only for a night.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read more:</strong>\n      <strong> Turkey's best-kept secret lies in its northeast playground of perfect snow</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>When I visited Istanbul at the end of April this year, it was in a state of turmoil, just after the mass protests following the arrest of the city’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu – at the time the primary opposition candidate to Turkey’s right-wing populist leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – and before hundreds more left-wing protestors were arrested during May Day demonstrations. The city had also just suffered a 6.2 magnitude earthquake.</p>\n<p>I was uneasy about visiting while the country was in a state of flux, but I wanted to see the city between the headlines. On my arrival, the only signs of aftershock – or the oncoming wave of unrest – was the visible police presence dotted around Taksim Square and on Istiklal Caddesi, one of the city’s most famous pedestrianised shopping streets. The city’s day-to-day rhythm remained unchanged: men drank Boza (a fermented high-protein drink made from grains) on the kerbside; imams from neighbouring mosques harmonised calls to prayer and street-smart teenagers watched football matches from public viewpoints overlooking Beşiktaş Stadium.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read more: </strong>\n      <strong>The resort town where you can find Maldives-like winter sun closer to home</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Like most first-time tourists to the city, I headed to Hagia Sofia – the Christian Orthodox Church turned mosque found in Sultanahmet Square (£20 for visitors or free for Muslims and Turkish citizens.) First consecrated in 360 CE, it was transformed into an Islamic place of worship after Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered the city formerly known as Constantinople in 1453. It became a museum in 1934 before being converted back into a mosque in 2020. Today, it’s designated a Unesco World Heritage Site and around 50,000 Christians, Muslims and nonbelievers alike pilgrimage to the site every day.</p>\n<p>I found it to be a beautiful confusion, with its famed domed roof sheltering murals of Christ poking out behind calligraphed panels inscribed with the Prophet Mohammed’s name. Though for me, it was the New Mosque, ironically built between 1597 and 1665, that had the real wow factor. Maybe it’s because it doesn’t attract the crowds of its sister site or because I'm a sucker for Iznik tiles, but it’s there, draped in a chador hastily bought at the local gift shop to hide my leopard print tunic and Celtic knees, that I felt I got a snapshot of the Istanbul of old.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Read more: </strong>\n      <strong>The best Turkey holiday destinations – and when to travel to each one</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I learned more about the city’s frenetic religious tapestry at Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Istanbul’s largest Catholic church. Most notably, it claims Pope John XXIII as its own, referring to him as “The Turkish Pope” because of his close relationship with this parish. When I stepped inside in the days following Pope Francis’ passing, Catholics lined up to write tributes in a book of remembrance; one, a teenager wearing a hoodie with the slogan “I haven’t lost my virginity because I don’t lose” on the back. Oddly, I think the late pontiff would have approved.</p>\n<p>To dig deeper into the city’s history, pre-hair transplant tourists (the follically-challenged flock to the country in their millions each year), I visited the Istanbul Archaeological Museums, three buildings made up of the Museum of the Ancient Orient, the Archaeology Museum and the Tiled Pavilion, which tell of Turkey’s history across different eras and empires. Highlights included the Ishtar gate of ancient Babylon, the Kadesh Treaty, which is widely considered to be the oldest peace treaty in the world, and its most well-known excavation, Alexander Sarcophagus, a stone coffin depicting Alexander the Great’s Persian conquests, which is in part still stained with its original red colour from the 4th-century BC.</p>\n<p>In terms of the city’s culinary and culture scene, a surprising amount of it takes place in former banks, which my guide Alim explains with a quip: “It wasn’t as if we were using them for anything else.” The old headquarters of Ottoman Bank is now home to a two <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/michelin\">Michelin</a>-starred restaurant, Neolokal, which boasts a traditional-meets-modern Anatolian menu of local and seasonal ingredients.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/turkey/istanbul/istanbul-city-break-b2829238.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And from wonderful wanders and outdoor adventures to timely traditions and experiences, there’s a huge amount to enjoy around Britain.</p>\n<p>What’s more, they’re all accessible by train, making it even easier to get away from it all, wherever you’re based. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.railcard.co.uk/?utm_source=Independent&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=railcard_summer_2025\">Railcard</a> offers a third off rail travel around Britain. With nine Railcards to choose from, saving customers an average of £172 a year, it pays for itself in no time. Find the one for you at <a href=\"https://www.railcard.co.uk/?utm_source=Independent&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=railcard_summer_2025\">railcard.co.uk</a>. Railcard has also created a handy <a href=\"https://www.railcard.co.uk/cheap-train-tickets/?utm_source=Independent&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=railcard_summer_2025\">online calculator</a> to determine how much you could save – simply enter your journey details and the relevant Railcard and it will calculate the discount you can get. Read on for a raft of autumnal activities, experiences and getaways perfect for the months ahead…</p>\n<h2>Explore historic houses and atmospheric castles</h2>\n<p>Many of Britain’s stately homes and historic castles look especially lovely at this time of year. Norfolk’s Felbrigg Hall (a 15 minute bus ride from Cromer station) has 380 acres of beech, oak, sweet chestnut, hawthorn and sycamore trees that transform into a riot of colour in the autumn months. Inside the house, the library contains over 5,000 books and is reportedly haunted by former owner William Windham III – who keeps watch over his collection. Essex’s Audley End House and Gardens (a 30 minute walk from Audley End station) also has glorious autumn colour as well as Halloween themed activities like spooky stories and ghost hunting lessons to keep the kids entertained in half-term. Caerphilly Castle (a ten minute walk from Caerphilly station) – the second largest castle in Britain after Windsor – reopened in the summer after a two year renovation and the autumn months are a suitably atmospheric time to visit, with <a href=\"https://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/caerphilly-castle\">2FOR1 tickets with National Rail</a>.</p>\n<p>Nearest station: Cromer, Audley End, Caerphilly</p>\n<h2>Cosy up in a pub</h2>\n<p>If summer was all about beer gardens, autumn is about snuggling down next to a log fire in a cosy pub. Pick a pub with rooms somewhere suitably scenic and you can make a weekend of it, working up a thirst (and appetite) with a long walk before retreating back indoors. <a href=\"https://www.ploughhathersage.com/\">The Plough</a> in Hathersage (a 10 minute walk from Hathersage station) dates back to the 16th century and claims to serve one of the best roast dinners in the Peak District.<a href=\"https://www.greyhoundaldbury.co.uk/\"> The Greyhound</a>, in the chocolate box village of Aldbury (one mile from Tring station) is full of nooks and crannies – and adjacent to the National Trust’s Ashridge Estate and The Ridgeway, making it ideal for a walking weekend. Charlbury’s<a href=\"https://www.thebellatcharlbury.com/\"> The Bell</a> (a ten minute walk from Charlbury station) puts you right in the heart of The Cotswolds and has twelve incredibly stylish rooms (some dog-friendly), while The Old Bridge Inn in Aviemore (a five minute walk from Aviemore station) sits on the banks of the River Spey in Scotland with The Cairngorms on your doorstep.</p>\n<p>Nearest station: Hathersage, Tring, Charlbury, Aviemore</p>\n<h2>Enjoy a woodland walk</h2>\n<p>Pull on your walking boots, fill up that flask and head out for some fresh autumn air and seasonal colour. There are loads of scenic spots you can reach by train – such as hiking to the top of Orrest Head which overlooks Lake Windermere (the walk starts 3 minutes from Windermere station). On a clear day the autumn colours are beautifully reflected in the lake. From Pitlochry station, a 30 minute train ride from Perth, you can take a gentle but glorious trail around Loch Dunmore and Faskally Forest. Head to Buxton in the Peak District and you can take in lush woodland on the Ring of Trees Walk, a 10 mile circuit that starts and ends in the town centre. Or, for something a little different, head to Brockenhurst in the New Forest to experience the autumnal tradition of ‘pannage’ – where hundreds of pigs are released into the wild to forage in the forest, joining the wild ponies that also freely roam this special area.</p>\n<p>Nearest station: Windermere, Pitlochry, Buxton, Brockenhurst</p>\n<h2>Escape to a rural retreat</h2>\n<p>Located within walking distance of Ludlow train station,<a href=\"https://www.thesalweylodge.co.uk/\"> The Lodge</a> is a Grade II listed home that offers bespoke stays for groups of up to eight adults. Guests have exclusive use of the historic home while enjoying a bespoke itinerary of walks and activities in the surrounding Shropshire countryside. In autumn, The Lodge offers a ‘Feast, Walk, Stay’ package that shines a light on local produce, particularly venison, which you’ll feast on in the house’s grand dining room. As well as curated trails around the local countryside you’ll have time to explore Ludlow itself – including a guided tour of Ludlow Brewery. You can also choose to go on a foraging walk in the local woods, have a cooking demonstration or head out on a bat and moth safari.</p>\n<p>Nearest station: Ludlow</p>\n<h2>Go foraging</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/ultimate-autumn-adventures-by-train-b2826710.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I know that’s a terribly compromising thing to admit before reviewing a Fuji camera, but I reckon transparency is more important than feigning neutrality. Besides, I don’t love <i>all</i> Fuji cameras, just the ones I own: The X-Pro 3 and the X100F. </p>\n<p>As someone who loathes how much of my life is spent staring at a screen, the thing I love most about my Fuji cameras is how tactile they are. There’s the manual dials, the sturdy build quality, the discreet size, the rangefinder aesthetics—not to mention Fuji’s famous colour reproduction and the quality of the JPEGs. All of this means I can enjoy my photography without having to lug heaps of kit around or having to spend any time tweaking dials on screens. I don’t even shoot RAW anymore. Bliss. </p>\n<p>Given my fondness for Fuji, I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to get my hands on Fuji X-Half. Released earlier this year, this teeny-weeny camera looks and feels just like a classic half-frame film camera. It features a 32mm (35mm equivalent) focal length, f2.8-11 aperture range with no zoom and a built-in flash (unfortunately just an LED). Arriving in three colours: Silver, charcoal and black, it’s a very attractive and well-made little thing that feels sturdy in your hands despite being small enough to fit in your pocket. The pocketability of the X-Half is worth pausing on, because while many cameras aspire towards pocketability, a great many of them are not. And they’re certainly not as good looking or as fun to play with as the X-Half—it’s a beautiful piece of kit. </p>\n    \n</body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://adventure.com/fuji-x-half-travel-camera-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The fintech tribe in India has been quietly levelling up for years. On September 15, 2025, <a href=\"https://livefromalounge.com/cred-full-scope-money-manager-yosemite/?utm_source=Sep2025Post&amp;utm_medium=inline&amp;utm_campaign=crosspost\">CRED unveiled Yosemite</a>, a significant expansion of its product universe that includes wealth tools, a mass-market co-branded credit card, and one area that will garner most of the headlines: Sovereign, an invite-only society and an 18-karat gold credit card aimed squarely at India’s most affluent.\n</p>\n<h3>What is Sovereign?</h3>\n<p>Sovereign is CRED’s premium membership programme: an invite‑only circle promising not just a payments instrument but a package of influence, access and highly curated experiences. At launch, it was described as a membership that bundles bespoke financial and lifestyle privileges — from early-stage investment syndicates to invitations to private auctions, and “white‑glove” travel services that explicitly extend to luxury mobility (yachts, jets) and curated civilian spaceflight experiences.</p>\n<p>Every accepted member will receive a custom‑crafted 18‑karat gold credit card, finished with premium guilloché engraving and etched with the member’s name. The physicality and workmanship of the card are positioned as part of the status signalling — this isn’t a metal card; it’s a crafted object.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://livefromalounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4905-1-1024x750.jpeg\" alt=\"A man is standing on a stage holding a credit card. Behind him is a large projection of an IndusInd Bank card with a chip, labeled &quot;LIMITED ISSUE 750 AU.&quot; The background is dark, and there are ropes visible on the stage.\"/>\n    </p>\n<h3>Who issues the card, and where will it work?</h3>\n<p>Because in India, only banks can issue credit cards, Sovereign is being issued in partnership with IndusInd Bank. The product has been revealed as being built on the RuPay EKAA tier — the new, premium variant in the RuPay family, designed to level with Visa Infinite and Mastercard World Elite.</p>\n<p>That choice is essential. Ekaa provides CRED and IndusInd with a way to deliver a super-premium payments experience, utilising a homegrown rails network rather than importing the benefits architecture of Visa or Mastercard. Acceptance globally may vary with Amex, but RuPay’s deeper integrations in India will minimise onboarding and domestic friction. Ekaa is also supposed to be the network where HDFC Infinia Bharat is supposed to be launched.</p>\n<p>Here is the video CRED put out at the event for Sovereign.</p>\n<p/>\n    <h3>Perks and privileges (what CRED says members will get)</h3>\n    <p>CRED has framed Sovereign less as a rewards card and more as a membership that confers influence and curated access. The headline privileges being talked about include those written above, and,</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><i/>– from priority booking for yachts and private jets to bespoke travel concierge services. CRED has even referenced access to curated civilian spaceflight experiences as part of the offering.<strong>White‑glove travel and mobility access</strong></li>\n      <li><i/>CRED has indicated that members will be offered top‑tier elite statuses at hotels and airlines. Exact partner lists and the route to status are yet to be published, but there is a reference to Singapore Airlines PPS Solitaire, Marriott Ambassador, Emirates Skywards Platinum and more.<strong>Upgraded loyalty status –</strong></li>\n      <li><i/>— visa, global medical access, telemedicine and bespoke concierge assistance for high‑value needs.<strong>High‑touch concierge services</strong></li>\n      <li>A one-year subscription to Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint programme</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Taken together, these privileges resemble the mix of social access, curated experiences, and financial upside that the world’s premium charge cards sell—but packaged by CRED, not a bank card with points alone. Here is what the text on the CRED Yosemite booklet that was handed out at the end of the Monday event.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://livefromalounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G0953beWEAA3Wu1-827x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"The image contains text on a dark background. The text reads: &quot;OPEN ALL DOORS. A Sovereign is unbound by borders. oceans part. skies open. yachts, private jets, helicopters, and on-demand luxury cars move at your command. and beyond it all, space itself awaits, ready to receive you. you unlock white-glove travel with visas handled at home, and elite status across the world’s top hospitality and airline programs (Hilton Diamond, Marriott Ambassador, Singapore Airlines Solitaire, Emirates Platinum, and more). end-to-end medical concierge ensures priority access to global hospitals, with doctors, treatments, and travel arranged seamlessly, telemedicine with international specialists and a one-year subscription to Bryan Johnson’s Blueprint program for lifespan extension complete the circle of care.&quot;\"/>\n    </p>\n<h3>Is Sovereign India’s Amex Black?</h3>\n<p>There are obvious parallels to the American Express Centurion (Black): invitation‑only access, an aura of rarity, a bespoke physical artefact, a heavy emphasis on concierge and experiential privileges, and membership‑level benefits that go beyond simple reward rates.</p>\n<p>Where Sovereign echoes Centurion:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong/>. Both cards trade based on scarcity and social signalling.<i>Exclusivity and an invitation‑only model</i></li>\n      <li><strong/>. The physical object is part of the story — a crafted card, not a plastic one.<i>Bespoke metal (or gold) physicality</i></li>\n      <li><strong/>: concierge, events, travel, and private deals.<i>Focus on influence, access, and white-glove services more than headline cashback percentages</i></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Where Sovereign will differ (or at least must differentiate):</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><i/>. Sovereign runs on RuPay EKAA via IndusInd; Centurion runs on Amex. Amex has a decades-long global merchant footprint and an established premium partner network; Sovereign’s merchant acceptance and partner portability will depend on the new RuPay tier and the bilateral arrangements CRED/IndusInd forge with airlines, hotels, and service providers.<strong>Network and acceptance</strong></li>\n      <li><i/>. Centurion’s benefits and relationships are battle‑tested over many years; Sovereign is newly launched and will need to build that ecosystem and prove the promised options actually materialise.<strong>Track record</strong></li>\n      <li><i/>. Centurion is a global icon; Sovereign is unabashedly tailored to Indian UHNI tastes — access to India‑centric deal flow, local auctions, and a membership culture that taps into the country’s emerging wealth class.<strong>Market positioning</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Sovereign is plausibly India’s answer to the Amex Black in spirit — a membership for the most affluent that packages access, experiences and status. Whether it will achieve the same mythic cultural standing depends on how CRED executes the partner integrations, fulfilment and alumni network it promises. For instance, some of the benefits listed appear to have been compiled without a clear understanding of how they are achieved. SQ Solitaire is reserved for Singapore Airlines’ most prestigious customers who only spend on SQ Premium Cabins, for instance. SGD 25,000 (INR 17 Lakhs) on SQ Business and First within 12 months.</p>\n<h3>What we still don’t know about CRED Sovereign?</h3>\n<p>CRED has been intentionally tight‑lipped on key commercial mechanics that matter to anyone trying to evaluate the Sovereign Card:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://boardingarea.com/?blog-post=creds-centurion-moment-the-sovereign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Turkish Airlines recently won a minority stake in Air Europa by accepting shared control of the company with the Hidalgo family, outmaneuvering    <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/lufthansa/\">Lufthansa</a> and    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lufthansa-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/air-france-klm/\">Air France-KLM</a>, both of which were seeking a path to control. This deal, which included around €300 million in convertible debt for a stake of roughly 25-27%, is relatively unusual for non-EU carriers, but aligns with overarching EU ownership rules, and gives Turkish Airlines a strategic foothold on the Iberian Peninsula.</p>\n    <p>Rival bidders balked at complex control constraints and governance guidelines, including a 20% stake from IAG. For Turkish Airlines, this move offers extensive geopolitical and network expansion benefits and relatively limited near-term financial gains. Government backing and a strong balance sheet further lower the company's execution risk. Analysts have been quick to note that this deal comes along with the risks associated with a minority stake, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/air-france-klm-no-longer-bidding-for-stake-in-air-europa/\">such as limited influence and strategic friction with the company</a>.</p>\n    <h2>A Deeper Look At The Deal On The Table</h2>\n    <p>Turkish Airlines has elected to invest a considerable sum into Air Europe, a major Spanish international airline, primarily financing the deal through convertible bonds. This deal will translate into a roughly 25% stake in the airline, with management saying it has no current plans to increase beyond that minority position. The official package, according to Reuters, is quoted <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/turkeys-surprise-air-europa-deal-came-down-one-key-thing-control-2025-09-18/\">as €275 million in convertible debt and €25 million in shares</a>.</p>\n    <p>As a result of the deal, Turkish Airlines is expected to gain at least one board seat. <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/airlines-vying-buy-air-europa/\">The deal still requires the approval of both Spanish and European regulators</a>. In statements to the media, Turkish Airlines framed the terms of the deal as cooperation-oriented, not a path towards complete control. In a comment posted by Reuters, one industry analyst had the following words to share regarding the deal's risks:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\"(The) risks of taking minority stakes include a lack of control, and a reduced ability to influence strategy.\"</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>What Does The Deal Mean For Turkish Airlines?</h2>\n    <p>Turkish Airlines gains quite a lot from this move. For starters, the Air Europa stake is much more than just a profit acquisition opportunity, and more so a chance to expand the reach of its network. A 25% position in the company will give the Turkish flag carrier a foothold in Madrid, the principal gateway between Europe and Latin America. This will significantly expand the airline's capabilities without breaching EU foreign ownership restrictions.</p>\n    <p>This will align the airline with Iberia and deepen the connection opportunities for passengers using Madrid as a transfer gateway. IAG will continue to play a major role in the airline's management, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/air-france-considers-buying-up-to-20-percent-air-europa-iag-deal-fail/\">with a 20% stake</a>. All of this continues to depend on the airline's super-connector strategy, which aims to connect passengers across multiple continents through a principal Istanbul hub.</p>\n    <p>The strategic limitations of this deal are important to keep in mind. For starters, there are relatively few strategic financial risks that emerge from this deal, with only a small amount of leverage likely to be added to the airline's balance sheet as a result. The upside of this deal, however, could be immense.</p>\n    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n    <p>At the end of the day, this move by Turkish Airlines falls in line with broader industry consolidation efforts that we have seen across the European aviation industry. Larger conglomerates continue to have an extensive reach across continents.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/british-airways/\">British Airways</a>, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, and many other major European flag carriers have slowly been pushed into conglomerates, expanding influence at the cost of competition. This consolidation in the full-service market has been scrutinized by analysts for its anti-competitive implications.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ba-icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n    <p>However, due to the massive low-cost presence in Europe, regulators have mostly tolerated this lack of competition. We will simply have to wait and see how this move directly impacts passengers.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/closer-look-turkish-airlines-strategic-investment-air-europa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The airline’s longest 787‑9 routes not only showcase the technological advances of modern aviation, in fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort, but also reflect shifting priorities in international air travel, expanding direct connectivity, seasonal demand, and premium service.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/american_airlines_icon.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>IATA Code</strong></li>\n      <li>AA</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>ICAO Code</strong></li>\n      <li>AAL</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Airline Type</strong></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/full-service-carriers/\">Full Service Carrier</a></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong>IATA/ICAO Code</strong></li>\n      <li>AA/AAL</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>From the new record breaker between     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/dallas-fort-worth-international-airport/\">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a>and     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dallas-fort-worth-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/brisbane-airport/\">Brisbane Airport</a>to seasonal hops over the Pacific, these routes map a changing global network that stretches the physical and commercial limits of what it means to fly nonstop. In this article, we’ll explore the furthest-reaching of American’s 787‑9 services, how far they fly, what makes them possible, and what they tell us about the future of ultra-long haul travel.</p>\n<h2>Ultra-Long-Haul Global Connectivity: 7,000 To 9,000 Miles</h2>\n<p> Several of American Airlines’ ultra-long-haul routes fall in the 7,000–9,000-mile range, linking the United States with key destinations across the world. The longest such example is Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW) to     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/brisbane-airport/\">Brisbane Airport</a> (BNE), measuring about 8,299 miles. American has around 144 flights in each direction scheduled on this route for the 787-9 this year, offering nearly 39,000 seats per leg. This nonstop service connects Texas to Australia’s third-largest city, reflecting growing demand for transpacific travel beyond traditional gateways like    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/los-angeles-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p>Another important market is DFW to     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/auckland-airport/\">Auckland Airport</a> (AKL) at 7,439 miles. With 138 flights each way and more than 39,000 seats per direction, this service strengthens American’s Pacific presence. By bypassing West Coast hubs, DFW–AKL provides direct connectivity for travelers from the central and eastern areas of the United States, supporting both leisure tourism and business ties with New Zealand. The route also enhances alliance connectivity, as American coordinates closely with Qantas in this region.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/auckland-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p>In Asia, the DFW to     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/shanghai-pudong/\">Shanghai Pudong International Airport</a> (PVG) route stands out at 7,351 miles. Scheduled for 248 eastbound and 247 westbound flights, it totals more than 70,000 seats per direction, by far the highest seat volume of the 7,000–9,000-mile routes, highlighting Shanghai’s role as a major economic hub.    <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shanghai-pudong-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<h2>Long-Haul Transoceanic And Intercontinental Services: 5,000 To 7,000 Miles</h2>\n<p>Several of American’s transoceanic flights fall within the 5,000–7,000-mile range, connecting the US to South America, Europe, and parts of Asia. A prime example is     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/new-york-jfk/\">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> (JFK) to     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/new-york-jfk-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/tokyohaneda/\">(HND) service at 6,773 miles. With 359 flights scheduled in each direction and over 102,000 seats, this route underscores the strong demand for nonstop US to Japan connectivity. Tokyo remains a critical hub for business and leisure travelers, and Haneda’s convenient location near the city center makes it a particularly attractive gateway.<graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tokyo-haneda-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Tokyo Haneda Airport</a>\n    </p>\n<p>On the South America front, the DFW to Buenos Aires'     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/ezeiza-international-airport/\">Ezeiza International Airport</a> (EZE) route spans 5,286 miles. With around 66 flights each way and more than 16,000 seats. Similarly, the DFW to    Sao Paulo Viracopos International Airport (GRU), at 5,111 miles, is a heavy hitter with 366 flights each way and more than 103,000 seats per direction. These connections are vital for trade and multinational corporate travel between the US and South America.    </p>\n<p>American also deploys its Boeing 787-9s on several transatlantic routes in this mileage band. For example,     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/philadelphia-international-airport/\">Philadelphia International Airport</a>(PHL) to     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/philadelphia-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/doha-hamad-international-airport/\">(DOH) at 6,798 miles operates daily, totaling 366 annual flights and over 104,000 seats. Another example is the route from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Tokyo Haneda (HND), which spans 5,488 miles, with over 240 annual flights in each direction and approximately 69,000 seats. These routes show an example of how American balances demand between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia in the medium to long-haul segment, leveraging Philadelphia and Los Angeles as key gateways in addition to New York and Dallas.<graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/doha-hamad-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\" loading=\"lazy\"/>Doha Hamad International Airport</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>A Comparison Of American's Longest Routes</h2>\n<p>Routes in the 5,000–7,000-mile bands form the backbone of American’s long-haul portfolio. These services generate over 850,000 seats and account for the largest share of long-haul ASMs. Markets such as New York–Tokyo Haneda, Philadelphia–Doha, and Dallas–São Paulo are the strongest contributors.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the 7,000–9,000-mile band features far fewer flights, just over 1,000 annually, but represents some of the most prestigious and demanding ultra-long-haul markets, showcasing the range and capability of the 787-9. Routes such as Dallas–Brisbane, Dallas–Auckland, and Dallas–Shanghai fall in this category, linking the US directly with Oceania and East Asia. While the seat totals are smaller at 297,000, the strategic importance is high, since these markets capture long-haul leisure demand, premium business travel, and alliance-driven connectivity.</p>\n<p>Mileage Band</p>\n<p>Flights</p>\n<p>Seats</p>\n<p>ASMs (Available Seat Miles)</p>\n<p>Avg. Distance (Miles)</p>\n<p>5,000–7,000</p>\n<p>3,039</p>\n<p>859,760</p>\n<p>5.24 billion</p>\n<p>~5,986</p>\n<p>7,000–9,000</p>\n<p>1,059</p>\n<p>297,059</p>\n<p>2.26 billion</p>\n<p>~7,696</p>\n<p>When comparing the two, it’s clear that the 5,000–7,000-mile routes deliver higher seat and frequency volumes, supporting steady traffic flows between established business and cultural hubs. Meanwhile, the 7,000–9,000-mile flights, though fewer, extend American’s global reach and diversify its network. Together, they illustrate American Airlines' long-haul strategy, consolidating its strength in medium- to long-haul transoceanic travel while competing in the ultra-long haul arena, where stage length and operating efficiency become key differentiators.</p>\n<h2>Balancing Domestic And Overseas Connectivity: 2,000 To 5,000 Miles</h2>\n<p>The 2,000–5,000-mile segments include many of American’s transatlantic services, linking US hubs to Europe. A strong example is the     <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/tag/philadelphia-international-airport/\">Philadelphia International Airport</a>(PHL) to     <graphic src=\"https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/philadelphia-international-airport.png?fit=contain&amp;h=22&amp;w=22\"/></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/american-airlines-longest-nonstop-routes-boeing-787-9-dreamliner-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Unlike typical cruise destinations, a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/andbeyond-galapagos-explorer-cruise-is-a-safari-at-sea\">Galapagos cruise</a> invites travelers to discover a collection of unspoiled, mostly uninhabited islands that are home to species found nowhere else. These voyages, however, are far from traditional. The ships are small, often accommodating as few as 16 passengers, ensuring an intimate experience. Forget water parks, Broadway-style shows, or casinos. These cruises focus solely on the natural world—providing an up-close, environmentally responsible way to witness everything from the islands’ iconic giant tortoises to playful sea lions. On board, you'll find kayaks, paddleboards, and scuba equipment, with most itineraries featuring active excursions that can include kayaking alongside marine life, snorkeling with sea lions, and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-tallest-active-volcanoes-you-can-actually-climb\">hiking through volcanic landscapes</a>.

After flying into Quito or Guayaquil in Ecuador, passengers typically spend a night there before flying to the islands to board their ships.</p>\n<p>When is the best time to cruise the Galapagos Islands?</p>\n<p>With a consistently mild climate year-round, the Galapagos can be visited at any time, although certain seasons offer exceptional wildlife viewing. <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-december\">December</a> is when the giant tortoises hatch, and July marks the mating season for blue-footed boobies and short-eared owls. In April and May, marine iguanas typically hatch, while sea turtles begin laying their eggs at the start of the year. Given the diverse wildlife and year-round natural phenomena, there's never a \"wrong\" time to visit the islands.</p>\n<p>Are Galapagos cruises expensive?</p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands aren’t a bargain destination. Expect to pay somewhere between $5,000 and $12,000 per traveler, depending on the ship, itinerary, and length of the voyage. But one thing’s for sure: Whatever your preference, there’s a Galapagos Islands cruise for you.</p>\n<p>Do I need a passport to go on a Galapagos cruise?</p>\n<p>Yes, most travelers will need a <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/worlds-most-powerful-passports\">passport</a> to visit the Galapagos Islands, which are part of Ecuador. While the islands are a protected area, they are still under Ecuadorian jurisdiction, so travelers must have a valid passport to board the cruise and access the islands.</p>\n<p>What kind of wildlife can I expect to see on a Galapagos cruise?</p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands are renowned for their unique wildlife, including giant tortoises, marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and sea lions. The islands’ ecosystems are so diverse that you can see a variety of species in different environments, from <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/what-to-know-before-visiting-active-volcano-expert-advice\">volcanic shores</a> to lush highlands.</p>\n<h2>Best Galapagos cruise for wildlife lovers</h2>\n<p>Celebrity Cruises’ Galapagos itineraries offer a unique and luxurious experience that is perfect for <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-wildlife-cruises\">wildlife lovers</a>. The <i>Celebrity Flora</i> and <i>Celebrity Xploration,</i> both small, eco-conscious ships, are designed to navigate the remote and pristine areas of the Galapagos Islands, providing access to places that larger vessels simply can't reach. This smaller scale allows for more intimate and undisturbed wildlife encounters. Onboard, expert naturalist guides with deep knowledge of the islands’ ecosystems lead informative excursions that enhance the experience, ensuring that guests not only witness the region’s iconic species, like giant tortoises and blue-footed boobies, but also understand their ecological importance.</p>\n<p>Celebrity’s focus on sustainability is evident in its design; the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/exploring-the-galapagos-on-the-celebrity-flora\"> Celebrity Flora</a>, for example, is equipped with a dynamic positioning system that helps protect delicate marine habitats, and all excursions are structured to minimize human impact on the environment. Guests can also enjoy water-based activities like snorkeling and kayaking, getting up close to the abundant marine life, including sea lions, penguins, and marine turtles, in their natural habitats. The cruise’s commitment to environmental responsibility extends to its gourmet dining, which features locally sourced ingredients that support sustainable fishing practices. Furthermore, Celebrity works closely with conservation organizations such as the Charles Darwin Foundation to promote sustainable tourism and preserve the fragile ecosystems of the islands. Overall, Celebrity Cruises offers wildlife enthusiasts a perfect blend of luxury, adventure, and eco-conscious exploration, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the beauty and diversity of the Galapagos while contributing to the preservation of its unique ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>Best affordable Galapagos cruise</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-galapagos-cruises\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>If there’s one thing to know about the best Greek islands to visit, it’s that you can never truly know them all. Not only are there more than 200 inhabited <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-30-islands-in-the-world-readers-choice-awards-2014\">islands</a>—big, small, well-connected, and utterly remote—scattered across the Aegean, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/what-100-mediterranean-grandmothers-shared-about-leading-happy-lives\">Mediterranean</a>, and Ionian seas, but many of them are changing. Fast.</p>\n<p>Old-time favorites Mykonos and Santorini remain popular, but many of their Cycladic sisters—Paros, Milos, Naxos, and Folegandros, all long-time favorites with Greeks—are quickly creeping onto the radar of international travelers too, thanks to thoughtful new <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-greek-island-hotels\">Greek island hotels</a> that might even be considered some of the best hotels in Greece as a whole. Alongside them, an ever-growing roster of restaurants and bars.</p>\n<p>Other Greek islands—Kastellorizo, Kythnos, Astypalea—remain somewhat hush-hush, mainly frequented by in-the-know locals reluctant to share their secrets, while islands such as Patmos and Leros are slowly making their way onto it-lists with global art, design, and fashion crowds.</p>\n<p>Yet still, there are many more islands to choose from. Whether your vacation checklist consists of securing a table at a restaurant hotspot and dancing all night at a beach bar, hiking lush forests stopping at ancient archeological sites, or lazing on small beach coves before eating a toes-in-the-sand meal at a local taverna, there’s a Greek island to suit the bill. Better still, on lots of them you’ll find it all, and the Greek islands have a long season in the sun; the hottest months are <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-july\">July</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-august\">August</a>, but temperatures hover in the mid-70s throughout shoulder-season months too (<a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-may\">May</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-june\">June</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-places-to-travel-september\">September</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/the-best-places-to-travel-in-october\">October</a>). These are 34 of the best Greek islands to visit.</p>\n<p>How we choose the best Greek islands</p>\n<p>Here, we've ranked the best Greek islands. While we love and highly recommend every island on this list—and advocate visiting all of them throughout your lifetime, if you can—we've also edited the list to help you pick if it's your first time planning a visit to this magical corner of the world, or you just want to branch out from your usual summer isle trip. The order below reflects our well-traveled team's personal opinions, the landscapes, food, beaches, hotels, and more.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Getty Images<h2>1. Milos</h2><strong>Best for:</strong>A photogenic and dramatic coastline<p>Everyone knows the Venus de Milo (which has stood in the Louvre since the 19th century). Until recently, very few had heard of Milos, the volcanic island where Aphrodite’s graceful likeness was discovered. Those in the know jealously guard their treasured island, and especially its 70 (or more) beaches—surely the most diverse and dramatic coastline of all the Greek Islands.</p><p>Little by little, though, Milos is being discovered. Instagram is saturated with no-filter shots of the undulating white cliffs at Sarakiniko, the bottle-green swimming hole at Papafragas, and colorful, rickety syrmata—tiny boat houses wedged between rock and sea. (You’ll find the best photo opportunities at Klima and Mandrakia). This painterly landscape was shaped by the minerals that have long been a source of wealth—obsidian, alum, barite, and sulfur, which still bubble up in the island’s many</p><a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/most-beautiful-hot-springs\">hot springs</a>.

Paros</h2>\n<p>Though it’s commonly touted as “the next Mykonos,”</p>\n<p>But things are changing, especially in popular Naousa where it seems there’s a never-ending influx of new hotspots to peruse as you wind your way through its quintessential maze of whitewashed streets, each abuzz with boutique stores by day and lively drinking and dining spots by night. Forever favorites still stand strong though, and I’ll always pay a visit to the 1963-established Kafeneion i Palia Agora for the low-key vibe paired with home-cooked meat and zucchini balls, and to harborside Barbarossa for all manner of seafood sizzled to perfection and paired with a party in the port (book well in advance). There’s also a coveted hotel scene here, with plenty of high-end boutique hotels opening up around the island’s coastline. Though their numbers can’t compare to those of neighboring Mykonos and Santorini, their charm does.</p>\n<p>When you get bored of the new, experience the old in the small fishing villages on the south of the island, like Aliki and Drios, where days lazing by the sea segue into long evening dinners which will definitely feature locally caught catch-of-the-day, and probably a glass or two of the local brandy too. Ask for souma to try it. —</p>\n<ul><li>For romance: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/9PDXkxpg5or1rkab8k1kmQhnw8dyBQ8aZfrG3qKod6KFFiG12sykTe1D697qFMZyudqEJKa7d2i2jnwCnWQRr1vga8iHN1qFGq4jCNRrGNVWzAv2DLtuzC11fUezde2fbzKYxFqTBheCLnkLFoHVi8xhKiJivAKxxyy16aeJcTXF4cvNCw3YAiKu3eHxpm7JE8vAHvbvWXE4QHdCJrsqidPxY2p2bwwwCZpBLbeySYDC1FfpaRdnzPi1RGiPtZt6c9tFG8VBmjCYk1ycRyc8umpmNwXufyuoEjnUQgTNmrHHtZpCPbd7HYtGGLBMUiuUp\">Cosme</a>or<a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DRqZQmpTgrbg1Ru5DBeHR8iRFu8TSHN5bvuxSvk27ZbzjS9WF9joAyy1KEMaS8v9SFn2CTY9LrA2mKzyy4krErTfuaHs6xnNBcWcpb45QQEUjRrb8ctZJJPVCFKuLVVxa5zUEuvWMA2F67fQUEBu3JtCRVMQycXG4T1r2gxTfFYU46FXQa1DedQosofscivUR2JShKDfCq9gtUjtuw3VpkLzuhkfAFW46kbtedhTFReHEQWhEuJp9oHMB8DgkZjWWZLZXJmfxnXECuwt7LFvfgw755ToDyBRQMbUK8hE3r6PdDurwdCNKsGHpx3QfXK9EoZvt\">Parocks</a></li><li>For a beachside location: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EbxtFkHZLuQbF1gR52PMHraE7oHc8roX1disHBtXCqv3G84qaQddzkEbAKTzXHL97jhU39hem1bvCCR22kuGk2Ua6qs4Qi19Fd5WWTNpE1qUCZrkCy9UBfEyfovZPNXjitGGKSmpWfVo9mS6eKW6asvfxJKGP9tf34W4pWCiwKqzGhAw3UQBxXmYdWJXTbtUVE54DULyNkbyQQqpZ1Qu17DsegNdYWqyDX2aLti2CeVjemYCs9v7UBFg7HZ8P9JvrbEXtVPUcW7yzsoJSq7GbaPoAsRkX7DwCb2f1hNW5cgXY5XbYFxLM6dxCPcWhQmP4nCXuy2Aqrp2ykyVqGhA\">Avant Mar</a></li><li>For views: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/wrdL3vpUnuv3AttqamyZTX3p4m5ugbE3KAxjjSCsuxuTpHzY5TZto4SCPTwpZwwaEUDiHa8TpbxrnervSTaYL9Jij3wS9DbxKCBKfPVuqVZPLxxJaoWyWT5JCeoXypREBndSPqy736Ph6YfBy5S8pYstjhdURTTRiHov6Q6xmTG9Cpb1nKWCCoh1SDXNUWp2fq3R7p51h9WSnBPQCgjryo4bScxPTwApuR6vnM74rbubaDBtHL77aLrjWnixnSKrYVgKt7gcWnCqrTVVjxxSAKer1ZjCX3ZgcizYfpcPfBpu3HooXGqFqKm89MsEE9jQbZyzLc\">Mythic</a></li><li>For a private stay: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbqyipJ939TpGWUCCCGg7PK3G3ghopJeaDQoVeE7Yj8XfQRHhtYfd335o5EL4SMhRZzAagWBRxXVt9X9A9ki9czY2UqS8QKhAs95qNAaudNFb9BhgJvnAgiAsYf6vv4hwZU38MmgY7cpNHxavkqCyEtQnofEijMhfEHXMAspiVK75f2mzpDzBCdJxUbCnrXWDohe4DNaahAPyKRoM8QHiSSx5rMFGCy4EAKYdogcsjc3AA8R3tXRWPXbSQGPnjWJp9wjMnRubcQ2ZXvqRaoFX8wCiuEUw27R96\">this sunset Airbnb villa for two</a></li><li>For modern design: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/hVt5qe48J652xzM845EnZzMnu7zU6KdJcWtYuvYWZoADCoS94orhQQa3YejcGrBekVQfP97tsD2kHYnEPdLD8cXN3Nsrxcq2JhhY6QaD1yn4WSAGVW524uySQ5kW8hqEsNL6YazAjw9GCL2TkLNwfwPWvPAXUsLmXLtN9XiAYwXaHHrokndbY4oTSSwXSJpnBrM8bW7mXYKrkcLiu7Z7JkDbBM1WGGBYu5r6DyR4zvWWsb4JmGYXsmXkVUc3ZeUWFHoiKYxLDAmf4Z5TAuX8pE8w5k28pWYeBVdHEZKKpRidgAxs4YJVaJqSfyhyYUpA4tu1mVFs5pZUwTYJp\">Parīlio</a></li><li>For groups: <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/e14Jm3PRWDmLnbMFfArLB1d3jviAxu6T9CURRWHznJTXuw7D9J1UpaKvMgq9xMnaBKZshSyAE2Y6fskF1rnQfM5wfF3DDaBrjZ5CVpbFMtvpgYc7xrw46fTXQ7V6tJv6Rd2USgd24BKn13PaDNTWzBizSTzkuf2DHAb5Z38gVbnXWNKy3ZTpYSh3EbXW5aLkcccoHs5TGU7TbcPSs8B6VMJNTPbGBwRi9iV6zRZKLvLhm95dHd9vydK1TeGy3MWdgkC5SCEXwtz5sEBK8hF7PPPSksdqsfCNAGRLjWGzZybKnEw7KRLmmN1Rw1SLmSayuN\">Casa Miel</a>(sleeps up to 12)</li></ul>\n<p>For more recommendations, see our guide to the</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-greek-islands-to-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Built in 1901 by Ralph and Christena Palmer, this establishment and its restaurant/pub have been welcoming guests for well over a century.</p>\n<p>The hotel is a three-story brick building, standing on the corner of Sinclair Lewis Avenue and Main Street. Nobel prize winner Sinclair Lewis, who grew up in Sauk Centre and once worked here, later immortalized it in his novel <em>Main Street</em>.</p>\n<p>It was built on the grounds of the town's first hotel, the Sauk Centre House, after it burned down in 1900. From the very start, it's been the talk of the town, with locals embracing it as a first-class hotel. It was the first building in Sauk Centre with electricity.</p>\n<p>Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was renovated in 1993 to include modern amenities while preserving the vision of its creators. There are now 19 rooms, each with its own bathroom, so guests no longer have to share a common \"necessary room\" down the hall.</p>\n<p>The hotel lobby includes big arched windows and stained glass windows that were imported all the way from Vienna.</p>\n<p>The Palmer House is surrounded by spooky lore, with tales of ghosts and spirit children said to lurk on the stairs, play in the hallways, and inhabit certain rooms. It's a magnet for paranormal investigators and curious thrill-seekers alike. Sure, when you first step inside, it feels more like a cozy retreat than a haunted mansion, but don't let that fool you. Owner Kelley Freese, who's been at the helm for over 20 years, has plenty of spine-tingling stories to share about the hotel's spectral inhabitants. Legend says Sinclair Lewis himself haunts its halls.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-palmer-house-hotel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While Barcelona, Madrid, and Ibiza are famous for a reason, the true soul of Spain is often found in its remote corners. One of the areas I love the best is Northern Spain, with its green mountains, rugged coastline, and medieval villages, offers an entirely different perspective. It doesn’t get as many visitors as the hotspots in the south but it is just as beautiful in my opinion.</p>\n<p>If you want to see a quieter side of Spain, consider stepping off the usual tourist trail and heading north after your <a href=\"https://www.aireuropa.com/en-us/flight-deals-to-madrid\">flight to Madrid</a>. Spend a few days in Madrid (which is amazing) and then train it north for a week or more to wander along paths the Romans once carved into mountains, explore deserts few travelers know, and hike to villages where traditions persist centuries after empires have fallen.</p>\n<p>Today, I want to share three destinations that I love: Las Médulas, the Bardenas Reales, and Santillana del Mar. Each offers a unique blend of history, natural beauty, and cultural immersion, and each is accessible enough from Madrid.</p>\n<p>Table of Contents</p>\n<h3>1. Las Médulas</h3>\n<p>Nearly two millennia ago, Roman engineers transformed this landscape in search of gold. Using a technique called ruina montium (“wrecking of mountains”), they channeled water through tunnels to collapse entire hillsides, revealing the region’s gold deposits. The result is a surreal landscape of jagged red cliffs, hollows, and gullies, softened by forests of chestnut trees and dotted with walking trails. Today, Las Médulas is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a testament to human ingenuity and the enduring power of nature. Hiking through the gullies and Roman galleries, it’s easy to imagine the labor and vision required to reshape this rugged terrain.</p>\n<p>What I love about Las Médulas is the quiet. Even in high season, you can find stretches of trail where the only sounds are your footsteps and the rustle of leaves. The views from the ridges are spectacular, and the scent of chestnuts lingers in the air. It is a place that makes you slow down, not just to take photos but to let the history and the stillness sink in.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Highlights and Trails</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Senda de las Valiñas (4km loop):</strong>This gentle trail winds through shady chestnut groves and past openings to Roman tunnels. It is perfect for an easy morning walk that still gives you a sense of the site’s scope. Stop often to look up at the cliffs; the red soil against the greenery makes for striking photos.</li>\n      <li><strong>Mirador de Orellán:</strong>A short but steep climb leads to a platform overlooking the scarlet ridges and valleys. Sunset is my favorite time here when the fading light turns the cliffs almost orange. There is also a small gallery where you can see how the Romans dug into the rock.</li>\n      <li><strong>Galería de Orellán:</strong>If you enjoy a bit of adventure, explore this restored mining tunnel. Standing inside, you can imagine workers hauling out earth by torchlight.</li>\n      <li><strong>Senda Perimetral (14km loop):</strong>For committed hikers, this path circles the whole archaeological area. You will pass secluded forests, small farms, and the occasional wild boar track. It is long but not difficult, and you will often have it to yourself.</li>\n      <li><strong>Castro de Chano:</strong>A short drive away, this pre-Roman hillfort shows that the story of Las Médulas stretches back much further than the Romans.</li>\n      <li><strong>Mirador de Reirigo:</strong>A lesser-known lookout with a quiet bench and sweeping views across chestnut forests and distant hills.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p><strong>Practical Details</strong><br/>\n<strong>Where to Stay</strong>: Ponferrada is only half an hour away and has a wide range of hotels and guesthouses.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Season</strong>: Autumn for golden foliage and crisp air. Spring brings mild weather and blooming wildflowers.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Bring water and a snack, especially if you plan to attempt the longer hikes. Maps or a GPS app will help you stick to the marked trails.<br/>\n </p>\n<h3>2. Bardenas Reales</h3>\n<p>Heading south from Pamplona, the landscape changes dramatically. Rolling farmland gives way to dry plains and eventually a semi-desert of ochre mesas and dramatic ravines. This is the Bardenas Reales, a 42,000-hectare natural park in Navarre. This place is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and an area of active military use, yet shepherds still graze their flocks across the plains, and wildlife such as griffon vultures and foxes thrive. The park’s isolation means you will often have most of the trails to yourself.</p>\n<p>The first time I visited, I was surprised at how varied the scenery was. From a distance, it looks barren, but once inside, you notice details: rippling patterns in the clay, hardy flowers clinging to cracks, the occasional sheepdog trotting behind a herd. The sense of space is exhilarating. It is a destination that invites wandering and rewards those who take their time.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Sights and Routes</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/off-beaten-path-spain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A one-time fee of $30 gets you member benefits for life, and if you use your membership correctly, you’ll easily make your initial investment back (and then some). Every year, you get 10 percent of what you spend back as REI credit. Spend $300 at REI in a year and that’s your $30 back in your pocket. Granted, you do have to spend the credit at REI, but you were going to do that anyway, weren’t you?

    "body": "<p>A good hotel embodies the aesthetic, the vibe, and the flavor of its location. Populus, a newly-opened <a href=\"https://populusseattle.com/\">boutique hotel in Seattle’s Pioneer Square</a>, is a <i>great</i> hotel. Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest surrounds guests upon entering the lobby. Exposed brick and reclaimed wood accent deep, saturated colors, warm lighting, and plush textures throughout the public spaces, and cozy rooms are fit with curated artworks and windows overlooking one of Seattle’s most historic districts. What separates Populus from other localized boutiques, though, is that all this is simply topical – the core of its greatness lies in how the brand functions, and in how that ethos drives the guest experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/twenger/\">Tim Wenger</a>Sep 18, 2025</p>\n<p>I traveled in August to Seattle to report on Populus. The original assignment was to write a review based on my experience there, much like I’d attempted at <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/populus-hotel-denver/\">the original Populus location in Denver</a>. But as I learned in Colorado, the Populus experience is as much about how a traveler impacts their location as is about what they take away from it. Parent company <a href=\"https://urban-villages.com/\">Urban Villages</a> and hospitality management brand <a href=\"https://www.aparium.com/\">Aparium</a> stepped way out on a limb with the concept of a “carbon-positive” hotel. The mantra is embedded into everything here – from the kitchen at Salt Harvest to the solar farm on the hotel’s roof. As such, I feel that in order to honestly evaluate the property, a better way to approach writing about Populus would be to write about how the hotel fits values of environmental stewardship regarding its dining, design, and location.</p>\n<h2>Staying at Populus Seattle</h2>\n<p>First, though, the basics. Rooms at Populus start around $239 per night – not a cheap date. Many spends are removed by staying here, though. There’s no need for a car – arrive by transit, commute via that, foot, or micromobility. There’s no need to go offsite for coffee or workspace – I spent each morning on my laptop in the Library, sipping fresh (and free) joe while hammering out story edits. Breakfast is available at Salt Harvest (I loved the peanut-butter-stuffed Hong Kong French Toast and the acai bowl). The onsite cafe adjacent to Salt Harvest serves caffeinated drinks in the morning and converts into a cocktail lounge in time for happy hour.</p>\n<p>Most rooms are small – standards king or double-queen rooms run under 300 square feet, Alder Double Queens and Cedar Corner Kings run between 300 and 350 square feet. That space is optimized with a workdesk, TV, mini-bar in the closet, and a window-side reading seat. Books on local flora and fauna sit on the side table. Travelers can go larger with suites up to 1,050 square feet. Bathrooms feature zero-waste Aesop toiletries and rain showers, with Pendleton blankets on the bed.</p>\n<h2>Connecting guests to the community</h2>\n<p>Photo: Ric Stovall</p>\n<p><i>Matador Network</i> believes that at its best, travel is an unequivocal force for good in the world. That venturing beyond one’s backyard opens minds, increases empathy, and brings humanity closer together, therefore changing the place as positively as it changes the person. Populus embodies this in many ways, most visibly through its Pacific Northwest-inspired design and extensive collection of localized art. Once I moved past the douglas fir in the lobby, the next thing I noticed at Populus Seattle were the large works of art that adorned the lobby and Salt Harvest restaurant. The hotel’s art program is shaped by <a href=\"https://www.artxiv.com/\">ARTXIV</a>, a curatorial house led by Dominic Nieri that treats the hotel as both gallery and residency.</p>\n<p>More than 300 works by about 35 artists—most based in the Pacific Northwest and many from local Indigenous communities—were commissioned for the property. A 2024 residency program brought artists to work in a building adjacent to Populus currently being remodeled by Urban Villages that will soon house not just artist studios but coworking, a business incubator, and event space. The residency aimed to help artists produce pieces directly inspired by the site and its surroundings. The collection is intentionally dynamic: all of it is available for purchase, and as works sell, they are replaced with new commissions, ensuring the art remains a living, evolving presence within the hotel. My room, and all rooms onsite, feature one such piece of art. Thematically, the pieces highlight the ecology and culture of the region. Exhibitions like <i>Populus: Origins</i> reveal the creative process behind the hotel’s identity, showing sketches and developmental works alongside finished art.</p>\n<h2>Regenerative dining — and travel as a force for good</h2>\n<p>Populus also embodies regenerative travel through its mantra of environmental stewardship. This stewardship is readily apparent in the kitchen at <a href=\"https://populusseattle.com/salt-harvest/\">Salt Harvest</a>, the hotel’s seasonally driven, Pacific Northwest–inspired restaurant. As much as possible, ingredients are sourced from regenerative farms, fisheries, and ranches. The menu changes with the seasons – with a focus on local seafood and veggies – and emphasizes elemental cooking techniques like open flame, hearth, and smoke. Pickling and canning help the restaurant stay regenerative through the year.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/populus-seattle-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Saint Lucia has reliably lured honeymooners since the 1960s, but in recent years the island became known as a hot spot for business as well as romance. Dubbed Caribbean’s Best Corporate Retreat Destination by the World MICE Awards in 2023, Saint Lucia continues to expand its infrastructure for business travelers.</p>\n<p>The only sovereign country named after a woman, Saint Lucia possesses an otherworldly beauty befitting its nickname, “Helen of the West Indies.” I first visited Saint Lucia years ago for work and was awestruck by the majesty of the island — its lush magnificence stands apart from even its most picturesque Caribbean neighbors. Though I was in the tropics on business, it very quickly felt like leisure. The Caribbean proves an ideal MICE region because the serenity and sunshine of island life counteract the anxiety and nerves associated with large corporate events or retreats. And while the island may be only 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, it’s home to a diverting array of unique meeting sites and event venues for travelers.</p>\n<p>© LADERA RESORT</p>\n<p>Saint Lucia’s luxurious hilltop resorts remain one of the island’s most alluring draws, and the properties accommodate business travelers, as well. The island is famous for its three-walled hotel rooms, a concept pioneered by <a href=\"https://www.ladera.com/\">Ladera Resort</a>, the only resort built on a UNESCO World Heritage site. Perched on a volcanic ridge between the Pitons, guest suites open to sweeping views of the Caribbean Sea. The open-air property proves ideal for outdoor events — even the most mundane team building exercise is elevated by such a gorgeous backdrop. <a href=\"https://www.jademountain.com/\">Jade Mountain Resort</a>, another three-walled, ultra-elegant property, offers views as stunning from the boardroom as they are from the bedroom.</p>\n<p>© ZOËTRY MARIGOT BAY</p>\n<p>Other notable properties for business travel include the <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/sluhcqq-harbor-club-st-lucia/\">Harbor Club</a>, boasting the most event space in Rodney Bay, and <a href=\"https://www.hyattinclusivecollection.com/en/resorts-hotels/zoetry/st-lucia/marigot-bay-st-lucia/?src=corp_lclb_google_seo_zomsl&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=lmr\">Zoëtry Marigot Bay</a>, which features customizable venues and personal assistants. Bay Gardens lists an array of venues across its Saint Lucia properties, and the all-inclusive <a href=\"https://www.royaltonresorts.com/resorts/st-lucia\">Royalton Saint Lucia</a> caters to large groups with 6,000 square feet of event space. Corporate travelers should also consider the tech- forward <a href=\"https://www.landingsstlucia.com/st-lucia-group-events\">Admirals’ Room</a> at <a href=\"https://www.landingsstlucia.com/\">The Landings</a> or the Royal Palm conference room at <a href=\"https://www.windjammer-landing.com/\">Windjammer Landing</a>. Additionally, the 2026 opening of <a href=\"https://www.ailaresorts.com/\">A’ILA Resort</a> marks another major investment in corporate travel, as the property will offer the most event space of any hotel on Saint Lucia with a grand hall accommodating 2,000 guests.</p>\n<p>Annual events draw visitors to the island, with the <a href=\"https://www.saintluciajazzandartsfestival.com/\">Jazz &amp; Arts Festival</a> in May, <a href=\"https://carnivalsaintlucia.com/\">Carnival</a> in July and Creole Day in October. Luckily, increased airlift makes travel to the Caribbean island easier than ever, improving accessibility for bleisure travelers. In 2024 <a href=\"https://www.jetblue.com/\">JetBlue</a> doubled its daily non- stop service from New York, and <a href=\"https://www.aa.com/homePage.do\">American Airlines</a> added a second daily flight from Miami. Connectivity within the Caribbean has improved, as well, in the last year: <a href=\"https://www.sunriseairways.net/en\">Sunrise Airways</a> launched daily service from Antigua, <a href=\"https://www.winair.sx/\">WINAIR</a> introduced twice-weekly flights from Barbados, and <a href=\"https://airadelphi.com/\">Air Adelphi</a> started thrice-weekly charters to Martinique and Saint Vincent in April.</p>\n<p><strong>UNIQUE VENUES</strong><br/>\nVilla Susanna on Marigold Bay, a uniquely luxurious hideaway, perches on a bluff overlooking the Caribbean Sea. The villa, surrounded by 3 acres of tropical gardens and lush greenery, offers complete privacy and proves ideal for an intimate corporate getaway — the main house is flanked by three separate cottages with a total of seven guest bedrooms, sleeping up to 14 people. The seclusion of the stylish main house perfectly hosts full-day summits and group dining, with a sundeck and large plunge pool nearby for decompressing after a day of work.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.villasusanna-saintlucia.com/\">villasusanna-saintlucia.com</a></p>\n<p>Situated on a historic 18th-century sugar plantation nestled between the Pitons, <a href=\"https://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/sugar-beach\">Sugar Beach</a> is a tropical oasis only 18 miles from <a href=\"https://stlucia-airport.com/\">Hewanorra International Airport</a>. Business travelers can reserve beachside bungalows along the white- sand coast or hilltop cottages overlooking the aquamarine waters of Jalousie Bay. Capitalize on the extensive indoor-outdoor event space and reserve the 3,280-square-foot Executive Boardroom, as elegantly designed as the rest of the property. Nestled within a 100-acre rainforest, its activities include hiking, diving and soaking in the volcanic mud baths of Sulfur Springs. At the end of a long retreat, relax and rejuvenate at the world-class Rainforest Spa, incorporating native, locally sourced ingredients.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.viceroyhotelsandresorts.com/sugar-beach\">viceroyhotelsandresorts.com</a></p>\n<h3>Read This Next</h3>\n<p>Introducing</p>\n<p>FX Excursions offers the chance for once-in-a-lifetime experiences in destinations around the world.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.globaltravelerusa.com/fx-excursions/\">Explore Excursions</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/globaltravelermag/\">Insta Feed</a></p>\n<h3>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.globaltravelerusa.com/7-fall-and-winter-hotel-openings-to-look-out-for-from-ihg-hotels-resorts/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7 Fall and Winter Hotel Openings to Look Out for from IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ihg.com/hotels/us/en/reservation\">IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts</a> boasts more than 6,700 open hotels across 20 brands in more than 100 countries.

If you're happy with the welcome offer and accept, then a hard inquiry will be made on your credit report.

And, to mark the occasion, the Business Platinum is offering its highest-ever offer.</p>\n<p>As is common with card refreshes, the Business Platinum's annual fee has increased to $895 (see <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/tc/7758?pid=7758&amp;name=The%20Business%20Platinum%20Card%C2%AE%20from%20American%20Express&amp;data-testid=ratesFees\">rates and fees</a>). That makes it among the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/annual-fee-worth-it/\">most expensive</a> business cards on the market.</p>\n<p>With an annual fee that high, receiving the highest welcome offer possible is important. So, here's what you need to know about the current offer on the Amex Business Platinum.</p>\n<h2>Current Amex Business Platinum welcome offer</h2>\n<p>New <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/oc/7758?name=The Business Platinum Card® from American Express&amp;pid=7758?tid=post\">Business Platinum</a> applicants can earn 200,000 bonus points after spending $20,000 on eligible purchases within the first three months of card membership.</p>\n<p>That's the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/american-express-best-welcome-offers/\">highest-ever offer</a> we've seen on this card, so this is the best time to apply.</p>\n<p>Based on our September 2025 <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/\">valuations</a>, those 200,000 <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/ultimate-guide-amex-membership-rewards/\">Membership Rewards</a> points are worth $4,000. That makes it one of the most valuable welcome offers we've ever seen.</p>\n<p>It's possible to get even more value if you <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/redeeming-american-express-membership-rewards-maximum-value/\">redeem your Amex Membership Rewards points</a> for lucrative redemptions.</p>\n<p>To earn the full 200,000-point bonus, your business must spend a lot on the card quickly. With its hefty initial spending requirement and statement credits (which we'll talk about below), this card is targeted toward businesses with employees and significant expenses.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Amex only allows cardmembers to earn <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/american-express-bonus-lifetime-restrictions/\">one welcome bonus per card</a> in a lifetime.

The Stadler Flirt H<sub>2</sub> multiple-unit is now operating Metrolink commuter services on the Arrow Line from San Bernardino Downtown to Redlands University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inaugural service departed from San Bernardino Downtown station at 10.32 on September 13. SBCTA says that the Flirt H<sub>2</sub> is the first hydrogen train to be compliant with US Federal Railroad Administration standards (FRA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two-car train has a maximum speed of 127km/h, and a total of 116 seats. Capable of being refuelled in 30 minutes, it has a range of 460km, according to Stadler. During testing at the Transportation Technology Center (TTC) in Pueblo, Colorado, it achieved 2803km and set the Guinness World Record for the longest distance covered by a hydrogen fuel cell multiple-unit without refuelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With funding from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the hydrogen train was ordered in 2019 to operate alongside two Stadler Flirt low-emission DMUs which entered service on the 14.5km Arrow Line in October 2022. Following testing in Switzerland, the Flirt H<sub>2 </sub>was shipped to the United States in 2023 and arrived in San Bernadino in mid-2024. Testing on the Arrow Line began in November last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deployment of the new train has required an upgrade of the existing Arrow rolling stock maintenance facility, including construction of the hydrogen storage and refuelling facility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For detailed data on North American passenger fleet orders, subscribe to </em><a href=\"https://irjpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>IRJ Pr</em>o</a>.</p>\n</span></div></div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.railjournal.com/fleet/first-hydrogen-passenger-train-enters-service-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its rival Uber Eats is now getting in on the action.</p>\n    <p>Uber on Thursday announced it invested in Israel-based drone delivery provider Flytrex, with which it plans to launch an autonomous service in Uber Eats pilot markets later this year. The move follows the company’s partnership with Joby Aviation, <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/uber-joby-blade-electric-air-taxi-service/\">announced</a> earlier this month, to bring aerial ridesharing—including electric air taxis—to its core platform.</p>\n    <p>Flytrex drones are <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/doordash-flytrex-launch-drone-delivery-in-dallas-fort-worth/\">already delivering</a> for DoorDash in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where the platform also works with Alphabet’s Wing. Flytrex and Wing are the first drone delivery providers in the U.S. to <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/crowded-skies-drone-operators-in-dallas-share-airspace-for-first-time/\">operate in shared airspace</a>, part of an FAA effort to study uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) traffic management (UTM) technology.</p>\n    <p>The Israeli firm also serves customers in Granbury, Texas, and a pair of North Carolina towns. It said Thursday that its drones have completed more than 200,000 U.S. deliveries—fewer than Wing but more than Amazon’s Prime Air offering.</p>\n    <h2>Uber Gets In On Drones</h2>\n    <p>Like DoorDash, whose automation unit is exploring new ways to deliver, Uber Eats too has experimented with novel technology. Since 2021, it has worked with sidewalk delivery robot company Serve Robotics, which is <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/self-flying-drones-self-driving-robots-combine-to-deliver-in-dallas/\">exploring an integration</a> with Wing’s drones. But its collaboration with Flytrex marks its first drone delivery investment.</p>\n    <p>“With Flytrex, we’re entering the next chapter—bringing the speed and sustainability of drone delivery to the Uber Eats platform, at scale, for the first time,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s president of autonomous mobility and delivery, in a <a href=\"https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2025/Uber-Partners-with-Flytrex-to-Launch-Drone-Delivery/default.aspx\">statement</a>.</p>\n    <p>Uber said customers will receive orders from Flytrex drones “in minutes.” The UAS fly autonomously at low altitude and about 30 knots, capable of covering about 5 sm round trip. They can carry up to 6.6 pounds of chicken wings, ice cream, or other goodies, though future models could raise that capacity to 8.8 pounds. Orders are lowered via a tether directly to the customer’s backyard.</p>\n    <p>Flytrex is one of a handful of U.S. drone delivery providers with Part 135 air carrier permissions and an FAA exemption that authorizes beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations, whereas other providers must maintain direct human oversight of their aircraft. That means, at least from a regulatory standpoint, there are few hurdles in the way of Uber Eats’ drone delivery launch.</p>\n    <p>“Autonomous drones are the future of food delivery—fast, affordable, and hands-free,” said Noam Bardin, executive chairman of Flytrex. “Together, we’re building the infrastructure for a future where autonomous systems seamlessly move goods through our communities, making faster, safer, and more sustainable delivery the new standard.”</p>\n    <p>Flytrex in June launched its Dallas-Fort Worth-area service, which is available to about 100,000 residents and expected to expand. As the services grow more common, they may soon also become more robust.</p>\n    <p>The FAA in August unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/breaking-down-the-bvlos-drone-proposal/\">long-awaited proposal</a> for a new Part 108. The rule would effectively standardize regulations for BVLOS flight by replacing the exemption process with more robust operating certificates, tiered based on risk. It would also permit commercial drone operations in controlled Class B, C, and D airspace, among other measures. Industry trade groups such as the Commercial Drone Alliance have lauded the proposal.</p>\n    <p>The push to unlock commercial drones extends all the way to the White House, which in June published an <a href=\"https://www.flyingmag.com/white-house-order-aims-to-boost-new-generation-of-u-s-aircraft/\">executive order</a> directing federal agencies to relax UAS operational restrictions. The order also calls for new privileges for domestic drone manufacturers that aim to get the technology in the hands of the military and international customers.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Like this story?

    "body": "<p>All products and listings featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n<p>By 1 p.m., Ali Thani restaurant is already crowded. Lids lifted off stainless steel food trays release clouds of steam scented with tamarind, cardamom, and cloves. As usual I order mutafay, a fresh tuna and tamarind curry, along with fluffy white rice and the fried fish of the day. Mutafay is traditionally made by families here in Muttrah, one of the oldest neighborhoods in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-a-road-trip-through-oman-navigating-grief-and-parenthood\">Muscat, Oman</a>’s thinly spread coastal capital, and Ali Thani—a fixture on the restaurant scene—is the place to try it. I join other diners tucking into the food using their fingers.</p>\n<p>“Muttrah is where different traditions and flavors converge,” says my friend Abdullah Al Lawati, whose family comes from the area. “From the sour notes of dried limes and tamarind to fish—especially my favorite, mahi mahi, which I love in homemade fish burgers and lumi curries.” Qabooli, a spiced rice dish often flecked with fatty flakes of lamb, plump raisins, and cashew nuts, garnished with coriander leaves and ruby pomegranate seeds, goes well with a side of tomato-chili salsa.</p>\n<p>The spread of foods crowding my table at Ali Thani represents Oman’s cosmopolitan history as a seafaring superpower and offers an insight into its population’s ebb and flow. Another local favorite recipe, paplou (a turmeric-citrus fish broth), is thought to pay homage to the Al Lawatiya tribe who came to Oman from Sindh in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/pakistan-mustafa-hasan-locals-guide\">Pakistan</a> centuries ago and whose descendants still live in a walled quarter behind Muscat’s corniche in what remains a semi-closed, curious enclave.</p>\n<p>Cut off from the Arabian Peninsula by a sea of sand on its land border, Oman relied on its long coastline for trade, with sailings to <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/18-months-on-the-persian-royal-road-felt-like-a-second-childhood\">Persia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-time-to-visit-india\">India</a>, and as far as <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-a-trip-to-chinas-countryside-finding-connection-in-an-unexpected-place\">China</a> by the 15th century. After the <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/meeting-artists-creatives-on-a-road-trip-through-portugal\">Portuguese</a> invaded Muscat in 1507, the Yemenis, Ottomans, and Persians took turns controlling parts of the country’s straggling coast. Oman then defeated the Portuguese and went on, in 1698, to control the East African coast from Mogadishu to <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/in-mozambique-marine-conservation-has-helped-shape-a-different-kind-of-safari\">Mozambique</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/best-time-to-visit-zanzibar\">Zanzibar</a>, bringing migration, marriage, and a mixing of culinary traditions.</p>\n<p>While my mother’s and father’s families are from Oman and Zanzibar respectively, I grew up in Portsmouth and spent my childhood summer vacations in Muscat, trying not to feel out of place. Since then, food has given me a better understanding of what it means to be Omani. On countless trips across the sultanate, I’ve tried to work out what defines Omani cuisine, only to find diversity and difference. Dining out here is stripped back and real, but the experience is consistently welcoming.</p>\n<p>In 1964, Zanzibar’s revolution forced some Omanis there to flee to towns in Oman, such as Seeb, where residents, including my grandmother, Bibi, still remember their island past. “In the ‘70s and ’80s it was so easy to travel around Muscat and not even speak Arabic, so many people were speaking Swahili,” she tells me. “Our food was the best, and so new that everyone wanted to eat it.” Beyond the sun-faded red-and-white-striped awnings of Seeb’s Africa Restaurant and Coffee Shop, dishes are presented behind glass screens and patrons place orders through circular cut-outs. I pick a little of everything, Zanzibari style, including creamed spinach, cardamom bread, and sweet potato ice cream.</p>\n<p>Most Omanis still get together over the dinner table at home, which means restaurants are simple, local affairs. The white-linen treatment is strictly reserved for hotel restaurants such as <a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/en-us/dining/restaurant-bar/mctxr-the-st-regis-al-mouj-muscat-resort/6958488-karibu.mi\">Karibu</a> in the newly opened <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/53NXSZk29WKfLeJG7ATLCGP8seB7RkiEdJBWf6e6PmTkU18z87jHSY9vGAv8dQVmmAGWnFaacxCKqMu6tdhmQKYhidHZzSDc2huyMzmHNqvtrteRjiuHKZoZGYQncKnoJyYCsxyPdCcnJT5utDYPmpnLmmALjxHcL4eoEmWyuc6iYU45AwBw3V8PBcuLmKkw4xfpc3HhP7euj6dP9G4Y56sMmyybTZoy62RJgJpnrBP7dGBBZ6c2XQmiowLqJmSC2DLQ2uRkfdLnBjhE8EWF13DgvBounMtnK5ozQ5gkxsNbqUMA4UdGKcP58VeHpJcubNrV8fg4Uyi4D8KyBmDArTd3wRWAwbfnSDXjfEH5e68HCN3dxJxYFXtZiqiESkoN\">St Regis Al Mouj Muscat Resort</a>, which plays on Oman’s spice route links with a menu of Zanzibari, Indian, and local dishes. From a central oven the chef paddles out crisp, thin flatbreads perfectly designed for scooping up cold mezze dips decorated with flower petals, pine nuts or pomegranate seeds. The Omani-style mishkak, or meat skewers, are spiced with cinnamon rather than chili, and the coconut-infused cuisine includes kingfish served with mussels.</p>\n<p>Tastes change with the scenery on my three-hour drive into the Hajar Mountains to the fort city of Nizwa and then on to the centuries-old, mud-brick settlement of Misfah Al Abriyeen, a UN Tourism village that sits above a dark green seam of palms. I’m here to buy the local beekeepers’ sidr honey, which is poured onto qeliah, a dish of slow-cooked meat steeped in date vinegar and served with crepe-like regag bread. My friend’s grandmother, Bibi Moza, uses freshly ground peppercorns, coriander seeds, and cumin to spice the lamb for qeliah, but insists honey is the essential ingredient. “The floral sweet notes with the slow-cooked meat is what makes the recipe,” she tells me. Qeliah is often eaten during <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-american-chefs-are-celebrating-eid\">Eid</a> al-Fitr, the celebration marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Communities in Nizwa gather around smouldering firepits or tanoor ovens to cook shuwa: lamb, goat, and, occasionally, camel meat that is marinated in spices for up to 48 hours before being parceled up in banana leaves and date palm sacks. By the second or third day, the slow-cooked meat is darkly encrusted with nutmeg, cinnamon, chili, and other spices and falls off the bone.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/the-colorful-and-complex-world-of-omani-cuisine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Listen to hear Lale sit down with her former co-host, close friend, and co-founder of the podcast <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ohheytheremere/?hl=en\">Meredith Carey</a>. Plenty of ground is covered—from the perks and pitfalls of <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/golden-rules-of-solo-travel\">solo travel</a>, to their favorite past guests, how they've grown as travelers, and why the podcast is still as relevant today as it was when it began in 2017.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/womenwhotravel/\">Instagram</a> for what's to come next for us—and make sure to <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/newsletter/women-who-travel\">sign up for our newsletter</a> for the latest Women Who Travel stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Lale Arikoglu:</strong> Hi there, I'm Lale Arikoglu and this is a very special episode of Women Who Travel. As September winds up and the year comes to a close, we are going on hiatus. So what better guests to have on than my very dear friend and a familiar name and voice to any long time listener, it's Meredith Carey, who was my co-host for many years on this podcast and started it with me in 2017.</p>\n<p>I've spent the last three years hosting this podcast by myself, and it has grown exponentially. We've had so many astonishing guests with astonishing stories to tell, had everyone from <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-i-travel-tracee-ellis-ross\">Tracee Ellis Ross</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/brooke-shields-iqaluit\">Brooke Shields</a>, and so many more inspiring travelers in between. But it all began just me and Meredith in a makeshift studio in the World Trade Center before Condé Nast even had a podcast department.</p>\n<p>I can't quite describe how surreal it is to have you back in the studio, Mere.</p>\n<p><strong>Meredith Carey</strong> It feels so wild, and also we just recorded the last episode that I was with you yesterday.</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Yes. And it was in fact almost four years ago. This podcast was relaunched after your departure three years ago. So much has happened in the world since then.</p>\n<p><strong>MC:</strong> So much.</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> But before we dive into all things pod, I want listeners who might be new to the podcast to kind of know a bit about you and also how we know each other.</p>\n<p><strong>MC:</strong> We met like, oh, 11, 12 years ago. Lale was my boss when I was an intern at a weekly newspaper. It was like pure chaos and she was a lighthouse in the storm, and-</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> I want to jump in and say to really capture the chaos, I was a 24-year-old boss. I shouldn't have been a boss.</p>\n<p><strong>MC:</strong> We were but a few years apart. But yeah, we were on this crazy journey together. And then I went and graduated from college and Lale was still in <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-things-to-do-in-new-york\">New York</a> and we kept in touch. And then when she was looking for a job, she reached out. We started working together at <i>Traveler</i>. And then when we were thinking about just women who travel in general, we were like, \"Oh, we have so much to say because we say a lot to each other. Why don't we say it on a microphone?\"</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> Before there was even a podcast, there was a Facebook group, now 150,000 or so community members strong who swapped travel stories and ideas and tips and really were the inspiration for this podcast. How the women who Travel Universe was kind of born as a whole was after the 2016 election. There was all this energy drummed up for women's rights, and yet in the travel space, it didn't feel like we were being spoken to in the way that other parts of media were. And we jumped on it.</p>\n<p><strong>MC:</strong> We were having all these conversations in the office all the time about our concerns, about our questions, about our travel queries. And we figured if we're having these conversations, other women who are really passionate about travel are probably having them with their friends too, and they're just not happening in public, and we're missing all of this knowledge sharing by not getting to hear it.</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> And I think when you say knowledge sharing, when you first think of women and traveling and their concerns, it's like safety, but it's also about acknowledging the nuances of people's lived experiences and finding ways of traveling that fits those or speaks to those.</p>\n<p><strong>MC:</strong> And I think even when you talk about safety, safety means a different thing to every person who's going and living this life and out in the world. And so to get to hear from different women who have different concerns, who are traveling with a family, who are traveling with a spouse, who are traveling on their own, who have different passions that intersect with travel, people could see themselves, we could see ourselves in what they were doing. And I think that was really exciting at the time too.</p>\n<p><strong>LA:</strong> We obviously did a lot of brainstorms at the beginning, but we also had no idea how to make a podcast. There was not a podcast studio at Condé Nast. I will say it was a conference room with some foam boards.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cntraveler.com/story/women-who-travel-podcast-an-old-friend-returns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Would you do it?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>These companies are giving their employees extra paid time off if they forego flights in favor of travel by land or sea. Would you do it?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There’s a new trend in employee benefits in the UK, and it’s a snazzy one: Over 160 companies are now offering their employees extra paid time off if they commit to avoid flying to their vacation destination.</p>\n    <p>This extra PTO—one to two days per year—comes standard for employees at companies that have joined a corporate membership scheme called <a href=\"https://www.climateperks.com/\">Climate Perks</a>. The goal isn’t to reward employees for not traveling, but to help compensate for the extra time it takes to <a href=\"https://adventure.com/no-fly-rail-train-adventure-europe-asia/\">travel by train</a>, bus, or ferry than by air.</p>\n    <p>“At Climate Perks, we believe you shouldn’t have to sacrifice your precious annual leave to choose clean travel,” the organization says in a slide deck laying out its <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c7fea2394d71a89e8e2bf98/t/68652889806d5b34bea92ba7/1751459978728/Perks-Overview.pdf\">benefits and impact</a>. So far, an estimated 2,500 tons of CO2—roughly the equivalent of driving around the Earth 20,000 times—has been avoided by employees choosing cleaner travel thanks to Climate Perks.</p>\n    <p>Brits fly more than residents of any other country except for the US and China, even though the UK is well-connected to Europe by ferry and undersea railway. About two-thirds of Brits say they’d prefer to fly less for environmental reasons, but according to Climate Perks, they’re often forced to choose flights. Why? Because cleaner transit takes too long.</p>\n    <p>By joining for a modest, pay-what-you-can annual fee, member companies get access to language and documentation they can use to update their employee handbooks and corporate policies, making it easier to implement. Employees also get discounts from companies like the flight-free Byway, which offers long-distance rail journeys through Europe using the Interrail Pass, and Canopy &amp; Stars, an Airbnb alternative for cabins, glamping, and remote destinations.</p>\n    <p>Offering perks for being a better environmental steward isn’t exclusive to the workplace.  Last year, the city of <a href=\"https://adventure.com/overtourism-travel-tourism-solutions-what-the-experts-say/\">Copenhagen</a> launched Copenpay, a tourist ‘rewards’ program. Dozens of local businesses offered free or discounted drinks, meals, activities, and museum tickets to tourists who showed evidence of specific clean deeds, such as traveling by bike or public transit, or volunteering to help clean up litter around the city.</p>\n    <p>It worked, evidently extremely well: During the pilot for Copenpay, bike rentals in Copenhagen went up 29 percent, <a href=\"https://skift.com/2025/09/03/copenhagen-turns-sustainability-into-a-tourist-perk-more-than-100-cities-are-watching/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20%7C%20The%20Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-mTJW9Mxjm8yPjYSHNegDafgRYqAtYyKN6QqTqcSEsJOZSOj0jbBSdSQsGUctu6RF7dHEeDO3TdZstW0KfSUkCLsI0A&amp;_hsmi=378934393&amp;utm_content=378942284&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">according to Skift</a>. More than 100 cities around the world have since been in touch with the city’s tourism board, Wonderful Copenhagen, to ask for advice on how to repeat the program themselves.</p>\n    <p>Right now, it’s a seasonal program for summer tourists, but they hope to eventually make it a year-round program, Rikke Holm Petersen, director of marketing at Wonderful Copenhagen, told Skift. “My dream is that we could have it all year round.”<br/>\n</p>\n    <p>While the EU is reportedly <a href=\"https://ftnnews.com/travel-news/rail/eu-reopens-debate-on-banning-short-flights-with-train-alternatives/\">re-opening debate</a> about <a href=\"https://adventure.com/spain-short-haul-flights-trains/\">short-haul flight bans</a> such as those enacted by Spain and France, rail journeys have increased worldwide even without such mandates. Combined with more British companies joining Climate Perks, this could signal a <a href=\"https://skift.com/2025/08/28/would-you-trade-flying-for-extra-time-off-these-companies-offer-slow-travel-incentives/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20%7C%20The%20Daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mlJDrzxy7ijSNzpDpiqtEpSAvIt3wyd6SRvwdiUFzcCqn9cZdSN5w8AevXsgVbLIPxix3bIGubDM0v4ADnKrdMN94Hg&amp;_hsmi=378093060&amp;utm_content=378095349&amp;utm_source=hs_email\">broader trend</a> about travelers’ commitment to cleaner travel, according to Skift.</p>\n    <p>Last year, Amtrak—the national train service for the US—reported a 15 percent increase in riders, <a href=\"https://media.amtrak.com/2024/12/amtrak-sets-all-time-ridership-record-in-fiscal-year-2024/\">setting an all-time record</a>. Eurostar also transported a record number of passengers, and has ordered 50 new trains to increase capacity.</p>\n    <p>New train routes and sleeper services have debuted across the world, too, as there seems to be a renaissance of train travel. Last year, Mexico completed a 966-mile (1,554-kilometer) <a href=\"https://adventure.com/tren-maya-railway-travel-yucatan-peninsula-mexico/\">train route around the Yucatán Peninsula</a>. This summer, Amtrak finally reopened rail service between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, where tracks had been destroyed by Hurricane Katrina about 20 years ago.</p>\n    <p>Climate Perks is UK-based, and for now, most member companies seem to be sustainability- or travel-focused, including the John Muir Trust, Byway, and Much Better Adventures. But that doesn’t mean other companies shouldn’t get on board, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, it appears to be a wise employee retention tool. A Deloitte survey that found 70 percent of Millennials and Gen Z workers will <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/purpose-over-paychecks-gen-z-millennials-xej0f/\">consider a company’s sustainability practices</a> when they’re deciding between jobs. </p>\n    <p>But it’s not just current and prospective employees who might view brands more positively if they prove, as Climate Perks members do, that they’re working to remove barriers to making more sustainable choices. It’s also a signal to prospective clients—and that’s just good business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>***\n</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Kassondra Cloos is a travel journalist from Rhode Island living in London, and Adventure.com's news and gear writer.

Arthur, yellowed newspaper clippings of Truman’s swearing-in, glossy magazine covers of Ronald Reagan and his wife, campaign posters from elections past, and life-size cutouts of JFK and Abraham Lincoln. Countless flags hang from the ceiling, and the walls form a patchwork of badges, banners, and political curiosities. </p>\n<p>The man behind it all is Mike Driscoll, a former social studies teacher who, after a couple of years in the classroom, decided it wasn’t for him and set out to buy a bar.  </p>\n<p>He settled on an 1874 building, once a livery stable with a blacksmith’s quarters, to pour his passion for U.S. history into what would become a Buffalo institution. </p>\n<p>His incredible collection began in 1985, when he was still teaching and gathering posters, portraits, and other ephemera. When the bar opened, it contained a third of what it does today. The memorabilia soon became a communal project: over the years, patrons would bring over objects found in dusty basements and flea markets. The collection grew so vast it eventually spilled beyond the bar, with parts now stored at Driscoll’s house.</p>\n<p>The aim of this space isn’t to spark political debates, but rather to highlight history and to test cultural knowledge. Since opening in 1986, Driscoll has kept his teaching spirit alive by quizzing visitors from behind the bar. And every Tuesday of the month, the pub presents a trivia night. Winners can hope to win anything ranging from a candy bar to a $10 gift certificate. But beware, the questions are much tougher than your average trivia. (Example: What is the only state that ends with a K?)</p>\n<p>Listed as one of the 18 best bars in America by Esquire magazine, the establishment attracts people from all over the country. Customers often end up quizzing each other on their home states, perpetuating the bar’s mission. </p>\n<p>While you brush up on your U.S. history, you can do it over a pint of Liberty Lager or Patriot Porter, often brewed with ingredients authentic to the tastes of a past era. You can also enjoy an Independence Burger, for which you’re at liberty to pile on anything you want. </p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/founding-fathers-pub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Arriving at the <a href=\"https://www.fairmont.com/en/hotels/puerto-rico/fairmont-el-san-juan-hotel.html\">Fairmont El San Juan Hotel</a>, a sunswept resort on Puerto Rico’s northern coast, I immediately knew that I was somewhere special. Just inside the front door, a dazzling 7,000-piece crystal chandelier hung above a sunken bar where bowtie-clad bartenders crafted tropical cocktails, recreating the aura of a more refined era of luxury. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/amygordon/\">Amy Gordon</a>Sep 17, 2025</p>\n<p>Since this storied resort first opened its doors in 1958, it’s always been one of the chicest destinations in the Caribbean. Over the years, superstars from Frank Sinatra to Jennifer Lopez to Bad Bunny have performed at the nightclub, Brava, and the resort has hosted countless famous faces in its luxe guest rooms and butler-serviced private villas.</p>\n<p>I’m no celebrity, but throughout my stay, I felt just as important as the highest-profile guest. Every staff member I interacted with seemed intent on making me feel like a VIP from check-in to check-out. As soon as I entered the lobby, I was greeted with a welcome cocktail made with fresh hibiscus, Puerto Rico’s national flower, and escorted to my room by a cheerful hotel representative who pointed out the property’s highlights on the way. I was awed by the 300-year-old Banyan tree with its massive cascading roots, and I made a mental note to check the yoga schedule at the three-story, state-of-the-art fitness center.</p>\n<p>Photo: Amy Gordon</p>\n<p>As my guide left me to get settled, she handed me a wooden keycard, a tangible expression of the hotel’s commitment to eco-consciousness and sustainability. Additional touches like paper straws, refillable toiletries, water-bottle-filling stations, and biodegradable to-go utensils made me feel confident that I was staying somewhere that values our environment as much as I do.</p>\n<p>With 13 food and beverage outlets on the property, the hardest part of my day was deciding where to eat. I began each morning by indulging in the massive buffet packed with fresh pastries, eggs, meats and cheeses, cookies, fruit, and a seemingly endless array of <i>quesitos</i> (cream-cheese-filled pastries), <i>besitos de coco</i> (a Puerto Rican take on coconut macaroons), and other local favorites. On my Uber driver’s recommendation, I stopped into Candy Shoppe, where the clerk served up rich Belgian chocolate and hot Puerto Rican coffee. For lunch, I opted to dine poolside on sandwiches and snacks at the El San Juan Beach Club as I took a break from the sun in a private cabana. </p>\n<p>Photo: Amy Gordon</p>\n<p>Four distinctive pools dot the 388-room property, each with its own vibe and amenities, whether that’s tranquil fountains or swim-up bars. My favorite touch was the server walking around with a pushcart full of fruity popsicles, the perfect mid-afternoon refresher. If you’re more of a beach bum than a pool patron, just walk through a gate and you’re a few sandy steps from the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p>While Fairmont El San Juan Hotel feels like a private oasis, it sits just five minutes from San Juan International Airport (SJU) and 20 minutes from picture-perfect <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/old-san-juan-food/\">Old San Juan</a>, a must-visit on any trip to Puerto Rico. After spending the morning walking the blue cobblestone streets and touring historic landmarks like El Morro and the Puerta de San Juan gate, I returned to the hotel ready to relax with a deep-tissue massage. I checked in for my afternoon appointment at the penthouse Well &amp; Being Spa, and I strolled out an hour later refreshed, relaxed, and excited for an unforgettable evening.</p>\n<p>Photo: Amy Gordon</p>\n<p>Dinner at Fairmont El San Juan Hotel is a treat no matter which outlet you choose, from exquisite omakase at Sushi by Bou, to cocktails and steaks at Meat Market, to modern interpretations of traditional Puerto Rican fare at Caña. I chatted with Caña’s James Beard-recognized Chef Jose Enrique, who shared stories about growing up nearby and sneaking into the hotel to see the famous musicians that came through regularly. Listening to his nostalgic trip down memory lane, I felt the hotel’s significance not just to the island but to its people.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights at Fairmont El San Juan Hotel, after dinner is when the real action begins. The lobby becomes a destination for unforgettable, locally inspired entertainment and interactive experiences. While I was on property, there was an invite-only fashion show, a vibrant salsa band wowing the crowd at Chico Cabaret, gamers and gamblers living it up in the attached Foxwoods Casino, and a lobby full of glamorous locals and worldly guests. My favorite evening activity, however, was the Cultural Canvas Series, where I not only got to showcase my (very limited) painting skills and artistic flair but also meet a local artist from Puerto Rico’s thriving creative community.</p>\n<p>Photo: Amy Gordon</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/fairmont-el-san-juan-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Families from Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean, are all part of this vibrant community. </p>\n<p>Seeing the rich variety of textiles worn by women in its streets, Hoeg saw an opportunity to create a communal space around them. </p>\n<p>In 2014, that vision came to fruition with the creation of Stitch Buffalo, a textile art center where refugee and immigrant women can sell their handcrafted goods, alongside communal classes and a thrift store of textile supplies. Its mission: stitching communities together.</p>\n<p>It started as an embroidery workshop attended by one refugee woman. Today, over 200 refugee women and families receive free sewing equipment, supplies, and training each year. </p>\n<p>The organization recently changed buildings, moving into a renovated former factory. Stepping in, visitors are greeted by an open space full of joy and bright colors. </p>\n<p>The first stop for visitors is the store, where they can explore products created through the Refugee Women’s Workshop. Products include hand-woven totes, crocheted shoulder bags, embroidered pillows, and beaded jewelry. Most are one-of-a-kind, informed by women’s past training as artists, the culture they come from, and the styles worn back home. People can also bring their clothes to have them altered by Stitch Buffalo’s artisans.</p>\n<p>Just behind the store is the Second Stitch Program, a sustainability initiative where more than 20,000 pounds of textile art tools and supplies and over 200 sewing machines find a second life each year. When not used in the Refugee Women’s Workshop or during classes, these materials are available at a discount for crafty people to browse. </p>\n<p>Past the thrift shop are the community workshop spaces, where visitors can try embroidery, dyeing, sewing and weaving–often taught by refugee and immigrant women who practice their English as they share their craft. </p>\n<p>The organization just completed a giant mural that wraps around the building. Created over 18 months with deep community input, it features textile tools, fabrics, and shapes iconic to Stitch Buffalo. It embodies the diverse community that makes West Side Buffalo such a special place. </p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stitch-buffalo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For a century, the missing first portion of Mark Twain’s manuscript was believed to have been destroyed by a printer. In truth, it had been sitting quietly in the basement of the granddaughter of James Fraser Gluck, the Buffalo Library curator who persuaded Twain to donate the draft in 1885. </p>\n<p>That discovery reunited the manuscript in full at the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library in 1992. It led to the creation of an entire room dedicated to Samuel Clemens, better known to the world as Mark Twain, America’s great humorist and literary revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Today, the <a href=\"https://www.buffalolib.org/special-collections/mark-twain-room\">Mark Twain Room</a> resembles a cabinet of curiosities, with more than 500 pieces of Twain memorabilia sprinkled throughout. There are cigars and playing cards stamped with his face, portraits, rare editions, and the restored mantel from Twain and his wife Olivia’s home in Buffalo, where he once worked as a newspaper editor. Visitors can also learn about his venture into invention: the “Memory Builder,” a board game he patented in 1892 after watching his daughter struggle to remember historical dates. And there’s even the trunk in which the manuscript was found, now resting beneath the fireplace mantel.</p>\n<p>The heart of the collection is, of course, the Huckleberry Finn manuscript itself, often dubbed one of the greatest American novels and still the subject of debate today. Only two pages are displayed at a time, rotating monthly in the climate-controlled room. Twain's edits sprawl across the margins, his words scratched out, revised, and made “folksier” as he worked to capture a new American literary voice: realism. To stand in front of the manuscript feels like stepping inside his train of thought.</p>\n<p>Twice a year, the exhibition changes, exploring themes like “Twain in Hollywood.” Beyond this room, the library holds other marvels: an unpublished Louisa May Alcott poem, a medieval manuscript collection, a letter written by Charlotte Brontë, and a rare complete set of Shakespeare's 17th-century folios. </p>\n<p>Such riches reflect Buffalo’s standing during the Gilded Age. The city's main street, Delaware Avenue—known as Millionaires’ Row—was lined with the mansions of leading industrialists, and Twain himself. The residue of that lavish era lives on in the treasures of the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library, a town square of culture and arts that was fundamental to the city's cultural development.</p>\n\n\n                \n            </div>\n\n              </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-mark-twain-room\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>If you can believe it, I grew up in Southern California and went to college in the Bay Area but never made my way to Sonoma County for wine tastings. A few years back, I ventured on a weekend getaway to Temecula in the Greater Los Angeles Area and got a feel for what I imagined wine country would be like, but I didn’t really have an excuse to go — until recently, when I found myself staying at two very different properties in Sonoma County: a boutique hotel in downtown Healdsburg and a wellness-oriented retreat in nearby Forestville.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/christinaberkegmail-com/\">Christina Berke</a>Sep 17, 2025</p>\n<h2>For a boutique experience with a big personality: 27 North</h2>\n<p>Photos: Christina Berke</p>\n<p>My journey to Sonoma County started with a short plane ride from Los Angeles to Santa Rosa. I was picked up by <a href=\"https://www.hotel27north.com/\">27 North</a>’s Oliver in a Volvo SUV with a panoramic sunroof for a short and scenic ride to Healdsburg, complete with wild turkeys and bursting vineyards. There’s a bookish warmth you feel when you walk into the hotel, and I was pleased with the welcome drink, a hibiscus tea with (or without) the housemade tequila, El Mexicano. </p>\n<p>Though my journey wasn’t long, travel days can still take something out of me. The second I got settled into my room, I sank into the fluffiest bed, almost as if it sighed along with me. I kicked off my shoes, turned on the gas fireplace with a flick of a switch, and flipped through the local <i>SF Modern Luxury</i> magazine while I enjoyed a cup of local Russian River Tea Company tea. </p>\n<p>My room was spacious — bigger than the apartment I lived in years ago in New York. I loved the 19th-century antique armoire, the faux balcony windows, and the extravagant four-poster bedframe. The attention to detail was incredible, like the well-appointed mirrors featuring tiny birds, flowers, and butterflies that gave it a lightly feminine touch.</p>\n<p>If you must work from your room, you can feel fancy sitting at the leather-top desk with vintage books held together by bronze lions. The hotel’s L’Occitane bath products finish off the elegance, along with homemade lavender bath salts. Soak in the jet tub and enjoy the view — in my case, local art from Terry Sauvé that delivered a gorgeous setting sun overlooking the vineyards. In fact, the hotel is filled with art from other locals, like Bradford Brenner’s lulling florals and Berisford’s modern It’s-It ice cream pieces.</p>\n<p>Luckily, I didn’t have to grab a Lyft to get dinner as the property has a restaurant, Arandas, right downstairs. Wednesday night is Rock Like a Banshee — bring your own collection of records, or listen to the DJ spin some classics while you enjoy happy hour with a Savoia Spritz Slushie to cool off or the prickly pear margarita. Happy hour (Thursday and Friday between 4 and 6 PM and Saturday and Sunday between 3 and 6 PM) offers classic margs for $5 each plus light bites like queso fundido ($10), coconut shrimp tacos (2 for $10), and quesabirria (2 for $10).</p>\n<p>Photos: Christina Berke</p>\n<p>For dinner, get the carnitas bowl: slow-cooked, citrus-marinated pork on a plate filled with the most delicious <i>frijoles de olla</i> (slow-cooked beans), perfectly cooked and flavorful Spanish rice, guacamole, and crema. Be sure to ask for the in-house hot sauce. Though I was full, I had to go with the can’t-miss recommendation for dessert: the churros. I don’t order them often because I’ve found that churros can be greasy or stale, but the texture of the cinnamon-sugar crunch against the soft warmth of the freshly fried dough was mind-blowing. </p>\n<p>The churros come with a side of chocolate and caramel sauce (and cute fresh flowers for decor), but my server Jess suggested dipping the dessert in the horchata mudslide. It’s like an adult milkshake with tequila blanco, Two Stacks Irish Cream, Evil Bean Coffee Liqueur, horchata whip, and Abuelita Chocolate ($15). Thirsty for a little more, I also had to try the hotel’s craft cocktails and would recommend mixologist Matt “Mellow” Sykes’s La Mujer Florero: vodka, velvet falernum, strawberry Campari, lemon, and grapefruit.</p>\n<p>Before heading to bed, I wanted to check out the library I passed on the way in. As a bookworm, I practically swooned at the vintage editions of Charles Dickens, a collection of poetry, an early edition <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and Harvard Classics series of hardcovers. Sitting there, I felt a bit like Southern lifestyle blogger Millennial Belle with the dim lights, lo-fi music, and a glass of Malbec.</p>\n<p>Breakfast at the hotel is grab-n-go, perfect for those off to explore the town. Grab a pear, a coffee with plenty of assorted milk options, and a muffin. If you’re here on the weekend, treat yourself to brunch instead. I’m not a sweet breakfast diner, but I listened to my server’s suggestion and went for the Brioche French Toast, served with fresh strawberries and horchata whipped cream. Get a side of the crispiest bacon and insanely well-seasoned breakfast potatoes.</p>\n<p>With just 16 rooms, 27 North is like the Goldilocks hotel: intimate but not too quiet. Rooms start at $400 per night, and California residents can enjoy 20 percent off plus a complimentary bottle of local wine.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/%E2%80%9Chttps:/www.hotel27north.com/%22\">Book Now</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>For quiet luxury in the redwoods: Farmhouse Inn</h2>\n<p>Photos: Christina Berke</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/where-to-stay-in-sonoma-county/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For more than a decade, I’ve made a career out of moving through cities—sometimes chasing breaking news, other times following the quiet hum of a new city. But there’s something about arriving in New York over a holiday weekend that feels electric, as if the city itself is leaning into the long pause right alongside you. Over Labor Day, I checked into the New York Marriott Marquis, the <a href=\"https://booking.stay22.com/matadornetwork/8v5DnPpA4h\">towering property in the heart of Times Square</a>, to see how a classic Manhattan stay might redefine the way I approach long weekends.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://booking.stay22.com/matadornetwork/8v5DnPpA4h\">Booking.com</a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/author/dominiquematadornetwork-com/\">Dominique Jackson</a>Sep 17, 2025</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/hotels-near-jfk-airport/\">Touching down at JFK</a>, I knew better than to wrestle with yellow cab queues or app-based rideshares. Over the years, I’ve learned that the first moments in a new city can set the tone for an entire trip. Plus, I’d decided to go all-in on this trip and make it both posh and easy. So I booked a Blacklane ride—a service I’ve come to rely on when I want both reliability and comfort. My chauffeur was waiting with a crisp sign, a welcoming smile, and a smooth ride into Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Sliding into the leather interior of a Blacklane vehicle has become one of those small rituals of luxury for me, the kind that tells me I’ve truly arrived. Watching the skyline sharpen from the backseat, coffee in hand, I was able to slip into New York on my own terms—unrushed, unbothered, and already at ease.<br/>\n        </p>\n<p>We hope you love the New York Marriott Marquis!

For some, Times Square is too much—too many screens, too much noise. But if you’ve ever wanted to be in the gravitational pull of the city, this is the place. From my room on the 18th floor, the city glowed beneath me in real time: the billboards, the cabs, the never-quieting stream of people.</p>\n<p>The hotel’s centrality is its secret weapon. In one weekend I managed to walk to the Museum of Modern Art, stroll through Central Park, and be seated for dinner downtown without ever feeling far from my base. For travelers looking to maximize time over a holiday, the Marquis’ location is as quintessential New York as it gets.</p>\n<h2>Rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://booking.stay22.com/matadornetwork/8v5DnPpA4h\">Booking.com</a></p>\n<p>The Marriott Marquis is unapologetically big – the 51-story building houses some 1,970 rooms. Unlike so many New York hotel rooms, the rooms here reflect the grand stature of the property. My double king room was a reprieve from the city’s density: floor-to-ceiling windows framing Times Square, plush bedding, and enough square footage to remind me I wasn’t in a shoebox boutique hotel. My guest for the weekend—my mom—gave it her stamp of approval, and if it passes the mom test, you know it’s legit.</p>\n<p>The design leaned modern without losing warmth—neutral tones, clean lines, and a workspace that made catching up on a few assignments surprisingly pleasant. One of the unexpected perks was the soundproofing. For all the chaos of Times Square outside, my room felt cocooned in quiet. After a day of traversing the city, I appreciated that silence.</p>\n<h2>Design &amp; atmosphere at the New York Marriott Marquis</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://booking.stay22.com/matadornetwork/8v5DnPpA4h\">Booking.com</a></p>\n<p>The lobby is a swirl of movement—guests checking in, Broadway fans ducking into the hotel’s theater entrances, families clustering by the glass elevators. Rising 49 stories, the hotel’s design is anchored by its massive atrium, a cavernous vertical space that channels the same drama as the city itself.</p>\n<p>It’s not the understated minimalism you’ll find in boutique properties downtown. Instead, the Marriott Marquis leans into its scale. The design is about theater, about seeing and being seen, about amplifying the energy of Times Square rather than shrinking from it.</p>\n<h2>M Club Access</h2>\n<p>Photo: <a href=\"https://booking.stay22.com/matadornetwork/8v5DnPpA4h\">Booking.com</a></p>\n<p>One of the highlights of my stay was access to the M Club, the Marriott Marquis’ exclusive lounge for elite members and select guests. Tucked away from the bustle, the lounge offered daily breakfast with fresh pastries, fruit, and espresso strong enough to power you through the long weekend. In the evenings, it became a haven for light refreshments and desserts.</p>\n<p>For me, the M Club was less about the food and more about the atmosphere: an intimate perch above the fray where I could watch the city without having to fight my way through it. For travelers squeezing every ounce out of a long weekend, this access adds measurable value—time saved, comfort gained.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://matadornetwork.com/read/new-york-marriott-marquis-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><graphic src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2025/northsweden1.jpg\" alt=\"The view overlooking northern sweden on a bright and sunny summer day\"/><br/>\nThere’s nothing like <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/\">Sweden</a> in the summer. Light hangs in the air for hours, boats nose through island-studded bays, and cafés spill onto sidewalks as Swedes take advantage of the fleeting warm weather. </p>\n<p>With so much of the year spent in the cold and dark, the never-ending light that summer brings does not go to waste. Whether it’s on the many islands that dot the country’s coast, at their rustic cabins in the woods, or lounging in the city parks, Swedes flock outdoors.</p>\n<p>I’ve been to Sweden many times (including spending an entire summer in Stockholm) but have always focused on the southern part of the country. However, with a desire to see something different this visit, I decided to explore the north, starting at the top in Luleå and working my day down.</p>\n<p>If you want to get off the beaten path in Sweden, this itinerary gets you out of the main tourist hubs and highlights the less-touristy side of the country. Here’s my suggested 10-day itinerary:</p>\n<p>Table of Contents</p>\n<h3>Day 1 &amp; 2: Luleå</h3>\n<p>Luleå is home to just 50,000 people and is the last “big” city in the north before you get into Lapland (the northernmost region of the country and home to the indigenous Sami). The city doesn’t take long to see but the surrounding area is what most visitors come for. It’s known for the Gammelstad Church Town as well as its diverse and expansive landscape, ranging from dense forests and tranquil lakes to an archipelago that has over 1,300 islands!</p>\n<p>Here are my suggested things to see and do in Luleå:</p>\n<p><strong>The Archipelago</strong> – Luleå’s archipelago is a hotspot during the summer. Lots of people come from the south to stay here and you can lounge on beaches, go sea kayaking, boating, and hiking and area locals spend many weekends here to take advantage of the nice weather. The most popular islands are Kluntarna, Brändöskär, Junkön, and Småskär.</p>\n<p><strong>Gammelstad Church Town</strong> – Gammelstad Church Town has over 400 red wooden cottages surrounding 15th-century church. It was originally built as overnight lodging for parishioners who traveled long distances and offers a glimpse into Sweden’s rural past. You can wander through narrow lanes with well-preserved cottages, see the medieval stone church, and learn about the traditions of church towns.</p>\n<p><strong>Gammelstadsviken</strong> – Gammelstadsviken is a nature reserve with a large freshwater lake and vast marshlands and one of the best birdwatching spots in Sweden as over 80 different species live here. There’s lots of trails to choose from and it’s not too far from Lulea.</p>\n<p><strong>Norrbotten Museum</strong> – This museum showcases the region’s culture and history. It’s a small, free museum with displays from Sami culture to industrial heritage that gives you a well-rounded picture of northern Sweden.</p>\n<p><strong>Hike</strong> – Summer is the perfect season for hiking in and around Luleå. The area has numerous trails that are ideal for easy-going day hikes, and<a href=\"https://visitlulea.se/\"> Visit Luleå</a> provides an excellent hiking guide to help you choose a route. A few suggested hikes are Hertsöleden (easy, 8km), Fäbodaleden (intermediate, 10km), and Vitån (challenging, 12km).</p>\n<p><strong>The Ice Track</strong> – In winter, a six-kilometer ice track is made around the city center. You can skate or kicksled around it. The track is free to use and is carefully maintained throughout the winter. Kicksleds are free to borrow as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay in Luleå</strong> – <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/clarion-sense.html?aid=1383362&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;group_adults=2\">Clarion Hotel Sense</a> is an affordable hotel right in the center of town. The rooms are comfy, there’s lots of space, and the breakfast buffet has everything you could ever want. There’s even a gym too.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a good place to eat, the harbor has a number of nice restaurants. I particularly enjoyed Bistron.</p>\n<h3>Day 3 &amp; 4: Umeå</h3>\n<p>Head south four hours to Umeå. Founded in 1622 by Swedish King Gustav II Adolf, Umeå is the cultural capital of northern Sweden. It is now a city of 100,000 people known for its huge university (almost a third of the city’s population are students). With so many students here, the city has a young, vibrant feel and there’s lots of affordable restaurants and bars. (And, like everywhere on the coast, there’s easy access to nature.)</p>\n<p>Here are my suggested things to see and do in Umeå:</p>\n<p><strong>Västerbottens Museum</strong> – Here you can explore the cultural and natural history of the Västerbotten region, from local traditions to its maritime heritage. There are documents, textiles, and over 8 million photographs here. The museum also features an open-air section with historic buildings from across the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Guitars the Museum</strong> – Guitars houses one of the world’s largest private collections of guitars and rock memorabilia, with an emphasis on the 1950s and 60s. Even if you don’t know a lot about guitars (I certainly don’t), it’s still a cool place to visit as you’ll learn a ton about the rock and roll scene. Guided tours are available, which I highly recommend as you’ll get much more out of the experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Kulturväven</strong> – Kulturväven is Umeå’s cultural hub, hosting everything from concerts and performances to art exhibitions and community events. Inside, you’ll find a library, cinema, and event spaces. Check the website to see what’s on during your visit as there is always tons happening.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/sweden-coast-itinerary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We spend a day with leading Los Angeles-based environmentalist Leah Thomas to find out.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>What does crafting and climate advocacy have in common? We spend a day with leading Los Angeles-based environmentalist Leah Thomas to find out.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It’s a beautiful afternoon in July, and Leah Thomas and I are in the section of Los Angeles known as Frogtown, walking along the Los Angeles River. Thomas, who is 30 years old, looks Hollywood-chic in a pair of black sunglasses, black sleeveless T-shirt, and leather riding boots . Freckles dot her cheeks and her shoulder-length brown hair swings freely as we meander down the path. A family of ducks swims along in the river, past grassy bogs and reeds, and Thomas decides we should walk down the steep concrete embankment to get a better look.</p>\n<p>“This is where they filmed the car race from Grease,” says Thomas as we climb through the metal guard rails and down to the flowing water. “I’ve kayaked down this river. It’s a protected waterway because it’s navigable—and it got protection because a bunch of environmental hippies got in boats and paddled down it to show that it is navigable, which guarantees protection.” That was in 2008, and, under the Clean Water Act, it meant the river would be guarded from degradation, and that the water in it must meet a certain level of cleanliness.</p>\n<p>Thomas speaks with a soft, lilting voice. Her tone and gentle demeanor belie the fact that she’s leading a powerful environmental movement.</p>\n<p>In 2020, she founded Intersectional Environmentalism, a framework that demonstrates how environmentalism cannot exist in a vacuum—it must account for social justice, racial equity, and economic inequality. Thomas explains that climate change and pollution disproportionately affect marginalized communities, and that advocacy for the planet is inseparable from advocacy for people. “We can’t save the planet without uplifting the voices of its people, especially those most often unheard,” she says. “We should care about the protection of people as much as we care about the protection of our planet.”</p>\n<p>She followed that up the same year with Intersectional Environmentalist (IE), an “eco-media company inspiring climate action through the power of art, education, and storytelling.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“I’ve always loved the earth—animals, being outside, digging in the backyard. But I didn’t see myself as an environmentalist.”</p>\n      <p>- Leah Thomas, founder Intersectional Environmentalism</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Her movement has caused a major paradigm shift in the way activists, nonprofits, and corporations approach environmentalism. Nike, Walmart, Starbucks, and the Sierra Club have asked her to help refocus their sustainability messaging, and Patagonia has cited her work in shaping its campaigns around social and environmental justice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, a new wave of startups and nonprofits now integrate equity and climate into their missions from the outset. Thomas has managed to make inclusion a core principle of sustainability, turning what was once a niche conversation into a touchstone for the wider environmental movement.</p>\n<p>In 2022, Thomas published <i>The Intersectional Environmentalist</i>, a book that dives deeper into her movement. She’s now busy penning a new book, which focuses on <a href=\"https://adventure.com/colorado-river-tanya-houghton-photography\">ecofeminism</a>. But the fight for environmental equality—and, frankly, the fight for a protected environment in general—has taken its toll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Trump administration’s attack on public lands, thirst for dirty fuel sources, and undermining of climate change science, has left Thomas weary. An hour before meeting with Thomas, the administration announced that it was shutting down the Environmental Protection Agency’s scientific research arm. When I told Thomas that, she rolled her eyes and sighed.  </p>\n<p>In 2023, she stepped away as co-director at IE (she still serves on the board of directors). “A lot of people are burnt out,” she says. “That’s why I started crafting.”</p>\n<p>In 2024, Thomas founded Green Girl Productions, producing cultural and community events across the country. Part of that is Green Girl Crafts, which focuses on crafting skills—everything from pottery to kombucha making. In about an hour, I’ll be joining her at one right here in Frogtown. <br/>\n</p>\n<p>“I realized how much we needed mental health and well-being,” she says. “I started ceramics about a year ago and just learned how healing it was for me, so I wanted to offer that to other people. I think we need a reset, especially because I feel like the left is really fractured right now and confused.”</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that Thomas has lost hope or stopped fighting. In addition to crafting, she’s leading “active-ism” trips for Intrepid Travel, which will guide people through America’s national parks and educate them on the work that goes into protecting them. <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us/active-ism-leah-thomas-yellowstone\">In June of next year, she’ll lead a 6-day trip through Yellowstone and Grand Teton.</a> </p>\n<p>“People aren’t just signing up to visit a national park—they’re showing up to protect them,” she says. “It feels symbolic that they also want to learn from someone with an activist background who uses their platform for that purpose.”</p>\n<p>She also says that her crafting events may be the best place to bring together like-minded people from different backgrounds. “Crafting is activism-adjacent,” she says. “I want to show that you can be into sustainability or activism and still connect over things that actually help the community.

Palm-fringed bays are plentiful though there are less genuinely calm swimming beaches on the south and west coasts (and even less standout hotels and resorts located alongside them) as these regions are better known for high quality surfing and body boarding. Sri Lanka’s two opposing monsoons play a role in shaping beaches across the island as offshore currents calm the ocean on the east coast during the summer months, and on the south and west coasts between November and April.</p>\n    <p>Our pick of Sri Lanka’s best beach hotels – which range from a charming five-bedroom bolthole on a swimmable beach to an upscale 150-room resort – all have fine Indian Ocean views and are footsteps away from powdery pale-sand beaches where there’s always a chance of seeing wild marine turtles nesting (or hatching) after dark.</p>\n    <h2>How we review</h2>\n    <p><br/>&#13;\nEvery hotel in this curated list has been visited by one of our expert reviewers, who are usually hosted on a complimentary basis.

    "body": "<p><strong>Morocco’s coolest surf town is no longer a secret – but as its popularity booms, the local community is rolling with the tides. </strong> </p>\n<p>For a second, it feels like I’m losing my balance. But my body reacts before I can think, and my feet readjust, sharpening my stance. I squat lower and my arms steady out – to my surprise, I’m actually gliding along the wave as the whitewash roars behind me. This must be that surfer’s high everyone talks about, I think to myself, beaming. When a local surfer stretches out his arm for a high five, I miss, crashing back into the sea with a laugh that bubbles up from nowhere.</p>\n<p>I’m halfway through a lesson with Dar Surf, a surf camp based in Taghazout, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/morocco\">Morocco</a>. Of course, the waves decide the spot – and it’s rarely on your hostel doorstep. So today we’re a short drive south at Anza Beach, one of countless surf-friendly beaches along Morocco’s Atlantic Coast.  </p>\n<p>Bobbing back to the surface, I catch a glimpse of my instructor, Mohammed Akhermaz – AKA Momo. He throws me a thumbs-up from the lineup, the spot where surfers wait for the next oncoming wave. Like many travellers these days, I had come to Taghazout for the waves and low-key hangouts. But I hadn’t expected to find such a deep sense of community and belonging.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>An Intrepid trip inspired me to uproot my life and move to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>The rise of Taghazout</strong>  </h2>\n<p>Momo grew up in Rabat, Morocco’s capital city about six hours up the coast, and picked up his first surfboard when he was 17 years old. It was a relatively late start in the world of surfing, but one of his best decisions nonetheless. His passion for catching waves led him to become an instructor and he made the move south to Tamraght – Taghazout’s up-and-coming neighbour – five years ago.</p>\n<p>‘Surfing isn’t just a sport,’ he says. ‘It’s a connection between you and the ocean.’</p>\n<p>It’s this feeling of connection that first drew international surfers to Morocco in the early ’60s and ’70s. Once they’d experienced the country’s underrated waves, word soon spread – and it wasn’t long before foreigners were favouring the consistent surf and jaw-dropping scenery in and around Taghazout.</p>\n<p>Surfers from Europe and the United States would stay for months at a time, camping out on the beaches in vans and tents. Slowly, they introduced the sport to the local community. When it was time to move on, they would often leave behind their boards and wetsuits, giving more locals the chance to fall in love with catching waves.</p>\n<p>Once a tiny fishing village, Taghazout became the epicentre of Moroccan surf culture in just a couple of decades. And the rise of homegrown talent like Olympian Ramzi Boukhiam and big-wave surfer Othmane Choufani has further embedded surfing into the region’s identity.</p>\n<p>Today, business is booming; Taghazout’s visitor numbers have jumped 25 per cent in three years and with a multimillion-dollar resort development project well underway, the region is expected to see those numbers continue to grow. While some locals have valid worries about gentrification and rapid change, many see this growth as a positive step.</p>\n<p>‘I don’t remember a time without tourists,’ Momo says. ‘But [the area] has gotten more famous over the last five years. And that’s good for the locals. It gives us a better life.’</p>\n<p>If there’s one way travellers can support Taghazout as it adapts, he adds, it’s to ‘learn about Morocco before you come,’ he says. ‘The number one rule is to respect the culture and the country first.’</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>How I found healing on a group trip to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Waves and warm welcomes</strong>  </h2>\n<p>Despite this quick growth, community bonds still run deep in Taghazout. Perhaps that’s because surf culture and Amazigh hospitality echo the same values of generosity, connection and mutual respect. It’s that kind of welcome that keeps people wanting to come back – although I’ve met a few who have simply never left.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get hooked on that energy. As an introvert, I still found myself drawn into the charismatic nature of the surf herd, cheering when people caught waves and sharing banter with others while I caught my breath at the lineup. Even though I was having a one-on-one lesson with Momo, I was struck by the camaraderie in the water as he gave a few words of encouragement to a lone surfer paddling by. ‘That’s what we do. We share,’ he says, scanning the ocean for the next wave for me to catch. ‘That’s my favourite part. I like to make people happy. Like with you just now, I could see your smile from really far away.’</p>\n<p>Peak surf season is between November and March, but even in July, as I wrestled out of my wetsuit after the session, the lineup remained packed with surfers. Salty and sandy, Momo and I made our way to one of the barefoot beach cafes and plopped down on colourfully-patterned poufs facing the sea. ‘There are always waves,’ Momo says, pointing towards a clean set as we sip our <i>ness ness </i>– Morocco’s signature blend of coffee and milk. ‘A pro would want to surf that.’   </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The best meal I had on my trip to Morocco had little to do with the food</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Riding the wave</strong>  </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/surfing-in-taghazout-morocco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>Set-jetting isn’t just a clever play on words. It’s a very real phenomenon.</strong> </p>\n<p>And while travelling through Thailand earlier this year, I saw it in action. Season three of <i>The White Lotus</i>, set in Ko Samui, was airing at the time, so it naturally came up during a pub crawl conversation. ‘I booked this trip as soon as I saw the trailer,’ a new friend shared. ‘I just knew if I were watching it at home, I’d want to be there.’  </p>\n<p>That’s set-jetting in a nutshell: seeing a beautiful location on screen and wanting to experience it in real life. If you’re ready to step into real-life sets, here are some top set-jetting spots (movie metaphors and the occasional bad pun included) and some very Intrepid ways to get there.</p>\n<h2><strong>Move through Matera with more grace than Bond</strong> </h2>\n<p>It’s not often a high-stakes car chase inspires envy, but that’s what a James Bond movie can do. Between the stunts and the suits, <i>No Time To Die </i>spotlights Matera, a UNESCO-listed city in southern <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/italy\">Italy</a>, as a must-visit destination. </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/italy/premium-puglia-160144\">Premium Puglia</a>, things move at a slower pace. Sip wine, stroll through the famous Sassi cave dwellings with a local guide and learn how this ancient city (dating back to the Palaeolithic period – long before Bond) became so iconic. </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>Northern vs southern Italy</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>(Sand)walk in Timothee Chalamet’s footsteps in Jordan  </strong> </h2>\n<p>Shot for IMAX, <i>Dune: Part One </i>and<i> Dune: Part Two </i>make the most of their epic landscapes – and much of what fans see as Arrakis was filmed in Wadi Rum, a protected desert wilderness in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/jordan\">Jordan</a>. </p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/jordan/explore-jordan-159940\">Explore Jordan</a>, you’ll meet the sheikh of a local Bedouin tribe and learn what life is really like in the desert. Dine on traditional zarb, sleep in a simple Bedouin camp and head out on a half-day jeep safari the next morning. The terrain’s vast, the views are unreal and, thankfully, there are no giant sandworms. </p>\n<h2><strong>Cross Canada like Joel and Ellie</strong> </h2>\n<p>Though set in the United States, much of <i>The Last of Us</i> was filmed in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/canada\">Canada</a>. The post-apocalyptic backdrop of deserted cities and open roads? That’s Alberta. </p>\n<p>On screen, Joel and Ellie trek across America – from Boston to Wyoming – dodging infected humans and wrestling with moral dilemmas. You don’t need to follow in their literal footsteps, but if a cross-country journey’s on your list, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/canada/canadian-rockies-northern-lights-144879\">Canadian Rockies &amp; Northern Lights</a> gives you the drama (minus the zombies) – all with the safety of a small group and an experienced leader. </p>\n<h2><strong>Transform into someone new in Peru </strong> </h2>\n<p>When a franchise hits its seventh film, it needs to step things up to keep momentum. And <i>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts </i>did precisely that by choosing <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/peru\">Peru</a> as the next place for the Autobots to roam. While the movie received mixed reviews, there’s no denying that Machu Picchu makes the most captivating backdrop.  </p>\n<p>The film shows off Peru’s ancient landscapes, but there’s plenty it doesn’t capture too. On <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/peru/classic-peru-160084\">Classic Peru</a>, go beyond the screen with an experience you won’t find in any franchise. Stop for lunch with the Huilloc community in the Sacred Valley and join in a welcome dance.  </p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The joy of seeing Machu Picchu with the descendants of its builders</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Make Poland not</strong><strong><i> </i></strong><strong>A Real Pain</strong> </h2>\n<p><i/></p>\n<p><i>A Real Pain</i>, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin, depicts everything a group tour <i>shouldn’t</i> be. Set on a heritage trip to <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/poland\">Poland</a>, the cousins argue in front of strangers, miss train stops and make things awkward for everyone.  </p>\n<p>For a smoother ride, try <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/czech-republic/best-central-europe-159984\">Best of Central Europe</a>. Like the cousins, you’ll visit a former concentration camp on a guided tour led by a local expert – a sobering and important part of the trip. But after that, things lighten up. You’ll continue through the Tatra Mountains and Budapest, with plenty of train connections caught and no dinners ruined by passive-aggressive bickering or gross burps (fingers crossed). </p>\n<h2><strong>Snack like Carmy in Chicago</strong> </h2>\n<p>Forget Smell-O-Vision (it’s a thing, look it up) – watching <i>The Bear </i>makes you wish someone had invented a way to reach into a TV screen and grab the food. While Carmy’s restaurant is fictional, it was inspired by spots that do exist around Chicago.  </p>\n<p>Join a <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/chicago/chicago-food-experience-tour\">Chicago Food Experience Urban Adventure</a> to get your hands on the best Italian beef sandwich, as well as a deep-dish pizza. There’ll be no shouting or stress, just really, <i>really </i>good food, cousin. </p>\n<h2><strong>Step into a K-cinema set in Seoul</strong> </h2>\n<p>Parasite isn’t your typical set-jetting film. Bong Joon-ho’s thriller is all about class division and capitalism; and it’s largely shot inside, showing the disparity between the Park family’s home and that of the Kim family. And yet, it put <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/south-korea\">South Korea</a> on the big screen, becoming the first South Korean movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars. </p>\n<p>Go to Seoul on <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/south-korea/south-korea-highlights-160776\">South Korea Highlights</a>, where Parasite is set, and see the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) – the most famous Korean divide of them all – with your local leader. And if that noodle dish from the movie’s climax makes you salivate, you’ll love the street food tour of the Gwangjang markets.  </p>\n<h2><strong>Channel your inner Luke Skywalker in Tunisia </strong> </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/set-jetting-film-and-tv-travel-locations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But after years of dealing with the fatigue and weakness that comes with long Covid, she didn’t need another achievement ticked off the list. She just wanted to feel like herself again.</strong> </p>\n<p>It was such a small thing.</p>\n<p>I was sitting on the Old City wall in Khiva, <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uzbekistan\">Uzbekistan</a>, watching the sunset. The heat of the day was dissipating, and I was watching some of the local kids aim a soccer ball at an imaginary goal post. I was a few days into Intrepid’s <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uzbekistan/central-asia-five-stans-express-160772\">Central Asia: Five Stans Express</a> trip, taking a quiet moment to myself to stop, breathe and drink up my surroundings. </p>\n<p>I scanned the horizon from my perch, having just climbed a short but steep set of stairs up onto the wall. For the average person, it was a feat of ‘nothingness’. But for me, it was a small triumph, a quiet win and a relief. ‘Look at you, legs… look what you just did.’</p>\n<h2><strong>The long road back from long Covid</strong></h2>\n<p>People aren’t worrying about Covid-19 too much these days, but for some of us, it’s ever-present. I developed long Covid in 2022, after contracting the virus for the second time. Besides the foggy memory and myriad other annoyances, I lost complete feeling in my toes and developed a debilitating weakness in my legs. These symptoms started about three weeks after I had recovered from the acute infection. At first, I thought I just needed more rest, or to eat better, but nothing helped in the slightest. I simply grew weaker and weaker and weaker.</p>\n<p>My legs had always been the strongest part of me. They hiked me over mountains in Romania, up to the monastery in Petra and over Dead Woman’s Pass on the Inca Trail. But, for a year and a half, those same legs couldn’t get me around a supermarket. Sometimes I was unable to stand up from a chair, other times they collapsed without warning and I would fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>The journey through long Covid isn’t for the faint of heart. Healing isn’t linear. ‘Crashes’ (the sudden and severe drop in physical or mental energy experienced by many sufferers) can happen at the most inopportune times and would leave me bedridden. I quietly wallowed in despair; there’s an abject loneliness that comes from being unable to participate in community. Before long Covid, I went for daily walks on the beach or through my local park, volunteered on multiple boards and attended concerts and festivals. But all of this had slipped away.</p>\n<p>One of my biggest fears was that I would never travel again. If I couldn’t get up the stairs in my own house, how was I going to be able to get around an airport, let alone a foreign country?</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>The road to Machu Picchu starts at 385 lbs</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>A turning point</strong> </h2>\n<p>In 2024, things finally started to improve. I could take small walks. By small, I mean from the parking lot to the beach and back. And then to the water’s edge and back. Maybe 100 paces. It wasn’t hiking in the Andes, but it was something.</p>\n<p>Then, one day, I was scrolling on Facebook when the Five Stans trip popped up in my feed. I scrolled past it initially, then backed up. You know, I didn’t even want to click on it. I didn’t want to get my hopes up and dream of travel, just to deny myself the privilege. But I clicked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkmenistan\">Turkmenistan</a>! Are you kidding me? SOLD!  </p>\n<p>For decades before the word Covid even existed, the Stans had been a bucket list trip for me. I’d been poring over books about the Silk Road for years, reading about this ancient trade route that was steeped in human history. My soul had been harassing me to go to Central Asia. To be there, walking in the footsteps of Genghis Khan, imagining the 1000-camel caravans pulling into Samarkand, would be a true Carla-esque adventure.</p>\n<p>So, did I have the legs to do it? Honestly, in many ways, it was a huge gamble.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><strong>78 reasons to book the damn trip</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>From fear to freedom</strong> </h2>\n<p>On my first night in Turkmenistan, I remember lying in bed and thinking, ‘just 25 more sleeps until I can go home.’</p>\n<p>The thought came from a place of fear and uncertainty. The 44-hour journey from my hometown in Nova Scotia to Ashgabat had knocked the stuffing out of me. I felt exhausted and worried – not just about my own ability to complete the trip, but about dragging the group down with me.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/travel-after-long-covid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Again. We couldn’t help it.</p>\n<p>‘Oh, no,’ he laughed as soon as the tears started to pool, and I laughed as all of us started tearing up with him.</p>\n<p>It had become a thing on this trip – these unexpected moments of emotion bubbling up out of nowhere. But they weren’t really out of nowhere. JD’s tears came when something real truly hit – a story shared, a connection made.</p>\n<p>Like the day before when we visited a family-run pottery shop and learned about the 4000-year-old craft. Overwhelmed by the tradition having survived for generations, he connected with the craftsmen through his emotions. But in this moment it wasn’t just him. Rhem’s eyes glassed over, mine stung and our leader, Elif, wiped her cheek.</p>\n<p>Nuray, our host, smiled as we reached for our napkins. ‘It’s the onions,’ she teased, motioning to her kitchen.</p>\n<p>JD, Rhem, Elif and I were five days into our <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkey\">small group trip in Turkey</a>, which included a visit to Nuray’s home for a home-cooked meal. I spent the last eight years dreaming of one day staying in a cave hotel in <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/turkey/cappadocia\">Cappadocia</a>, and here I was sitting in someone’s cave home? Of course I was feeling emotional. </p>\n<h2>Turkey trips that might move you to tears</h2>\n<p>Sitting on Nuray’s worn sofa, my toes curling on a well-trodden carpet, I took a deep breath. Family photos lined the wall and the smell of slow-simmered tomato and garlic still lingered in the air. Rhem’s shoulders slowly lowered from her ears. It felt like our trip had been moving at full speed, but in this moment, time seemed to slow down.</p>\n<p>Feeling comfortable can make you feel vulnerable. There’s something special about being comfortable enough to allow your walls to fall and your emotions to show. And now here we were, five people who had been strangers just moments before, crying over baklava.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:  Travelling through grief: How I found healing on a group trip to Morocco</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Before the baklava </strong></h2>\n<p>An hour earlier, our van weaved through Cappadocia’s honeycombed rock formations and tourist-packed streets full of souvenir shops before making a sharp turn up a quiet street. We hopped out at the bottom of the hill and started our ascent as cicadas buzzed, dust collected on our sandals, sweat pooled down my back and I regretted wearing a light-coloured shirt.</p>\n<p>Elif pushed open the creaking gate that brought us to our host’s home where we would be sharing lunch together. We walked through the stone courtyard to a home made out of volcanic tuff – a light rock built into the landscape. Surrounded by plants and standing in front of the doorway covered by a white curtain blowing in the wind, Nuray stood on the threshold. Her smile was already reaching her eyes before a word was spoken, and we all found ourselves instantly smiling, too.</p>\n<p>She greeted us like we were longtime friends coming over for lunch with a warm, soft hug that reminded me of my mom as her hand rubbed my back in greeting. Having spent the last three weeks away from home, I leaned into that feeling .</p>\n<p>We weren’t the first guests she’s welcomed into her home, but she made us feel like we were. Her excitement was palpable and made us feel special as she ushered us inside, her smile never fading.</p>\n<p>‘Intrepid comes into my home and I am very, very happy,’ she beamed. Nuray credits her beautifully spoken English to having welcomed Intrepid travellers into her home for the last 12 years. In an effort to tackle gender disparity in Turkey, Intrepid engages local, self-employed women to host activities, and now Nuray gets to share a piece of her home, her family and her culture with people from around the world.</p>\n<h2><strong>A mother on the road </strong></h2>\n<p>Elif had had an extra pep in her step that morning, energised for us to finally meet Nuray after having told us so much about her.</p>\n<p>‘It’s very special, this visit,’ she kept sharing.</p>\n<p>It was Eid al-Ahda, a holiday typically spent with family and loved ones sharing grape leaves and baklava, but Elif was spending her holiday with us. Elif and Nuray hugged for a long time and Elif’s eyes watered a bit – I realised this was her family on the road.</p>\n<p>And for JD, it felt the same.</p>\n<p>It’s been years since JD lived in his home country of New Zealand with his family, and he had been struggling with that distance leading up to this trip. Stepping into Nuray’s gave him the sense of home and familiarity he’s been craving.</p>\n<p>‘I almost felt like her kids were bringing friends over to stay the night, or that we were part of the family and had been there before,’ he tells me later when we reflect on the day. ‘It just felt comfortable, easy and safe. I needed that.’</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:  A first-timer’s guide to Turkish hamams</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Food is how love travels through time</strong></h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/baklava-cave-home-turkey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Try out our picks and feel like you're on vacation every day.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://bluemefragrance.com/products/happiness-ceramic-refillable-diffuser-yuzu-ginger\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/2024-12/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Home%20Smell%20Like%20a%20Hotel/small_Blume_e07d881e04.webp\" alt=\"Image\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Pretend you're staying at a luxury eco-spa with <a href=\"https://bluemefragrance.com/collections/diffusers\">Blueme's Happiness Diffuser</a>. Crafted with clean, phthalate- and paraben-free formulas, these oils are housed in elegant ceramic bottles and diffused through naturally grown rattan reeds. Each reed contains 20 or more porous channels, allowing the fragrance to gently release into your space for up to three months.</p>\n<p>Bring the smell of a five-star hotel to your home with <a href=\"https://www.hotelcollection.com/products/studio-pro-scent-diffuser\">Hotel Collection's Studio Pro Scent Diffuser</a>. This compact diffuser uses a cold-air technology that converts fragrance oil into a dry nano-mist that makes the scent consistent and long-lasting. It's also much safer than a candle since there's no flame or smoke to deal with (just a beautiful fragrance). Despite the diffuser's small size, it can easily scent your entire apartment or house.</p>\n<p>Pair the diffuser with the brand's wide range of scents that are inspired by hotels across the globe, from The Edition Hotel New York to the 1 Hotel Miami Beach.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.jupitersmellsrich.com/products/mykonos-candle?variant=44421831885076\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Untitled_design_bc59c46bbb.webp\" alt=\"Jupiter Smells Rich Candle\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Your house may be hundreds of miles from the beach, but it can smell like you're on an exotic vacation in Mykonos with <a href=\"https://www.jupitersmellsrich.com/products/mykonos-candle?variant=44421831885076\">Jupiter Smells Rich's candle</a>. Notes of wild orchid, jasmine, lemon blossom, vanilla, and sandalwood conjure up an island getaway.</p>\n<p>This luxury candle is made from 100 percent soy wax and has an all-natural beeswax-coated wick to ensure a clean burn. The scent will linger throughout your house long after you've blown out the flame.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://nohohomehawaii.com/collections/reed-diffusers\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Untitled_design_22_1024x256_574bd43104.webp\" alt=\"Noho Home Reed Diffusers\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"125\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>A diffuser is one of the easiest and safest ways to make your home smell like a hotel. A diffuser is a small vial of scented liquid that disperses the fragrance through wooden reeds. Unlike a candle or plug-in, you can just open up a diffuser and forget about it.</p>\n<p>Our favorite diffuser is <a href=\"https://nohohomehawaii.com/collections/reed-diffusers\">Noho Home's Puakenikeni Reed Diffuser</a>. Perfumed oil is housed in a beautiful vessel that efficiently distributes fragerance via reeds. When the scent starts to fade, simply flip the reeds to refresh the smell. We love the Puakenikeni scent, which is designed in Hawaii and inspired by the puakenikeni flower.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/stix-stand-starter-kit\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_enviroscent_difusser_spray_54fbf6bd8e.webp\" alt=\"enviroscent diffuser and spray product stills\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Worried about what you’re breathing in with all of the artificial air fresheners on the market? Enviroscent does things differently, with a focus on making its scents cleaner, healthier, and safer. All of its products use pure fragrance oils in concentrated form (with no additives) and are packaged using renewable and recyclable minimal-waste materials. Scent your space via the <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/stix-stand-starter-kit\">stix + stand diffuser</a>, a <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/car-vent-clip-starter-kit\">car vent clip</a>, or a <a href=\"https://enviroscent.com/products/scent-spritz-starter-kit\">spray</a>.</p>\n<p>No matter which method you choose, it’s all flameless and liquidless to eliminate danger and mess. There are many delectable scents to choose from, including a blend of lavender tea and honey, which smells incredibly relaxing and delicious.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/home-fragrance-diffuser-s/194.htm\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Hillhouse_Naturals_Candle_and_Diffuser_23b376e8ba.webp\" alt=\"Hillhouse Naturals Candle and Diffuser\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p>For a fragrance that will fill your house and last a long time, look to Hillhouse Naturals. This company was founded by a mother/daughter duo who make the products (with the help of a team of women) on their family farm. They use local ingredients, most of which come straight from the farm. Hillhouse Naturals’ <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/home-fragrance-diffuser-s/194.htm\">diffusers</a> last for an average of three to four months, which is significantly longer than most other diffusers on the market. The <a href=\"https://www.hillhousenaturals.com/candles-s/193.htm\">soy candles</a> also burn longer than regular wax candles and don’t have the dangerous chemicals that can be found in mass-market candles.</p>\n<p>You’ll find plenty of unique scents here, including travel-themed varieties like the lakeside diffuser, which smells like \"spectacular sunsets upon fresh cool waters\" and conjures up past waterfront vacations.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://scentfill.com/\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Scentfill_d13a5ed5bd.webp\" alt=\"Scentfill product still\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://scentfill.com/\">Scentfill</a> offers a healthier alternative to traditional plug-ins. The company makes refills that are designed to fit into <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Air-Wick-Scented-Freshener-Warmer/dp/B004IVUX1S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=air+wick+oil+warmer&amp;qid=1578512945&amp;sr=8-9&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=stm07a5-20&amp;linkId=eacccc6703b8fd2e6c36cd5bdb389631&amp;language=en_US\">Air Wick oil warmers</a> but are made with 100 percent plant-based and natural oils rather than chemicals. The fragrances are much more complex and luxurious than what you’d find from a drugstore plug-in—choose the <a href=\"https://scentfill.com/products/relaxing-lemon-lavender-eucalyptus\">Relax Blend</a> with lemon, lavender, and eucalyptus to make your home smell like a high-end hotel.</p>\n<p>Most scents will last between 30 and 60 days if the warmer is set to low, and the refills are reasonably priced at $5.77, making this an affordable option for home fragrances.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgHWWnLLbpQewqhSQgUUR0EAAAFvpObNnAEAAAFKAYQ4zMQ/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MR4Y0CZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?creativeASIN=B01MR4Y0CZ&amp;imprToken=XTVkN36bpA87T.cd9Vzieg&amp;slotNum=1&amp;&amp;ascsub&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;tag=smartrav-20&amp;linkId=4c421413182c0cf63e504c642398a12c&amp;language=en_US\">\n        <graphic loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://img.smartertravel.com/production/Articles/How to Make Your Home Smell Like a Hotel/Content/small_Asakuki_s_5_in_1_Aromatherapy_Device_d4ddf06279.webp\" alt=\"Asakuki’s 5-in-1 Aromatherapy Device\" class=\"list-item-image\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" fetchpriority=\"auto\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smartertravel.com/how-to-make-your-home-smell-like-a-hotel-spa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In his second inaugural address, President Donald Trump wasted no time in setting a bold tone for his next term, unveiling an unexpected pledge to rebrand two iconic natural landmarks.</p>\n    <p>With a flair for shaking up tradition, Trump announced that <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/v/mountain-mount-denali\">Alaska’s Denali, North America’s tallest peak, would once again bear the name Mount McKinley</a>, reversing a decision made in 2015 under the Obama administration. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/v/region-gulf-of-mexico\">the Gulf of Mexico would henceforth be referred to as the “Gulf of America.”</a></p>\n    <h2>Denali National Park</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Frame-1.jpg\" alt=\"denali-national-park\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Frame-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"climbers-mount-denali-alaska\"/>\n    <p>The move sparked a flurry of reactions from geographers, historians, and everyday Americans alike. For some, it was a nostalgic nod to history. After all, <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/v/mountain-mount-denali\">Mount McKinley (click here to see our best McKinley tour packages)</a>, named for the 25th president of the United States, carried that title for over a century before the change to its Indigenous name, Denali – a term meaning “The High One” in the language of the Koyukon Athabaskans. For others, however, the decision seemed like an unnecessary dismissal of Indigenous heritage and the symbolism behind the original name.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Frame-6-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"girl-sitting-on-a-rock-with-usa-flag\"/>\n    <p>During his address, Trump expressed his reasoning with characteristic flair:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>We’re making America great again, one landmark at a time. Mount McKinley is a name that represents history, pride, and tremendous patriotism. And the Gulf of America? It’s about time we called it what it truly is.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The announcement follows a series of actions by the president that many see as attempts to reclaim and reframe national identity. Supporters of the decision have lauded it as a move to strengthen American tradition and unity. Critics, however, have pointed out the potential political and cultural ramifications of renaming sites that hold significant meaning for Indigenous communities and international relations.</p>\n    <h2>Gulf of Mexico</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Frame-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"clearwater-beach\"/>\n    <p>It remains to be seen how quickly maps, atlases, and signage will reflect these changes<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/dena/planyourvisit/fees.htm\"> (the official National Parks Service website still says Denali,</a> with an entry fee of $15 per person or $45 per vehicle, for a seven-day pass). Experts suggest the rebranding could have financial ripple effects, as re-singing, marketing and logistical updates might lead to increased operational costs for the park. This could, in turn, impact tourism pricing, potentially making visits less accessible for some travelers.</p>\n    <p>In the meantime, one thing is certain: Trump’s penchant for branding has extended beyond hotels and golf courses and into the very landscape of the United States.</p>\n    <p>So, what’s next? Renaming the Rockies, perhaps? In Trump’s America, anything is possible.</p>\n    <h2>Rocky Mountains</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CanadaAlaskaOG-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A bright blue lake surrounded by mountains\"/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/patriotic-makeover-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>To go the all-inclusive resort route or not, that is the ultimate vacation question. All-inclusive hotels are known to cut expenses by allowing guests to eat and drink to their heart's content, without worrying about the final bill. However, some travelers argue that unless you're buying multiple rounds of fruity drinks and eating substantial meals at the resort, it's not worth purchasing an all-inclusive package. To find out which camp is right, we're putting two popular luxury hotels in the Cancún area -- one all-inclusive and one not -- head to head for an accurate account on which is truly the best value.</p>\n<p>Item</p>\n<p>Excellence Playa Mujeres (All-Inclusive)</p>\n<p>Westin Lagunamar (Non-All-Inclusive)</p>\n<p>Price Difference</p>\n<p>Base Rate</p>\n<p>$2,692</p>\n<p>$1,107</p>\n<p>$1,585</p>\n<p>Activities</p>\n<p>Included</p>\n<p>$100 (estimated)</p>\n<p>$100</p>\n<p>Food &amp; Drink</p>\n<p>Included</p>\n<p>$382 - $802 (estimated)</p>\n<p>$382 - $802</p>\n<p>Tipping</p>\n<p>$60 (estimated)</p>\n<p>$90 (estimated)</p>\n<p>$30</p>\n<p>Total</p>\n<p>$2,752</p>\n<p>$1,679 - $2,099</p>\n<p>$653 - $1,073</p>\n<p>Here is a more in depth look on the above table, to help you decide if spending the extra money on an all-inclusive resort is worth it.</p>\n<p>First things first, we selected Excellence Playa Mujeres as the all-inclusive resort option, and the Westin Lagunamar Resort Villas &amp; Spa for the non-all-inclusive hotel. These properties are luxury beachfront options, though the former is adults-only while the latter accepts children. Both resorts offer an array of similar features, including several pools, a full-service spa, multiple restaurants and bars, daily activities, nighttime entertainment, and even an on-site mayan ruin.</p>\n<p>Price Comparison All-Inclusive vs. Non All-Inclusive</p>\n<p>Thursday, January 9, 2025, to Sunday, January 12, 2025, for a three-night/four-day stay.</p>\n<p>What’s Included at an All-Inclusive Resort vs. A Regular Hotel</p>\n<p>The Excellence Playa Mujeres’ all-inclusive rate covers 10 buffet and a la carte restaurants, 11 bars serving premium liquor and non-alcoholic beverages, and a beach grill, plus 24-hour room service. Also covered are in-room minibars filled with domestic beer, juices, soft drinks, water, and snacks; in-room premium liquor and wine bottle selection; non-motorized water sports; and exercise classes.</p>\n<p>The Westin Lagunamar rate covers the room, access to facilities (except for the spa), and Wi-Fi. There is no resort fee. Depending on what you plan on doing, you could incur other daily charges. For instance, the Westin Lagunamar has a mini golf course for a small fee, and may charge for other activities. We’ll estimate an extra $100 for on-site activities.</p>\n<p>Visitors at the Westin Lagunamar can choose to dine and drink cheaply or splurge. Though prices vary, beers like Corona are $4 and a margarita costs $8. If each person has three drinks per day, plus bottled water, that will add between roughly $32 to $52 to the grand total.</p>\n<p>Food-wise, if guests choose to eat on-site, they can choose from three restaurants and a swim up bar. Dishes at the restaurants range from approximately $8 to $50 depending on the meal and restaurant choice. Past guests reported spending in the range of $350 to $750 on food for a three-night stay. Which would bring the total to between $1,589 and $2,009, still coming in cheaper than Excellence. That being said, you’re getting a lot more choice at Excellence’s multiple restaurants and bars. It’s hard to put a value on the vacation freedom of having pre-dinner cocktails, an appetizer, entree, wine, dessert, and coffee—without having to crunch the bill numbers. On the other hand, if you’re staying at a non all-inclusive and decide to have a day or night out away from the resort, you won’t feel like you’re wasting money by skipping the all-inclusive buffet.</p>\n<p>Additional Cost at Westin Lagunamara: $382 - $802</p>\n<p>Total: $1,589-$2,009</p>\n<p>Excellence Playa Mujeres: $2,692</p>\n<p>Difference: $683</p>\n<p>Winner (cost): Westin Lagunamara</p>\n<p>Winner (variety): Excellence Mujeres</p>\n<p>Tipping at All-Inclusive Resorts vs. Regular Hotels</p>\n<p>Tipping at all-inclusive resorts is generally expected unless you’re staying at one of the properties that expressly prohibits tips. Couples and Sandals resorts have a strict no-tipping policy, with exceptions for personal butlers and spa services. Although it’s not necessarily expected at some properties, and the Excellence Playa Mujeres states that all taxes and gratuities are included, most past guests report that staff very much appreciates the gesture and often receive extra attention as a result of tipping. Expect to tip between $1 through $10 to bartenders, waiters, room attendants, etc. for a grand tipping total of around $15-20/day. This brings the total for a three-night stay at Excellence to $2,752.</p>\n<p>Tipping at the Westin Lagunamar is more clearly expected, so travelers should be sure to give at least a couple dollars for each drink order, housekeeping visit, and luggage porter service, and more for restaurant meals. The amount guests spend on tips will vary by how much they eat and drink on-site, but budget for around $20-30/day. This brings the new total cost at Westin Lagunamar to between $1,679 and $2,099.</p>\n<p>A huge perk of booking at an all-inclusive resort is that you likely never have to leave the property thanks to all the provided entertainment. That’s certainly true at Excellence Playa Mujeres, where guests can spend their days using free Hobie Cats, paddleboards, kayaks, and snorkel gear. And taking advantage of scheduled activities such as Spanish and cooking lessons, archery and fitness classes, and pool fun such as water polo and aqua aerobics. Entertainment continues into the evening, with performances such as Michael Jackson tributes, magic shows, and stand-up comedy.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/articles/all-inclusive-vs-non-all-inclusive-resort-price-breakdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But then comes the question of where to visit -- each country in the region has its unique atmosphere, and what could be the perfect destination for someone seeking a high-end resort with beachfront views might not work well for budget travelers who wish to immerse themselves in local culture. If you're thinking about heading to the Caribbean but aren't quite sure where to go, here are a few suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Budget Vacations, Adventure</p>\n<p><strong>Superlative:</strong> Cheapest Flights from US</p>\n<p>Occupying the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola (which it shares with Haiti to the west), the <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/dominican-republic/hotels/\">Dominican Republic</a> has long been a traveler favorite. It’s celebrated for its mix of history, culture (merengue and bachata, anyone?), and of course, gorgeous beaches. Even better, the Dominican Republic is both easy to get to and affordable, thanks to a wide range of reasonably priced <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/dominican-republic/hotels/roundups/best-all-inclusive-resorts-in-the-dominican-republic/\">all-inclusive resorts</a> and six international airports around the country, almost all of which have direct daily flights to the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Honeymoons, Couples, Adventure</p>\n<p><strong>Superlative:</strong> Clearest Water, Most Picturesque</p>\n<p>If breathtaking scenery is what you’re after, <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/st-lucia/hotels/\">St. Lucia</a> will not disappoint, thanks to its mystical mountain terrain characterized by sharp mossy peaks jutting up from the Caribbean Sea. While the island nation doesn’t have much of a party or shopping scene, it’s great for both romantic holidays as well as for active vacations. Visitors will appreciate the excellent scuba diving, hiking, and windsurfing opportunities, plus the hot springs and delicious Creole cuisine.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Couples, Adventure</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/jamaica/hotels/\">Jamaica</a> is a great choice if you are interested in both local culture and white-sand beaches. While there are plenty of resorts where you can flop down on powdery sand for the entirety of your trip, the country’s large size, population, and geological diversity means that it’s easy to have a rewarding vacation here without setting foot on a beach. And although Jamaica’s best-known cultural export is its homegrown reggae and dancehall music, the island nation also offers plenty of historic old houses, gorgeous jungle waterfalls, and a wide variety of culinary specialties, from jerk chicken to the national dish of salt fish and ackee (a local fruit that’s cooked to the consistency of eggs).</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> History Buffs, Foodies, Affordability</p>\n<p>Formerly off-limits to Americans, <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/cuba/hotels/\">Cuba</a> is now open to U.S. travelers, though there are still some <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/articles/you-can-still-visit-cuba-despite-trumps-tight-new-travel-restrictions/\">rules to follow</a>. And while things are developing fast, the country is still often likened to a time capsule, with lots of gorgeous old colonial buildings painted in rich pastel hues, vintage cars, and historic forts. There’s also a strong musical tradition here, including a variety of popular styles influenced by African and Latin traditions, plus plenty of great scuba diving and beach resorts for those who like a little R&amp;R with their culture.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Related:</strong>\n      <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/articles/12-things-you-should-know-before-traveling-to-aruba/\">The Ultimate Guide to Aruba</a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Honeymoons, Couples, LGBTQ+</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Superlative: Clearest Water, No Hurricanes</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>One of the more popular year-round Caribbean destinations (it’s located outside the Caribbean hurricane belt, and therefore, has limited rainfall), <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/aruba/hotels/\">Aruba</a> attracts those willing to shell out a pretty penny for high-end shopping, golf at the famous Tierra del Sol course, excellent international cuisine, abundant casinos, and gorgeous stretches of white-sand beach. Although it has more of a tourist vibe than some of the larger island nations (namely, Jamaica, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic), it’s also one of the more welcoming places, thanks to a low crime rate and plenty of family-friendly resorts. Unlike other Caribbean destinations like Jamaica, the country also prides itself on its all-around gay-friendly population.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Non-Passport Carriers, Culture</p>\n<p>If you don’t have an up-to-date passport and want to get a quick fix of Caribbean sunshine, <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/puerto-rico/hotels/\">Puerto Rico</a> might be your best bet. It’s a U.S. territory, so traveling here is like going to another state (you just need your driver’s license or state ID), the currency is the dollar, and your cell phone will work just like it would in the U.S. However, ease of travel isn’t the only reason to visit this culturally rich island. Puerto Rico offers a lot for visitors, including gorgeous beaches, excellent diving, snorkeling, and surfing opportunities, historic forts, great shopping (particularly for arts and handicrafts), wildlife-rich rainforests, and a world-famous bioluminescent bay. And in case you’re wondering, the destination is back in business following <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/articles/why-you-should-visit-puerto-rico-right-now/\">Hurricane Maria</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Adventure, Couples, Luxury</p>\n<p><strong>Superlative:</strong> Underrated</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.oyster.com/articles/where-to-go-in-the-caribbean-a-cheat-sheet-to-the-top-destinations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Are they even for real? Yes! But it takes a bit of luck though. A bit of effort as well. You have to head north, face the cold, be patient and hopefully the magic will unfold!</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>\n        <strong>\n          <strong>No way in Norway</strong>\n        </strong>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Excited by the idea of witnessing Mother Nature’s very own light show, I signed up for a 5-day cruise along the Norwegian coast, not realizing the full extent of expenses I was about to take on. Flights to the northern tip of Norway, a cost-hefty hotel night there and a pretty pricey return flight from Bergen as well. But, I thought, it’s worth it all to experience this natural wonder. Norway… Famously picturesque fjords. Spellbindingly beautiful coastlines. Pure bliss! Little did I know a major storm was to accompany me and my co-traveler from the get-go, almost all the way down to Bergen. Meter-high waves with hours spent in the cabin to avoid nausea—check! Gym weights rolling from one end of the fitness room to the other—check! Admiring the wondrous Northern lights on a night sky sprinkled with stars, and it’s twin reflection on the tranquil Norwegian sea… Not so much.</p>\n<p>Night after night spent waiting for magic to no avail. It felt as if the Norse goddess of the sea, Rán, had decided the time was not right for us to experience the coveted cascade of colors across the night sky. I’ll have to revisit the polar circle and perhaps make some kind of Viking offering rite for good measure… Luckily for you, dear reader, some of my fellow ‘tourradians’ have ventured north and won more favor with the old Norse gods…</p>\n<h2>Iceland, <strong>the Land of Fire and Ice</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Iceland, with its unpredictable weather and vast, untamed landscapes, is a destination that truly benefits from expert guidance.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>While the aurora borealis, as the lights are scientifically called, can sometimes be seen as far south as Stockholm, hitting up Iceland is a safe bet. Why not combine these natural wonders with some Nordic minimalism and dry humor? That’s exactly what Anne, our Digital Marketing Manager did. She opted to go in February when you’re likely to catch the lights, although they can be seen from late September until early April.</p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>“My journey through Iceland lasted seven days, and I must admit that choosing an organized adventure was one of the best decisions I made, despite it not being my usual travel style. Iceland, with its unpredictable weather and vast, untamed landscapes, is a destination that truly benefits from expert guidance.</p>\n<p>Our guide shared his insights to the Northern Lights in Iceland, explaining the science behind this natural phenomenon in an entertaining way, including the role of solar storms and how to interpret the forecasts. His dedication was evident when he woke us in the middle of the night, alerting us to changes in conditions that led to our long-awaited sighting of the auroras. Watching the lights dance across the sky was nothing short of magical!”</p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>“Before this trip, I often wondered about the reality of the Northern Lights—whether they move quickly or slowly, whether they flicker? And if they are truly as vividly colored as they appear in photographs? While it’s true that long exposure photography can enhance their intensity, the actual experience is still profoundly mesmerizing. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting a place where you can witness this natural spectacle.</p>\n<p>That said, even if I hadn’t been lucky enough to see the Northern Lights, my love for Iceland would remain undiminished. The country’s raw, untamed landscapes, combined with its unique cultural heritage, make it a destination unlike any other—a true land of fire and ice.”</p>\n<h2>Northern lights—<strong>Myth vs. Method</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Over three nights, we got to experience the eerie dancing green glow with tails of purple in the dark skies…</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>Many Inuit, Sami and North American Native legends imagined the Northern lights as something ominous. Spirits of the dead making their way across the sky, but the Vikings regarded them as a good omen. To them, the lights were connected with the honorable dead heroes being led to Valhalla by the female Valkyrie warriors. The lights being reflections from the Valkyrie’s shining armors. Today we have more insight on what’s going on and to shed some light on the matter (dad joke—check!), our design lead, Roann, shares his experience.</p>\n<p>“As a big sci-fi fan, seeing the Northern Lights in Iceland felt like something straight out of a movie! When it got dark, our tour guide explained in a detailed presentation how it worked and what the conditions should be for the lights to appear. It was more science, less science fiction. I was in awe.</p>\n<p>Over three nights, we got to experience the eerie dancing green glow with tails of purple in the dark skies. It was very cold, but it was worth sitting outside in the crisp night air, waiting for them to appear!”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>\n        <strong>Managing expectations</strong>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Managing expectations</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>“Seeing the Northern Lights makes you understand how the Vikings and other groups of people in the north could believe there is something mythic about them.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/iceland-and-the-somewhat-elusive-northern-lights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From ancient castles to Tolkienesque landscapes, Scotland and Ireland should be on your list. The weather might be bad, but you’ll have the best time.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Stunning Scotland</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Edinburgh</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>The Scottish capital, Edinburgh, is one of the most incredible cities in the world, famed for majestic buildings like the Edinburgh Castle in the heart of the city. The castle stands at the top of the Royal Mile<strong>, </strong>one of the city’s most iconic streets along with the colorful Victoria Street, located a short walk from the castle. At the bottom of Victoria Street, you’ll find Grassmarket, a bustling square filled with cozy pubs.</p>\n<p>Walking down the Royal Mile and exploring the narrow lanes veining off to each side, it’s easy to imagine why <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/edinburgh\">Edinburgh</a> has been a haven for writers, with the likes of Robert Burns, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and J. K. Rowling. Make sure to stop at the Writers’ Museum in one of the courtyards just off the Royal Mile.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Royal Mile, you’ll find the Holyrood Palace (the King’s official residence in Edinburgh), the modern Scottish Parliament, and Arthur’s Seat, an ancient volcano offering scenic hiking trails and sweeping views of the city.</p>\n<p>Other unmissable sights include the Scottish National Gallery, which not only houses famous paintings like Henry Raeburn’s “The Skating Minister,” but is also free to visit, like most attractions in <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/scotland\">Scotland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/b/great-britain-uk\">the UK</a>. Looking for the perfect postcard picture? Go to Dean Village and Circus Lane, some of the most picturesque spots in the city.</p>\n<h3>Glasgow</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for another culture fix, <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/glasgow\">Glasgow</a>, one of the world’s friendliest cities, is the word. The West End harbors Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, home to everything from dinosaur skeletons to WWII planes to Salvador Dalí’s striking “Christ of St John of the Cross.”</p>\n<p>A short walk north, Glasgow Botanic Gardens, with its magnificent Kibble Palace greenhouse, invites you for a stroll. Both are free to visit. West End is also known for its relaxed vibe. Swing over to the cobbled Ashton Lane, where you’ll find lively bars, restaurants, and thrift stores.</p>\n<p>And if you find yourself on the city’s east side, visit the Glasgow Necropolis, an eerily beautiful Victorian cemetery. Across the street, the medieval Glasgow Cathedral beckons visitors with fine post-war collections of stained glass windows. Both attractions are free to visit.</p>\n<p>As a UNESCO City of Music, Glasgow is also buzzing with places to enjoy live music, from legendary venues like Barrowland Ballroom to cozy pubs, where folk music and dance are not to be missed. Famous artists such as Simple Minds, Belle and Sebastian, and Primal Scream all have their roots in Glasgow.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>The Scottish Highlands</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>We could talk about Edinburgh and Glasgow until the hairy cows come home, but no visit to Scotland is complete without exploring the <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/v/mountain-scottish-highlands\">Scottish Highlands</a>. While you’re driving past lochs (lakes) and through glens (valleys), you’ll learn about the history, stories, myths, and natural wonders of this region.</p>\n<p>Glencoe one of the most famous sights in the Highlands, is a valley formed by glaciers and volcanic eruptions, making it a paradise for hikers, skiers, and water sport enthusiasts. James Bond fans will get their geek on in Glencoe, as it was the filming location for “Skyfall.” Numerous movie classics such as “Trainspotting,” “Braveheart,” and, of course, the Harry Potter saga are set in the Highlands.</p>\n<p>Another top sight is Loch Ness, home of Scotland’s most famous citizen, Nessie. The lake holds more water than all of the lakes in Wales and England. Plus, it’s fantastic for cycling, canoeing, and music nerds. Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page used to own the mysterious Boleskine House near the lake, which occultist Aleister Crowley had previously owned. Remember Ozzy Osbourne’s 80s song “Mr. Crowley?”</p>\n<p>On Scotland’s west coast, the otherworldly <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/v/islands-isle-of-skye\">Isle of Skye</a> awaits. The island is teeming with natural wonders, from the aptly named Fairy Pools to the Kilt Rock waterfalls gushing down cliffs into the sea to the Old Man of Storr rock formation set against wavy hills.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>The weather in Scotland</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>Spring is mild, with occasional rains, offering dazzling displays of blooming trees and lush landscapes. Summer is warm but rarely breaches 68°F (20°C). Rainy mornings often clear up during the day. Fall paints Scotland in fiery colors, a real treat for photographers. The weather is cool, and chances of rain are high. Winter, particularly December, sees the most rain, and cold air will shake you to your bones. The Scottish Highlands get proper snow, ideal for snow sports enthusiasts.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Incredible Ireland</strong>\n    </h2>\n<h3>\n      <strong>Dublin</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p>When visiting <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/ireland\">Ireland</a>, your first stop will undoubtedly be Dublin. Visit the Old Library at Trinity College, one of the world’s most stunning libraries, and admire the Book of Kells, a beautifully ornamented book dating back 1,200 years. If you’re looking for a scenic stroll, Phoenix Park is unmissable. It’s the largest enclosed park of all European capitals. </p>\n<p>Music lovers should check out the Irish Rock’ n’ Roll Museum, which is full of memorabilia from bands like U2 and Thin Lizzy. After a day of exploring, nothing beats having a pint in one of <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/dublin\">Dublin</a>’s many iconic Temple Bar neighborhood pubs.</p>\n<h3>\n      <strong>East Ireland’s ancient sites</strong>\n    </h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/days-to-come/visit-these-gloomy-destinations-for-a-great-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here’s our full advertising policy: <a href=\"https://millionmilesecrets.com/guides/advertising-policy/\">How we make money</a>.</p>\n<p><i>This article was generated with the help of Artificial Intelligence</i>.</p>\n<p>Marriott, a name synonymous with luxury and comfort, offers a unique reward program, Marriott Bonvoy, that provides patrons with the opportunity to earn points for their stays. These points, when accumulated, hold substantial value and can be redeemed for future stays, making every visit to a Marriott hotel more rewarding. The value of Marriott points is estimated to be between 0.7 cents to 0.9 cents each, indicating that they offer below-average value for a hotel reward program. However, their true potential is realized when they are utilized wisely.</p>\n<p>Marriott points, through the Bonvoy program, can be redeemed for free stays at any participating Marriott hotel. To do this, one must log into their Marriott Bonvoy member account and apply their accumulated points during the booking process. This provides a wonderful opportunity to experience luxury stays without any significant expenditure. For every five consecutive nights that you pay for with Marriott Bonvoy points, you receive the lowest point-value night for free, providing added incentive to accumulate and utilize these points.\\n\\nAnother interesting feature of the Marriott Bonvoy program is the ability to use points for instant redemption during your stays for food, beverages, spa experiences, and more. Anything that can be charged to your hotel room can be covered with these points. This means that not only can you pay for your stay using Marriott points, but also enhance your stay with additional amenities and experiences, making it a truly rewarding program.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the value of Marriott points extends beyond mere monetary evaluation. Their true worth is in the experiences they can provide to patrons. By effectively utilizing these points, one can enjoy free stays, added amenities, and a range of benefits that significantly enhance the experience of staying at Marriott. Truly, Marriott points open up a world of possibilities for patrons.</p>\n<h2>Marriott Award Chart<br/></h2>\n<p>Marriott Bonvoy’s award chart is a convenient tool that helps members understand how their accumulated points can be redeemed for free nights. The award chart, while not officially published, plays a crucial role in planning your stays at Marriott properties. It facilitates the evaluation of the usefulness of Marriott’s Free Night Certificates, which commonly range in values like 35K, indicating the number of points required for a free night.</p>\n<p>To use your Loyalty Points for free nights, you simply search for a stay with the preselected ‘Use Points / Awards’ option, select your desired hotel and room type, and review your reservation details. If an award is available for your stay, you can confirm your booking. However, it’s essential to note that Marriott has introduced flexible award pricing starting March 2022, indicating a shift in their pricing strategy for award nights.</p>\n<p>The number of Marriott points needed for a free night varies significantly. Free Night Awards start at just 5,000 points, providing a great advantage for travelers who want to make the most of their rewards. Depending on the property and room type, you may need anywhere between 4,500 to 100,000 Marriott points for a free night, making it extremely flexible and advantageous for all types of travelers.</p>\n<p>The Marriott award chart is an essential tool for Marriott Bonvoy members. While it may not be officially published, it offers invaluable insight into how one can plan their stays and redeem their points effectively. By understanding the points needed for a free night and the new flexible award pricing, members can maximize the benefits derived from their Marriott points.</p>\n<h2>Peak and Off-Peak Pricing<br/></h2>\n<p>Marriott Bonvoy’s pricing strategy for award stays incorporates a dynamic aspect known as peak and off-peak pricing. Understanding this pricing mechanism is crucial for members to plan their stays effectively and make the most of their Marriott points. The previous hotel categories (1-8) and redemption rates, which were classified as off-peak, peak, or standard, have been replaced with Flexible Point Redemption, indicating a shift towards a more adaptable pricing strategy.<br/>A night’s stay at a Marriott property can cost anywhere between 5,000 points (for a category 1 hotel in the low season) and 100,000 points (for a category 8 hotel in the high season). The determination of these seasons is dependent on various factors, primarily demand, ensuring a dynamic pricing model that changes as per fluctuating demand patterns.<br/>While it’s true that average nightly rates may have increased for many properties, it’s still possible to find rooms at their previous off-peak or new lower rates. This means that despite the pricing changes, there are still opportunities for members to find value in their Marriott points and enjoy beneficial redemptions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Marriott’s peak and off-peak pricing model, now replaced by the Flexible Point Redemption, offers a dynamic approach to pricing award stays. This approach, while presenting a learning curve for members, also offers opportunities for value-based redemptions. By understanding this pricing model, Marriott Bonvoy members can strategically plan their stays and maximize the potential of their accumulated points.</p>\n<h2><br/>Marriott Redemption Chart<br/></h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://millionmilesecrets.com/uncategorized/unlocking-the-value-of-marriott-bonvoy-points-a-comprehensive-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Trust us, the Taj Mahal and Santorini aren’t the only golden nuggets out there.</p>\n<p>A challenge of today’s adventurer is to avoid mass-tourism, either by visiting the popular sights when they are less crowded, often referred to as ‘shoulder season’ or, take aim at something a little less known but just as magical. That’s where this read comes into play. Let’s shine a light on some captivating places that you might not have considered just yet, with testimonials from people that have actually been!</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>\n        <strong>Rising star… Albania</strong>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rising star… Albania</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>freepik</p>\n<p>This small and relatively unknown European country packs a punch! Nestled between the mountains of the southern Balkan peninsula and the azure Adriatic coast, it’s fast becoming a favorite Mediterranean destination, offering similar delights to its neighbors Greece, Montenegro and Croatia further north, but at generally lower rates!</p>\n<p>The rugged coast, sprinkled with stunning beaches and mountainous views overlooking them is a major draw with Vlore, Saranda and Ksamil in the south beckoning tourists from near and far but <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/tg/albania\">Albania</a> has much more to offer, from Roman ruins and Ottoman fortifications to absolute premium hiking trails and a unique history and culture for you to explore.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I fell in love with Albania! It is a stunning country; while driving through the mountains there were breathtaking views everywhere.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Quirine, our Customer Support Training and Development Lead, booked an <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/albania\">adventure in Albania</a> and loved it so much she’s thinking of returning for more.</p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>“I fell in love with Albania! It is a stunning country; while driving through the mountains there were breathtaking views everywhere. The capital Tirana is full of good vibes and energy with amazing food and drinks to try out. I had some of the best tomatoes and their coffee is simply awesome. I learned so much traveling around, the heartwarming hospitality made me feel welcome everywhere and really makes me want to go back!”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong><strong>Africa’s Mediterranean gem.</strong>..<strong> Algeria</strong></strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Africa’s Mediterranean gem.</strong>..</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Algeria</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>unsplash</p>\n<p>Often overshadowed by its western neighbor Morocco when it comes to number of visitors, Algeria is not one to sleep on and is vying for your attention! While the tourism industry here is less developed, you can expect equally marvelous architecture, cuisine and truly genuine adventures with fewer tourist traps and without a pushy salesman at every corner.</p>\n<p>The capital Algiers is a bustling metropolis on the Mediterranean coast, boasting several breathtakingly beautiful mosques and a UNESCO World Heritage-listed citadel, or casbah if you will, founded on the ruins of the Roman settlement Icosium from the 10th century onwards. In fact, Algiers is just your starting point and across the country there are adventures of every kind waiting to be experienced, from overnight Bedouin camps to prehistoric cave art!</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>Whether you are a relaxed beach-goer, a passionate foodie, or a bold adventurer, Algeria has whatever you are looking for.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>Jana is our Employee Experience Coordinator at our Vienna office and always seeks out somewhat unexpected destinations. This is what she had to say after her adventure in Algeria last year…</p>\n<p>“Algeria is just magical. Whether you are wandering around Roman ruins, getting lost in the ancient city of <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/algeria#cities=10038\">Constantine</a>, swimming in an oasis under a starry night sky in Taghit, or discovering rock paintings that are thousands of years old in the middle of the Sahara Desert, you constantly feel like you are on another planet…</p>\n<p>With the dreamy blue skies and the Mediterranean coast in the north, and the dunes, lush oases, and vastness of the desert in the south, there is something for everyone. Whether you are a relaxed beach-goer, a passionate foodie, or a bold adventurer, Algeria has whatever you are looking for.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>\n        <strong>Can’t get enough of cool Colombia</strong>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Can’t get enough of cool Colombia</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>©</strong>pexels</p>\n<p>Peru has long been the winning destination in South America when it comes to international visits, and with Machu Picchu being one of the most iconic places in the world we don’t see that changing anytime soon. But, did you know that there’s an older ruined city deep in the jungles of our next country <a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/tg/colombia\">Colombia</a>?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tourradar.com/d/colombia#cities=42796\">Ciudad Perdida</a>, tucked away in the green hills of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, close to the Caribbean Coast, predates Machu Picchu by ca. 650 years and is testament to the long and varied history of pre-columbian civilization in South America. While there isn’t much architecture preserved, as wooden structures were the standard here, there are pathways, stairs and terraces laid out with traces of buildings and gardens from as far back as 800 CE. Rather uniquely, the access today is entirely in the hands of the native Kogi people, descendants of the Tayrona that once lived here, making sure visitors get an authentic and respectful experience while also preserving the lost city and it’s natural surroundings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>I just can’t get enough of Colombia, it is 100% the gift that keeps on giving, especially the countryside. Wherever I go I feel like time stood still and I’m getting a taste of days long past before they’re gone.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p><strong>©</strong>TourRadar</p>\n<p>Colombia has many varying climates and, as it’s close to the equator, welcoming all year ’round.

    "body": "<p>Austin has become one of the most popular places in the US to move to, and also to visit. Droves of people descend on the city in March for the South by Southwest tech, film and music festival and in the fall for the Austin City Limits music festival. And Austin is one of the <a href=\"https://gitnux.org/most-popular-bachelorette-party-destinations/#:~:text=Las%20Vegas%20is%20the%20most,ranks%20fourth%20among%20bachelorette%20destinations.\">top five</a> destinations in the US for bachelorette parties. Don’t let the bachelorettes scare you away, though. Austin is a great place to spend a few days, so long as you do it like a local.</p>\n<p>My family and I moved to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/austin\">Austin</a> 12 years ago, after living in New York for many years. I’ve also lived in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/mar/16/washington-dc-three-day-travel-guide\">Washington DC</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/mar/04/san-francisco-three-day-locals-travel-guide\">San Francisco Bay Area</a> and Philadelphia. Austin has a feel all of its own: it has a world-class music scene, great food that now goes well beyond Tex-Mex and barbecue, Texas history and fun shopping and museums – all with less hassle than bigger cities in the US.</p>\n<p>Here’s my guide to a long weekend there. In addition to picks for adults, I’ve included some recommendations for families that our kids (now teenagers) have loved through the years. And I’m vegetarian, so I’ve chosen some of the city’s best veggie eats options. Don’t worry, my meat-eating wife made sure that I included great barbecue choices, too.</p>\n<h2>Day 1: Pool party &amp; pickles</h2>\n<p>Start your day with a walk or run on the trail at Town Lake (it’s officially labeled on maps as Lady Bird Lake, but locals refer to it as Town Lake). This 10-mile (16km) trail on both sides of a dammed portion of Texas’s Colorado River (a different <a href=\"https://coloradoriver.org/river-facts/\">Colorado River</a> than the bigger and more famous one) is tree-shaded, beautiful and one of Austinites’ favorite places to exercise. If you have time, walk through Zilker Park, which is right next to the trail. If you have kids, go to the new and very fun playground at Butler Park, complete with a splash pad just up the path from the playground.</p>\n<p>Austin was one of the cities that started the food truck scene in the US several decades ago, and now there are more than 2,000 food trucks in the city. Some are located in trailer parks that have multiple truck options and picnic table seating. After your morning at Town Lake and Zilker Park, have lunch at <a href=\"https://www.austintexas.org/listings/the-picnic/7288/\">the Picnic</a> food truck park, or the nearby original location of local favorite <a href=\"https://www.chuys.com/locations/barton-springs\">Chuy’s</a> (the Tex-Mex chain is now expanding throughout the US). Other great lunch options include <a href=\"https://greenmesquite.com/\">Green Mesquite</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bunkhousehotels.com/carpenter-hotel/carpenters-hall\">Carpenters Hall</a>.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, go for a swim at <a href=\"https://www.austintexas.gov/department/barton-springs-pool\">Barton Springs Pool</a>. Open year-round, this massive basin measures three acres and is fed by underground natural springs. It’s open throughout the day, and it’s free before 8am and after 9pm.</p>\n<p>Head back to your hotel or Airbnb for a rest, and then get ready for dinner. Tonight is casual: barbecue at <a href=\"https://terryblacksbbq.com/\">Terry Black’s</a>, or if you’re vegan, the food truck <a href=\"https://rollinsmokeatxbbq.com/\">Rollin Smoke</a> for a fantastic vegan barbecue sandwich made with baby portobello mushrooms, spicy slaw, barbecue sauce and pickles. It’s my favorite vegan barbecue sandwich in Austin (who says you can’t have barbecue if you’re veggie?), and it’s located in a food truck park with beautiful old trees shading the tables. Rollin Smoke has very good meat options, too (I’m told).</p>\n<p>If you have young children, head to <a href=\"https://www.philsicehouse.com/\">Phil’s Icehouse</a>. They have burgers and a full playground where the kids can play before or after dinner. Just don’t put them on the spinning flower after the meal. And be sure to get some ice-cream after dinner at <a href=\"https://amysicecreams.com/\">Amy’s Ice Creams</a>, a longtime favorite of Austinites. Amy’s is located next to Phil’s, and it’s so good we had an Amy’s truck serve dessert at our wedding.</p>\n<p>After dinner, head out to see some music at one of Austin’s many local music venues. One of our favorites is the <a href=\"https://continentalclub.com/\">Continental Club</a>. There’s a main club downstairs and the intimate Continental Gallery upstairs, where you can see local musicians in a cozy space. Other great venues include <a href=\"https://www.cboys.com/\">C-Boy’s</a> and the new <a href=\"https://www.moodyamphitheater.com/\">Moody Amphitheater</a>. For full local music listings on any night, check the <a href=\"https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/music/\">Austin Chronicle</a>. And if it’s summer, look to see if <a href=\"https://www.acl-radio.com/blues-on-the-green/\">Blues on the Green</a> has a free concert that night. If you have kids, take them to the free <a href=\"https://kutx.org/live-events/kutx-events/rock-the-park/\">Rock the Park</a> concert series, produced by local radio station KUTX.</p>\n<h2>Day 2: Breakfast tacos, books &amp; bats</h2>\n<p>Start your day back at the lake with a rowing workout that’s almost, but not quite, on the lake. <a href=\"https://www.rofitness.com/\">Rō Fitness</a> is a local studio that has outdoor rowing classes by the water. It’s way more fun than working out at an indoor studio.</p>\n<p>You’ll need fuel after your workout. Grab a breakfast taco at <a href=\"https://veracruzallnatural.com/\">Veracruz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tacodeli.com/\">Tacodeli</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tamalehouseeast.com/\">Tamale House East</a>. Breakfast tacos are an Austin staple (they are to Austin as bagels are to New York), and all three of these places have delicious options.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/26/austin-texas-three-day-travel-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I still had a great time in New York, and ended up moving here a couple of years later.</p>\n<p>On that first trip I did all the main tourist things which, owing to the miscommunication, I had thought my mother had wanted to do: I went up big buildings, looked at big buildings, drank in bars beneath big buildings.</p>\n<p>It was great and everything, but there’s much, much more to do here – especially if you like eating, riding about by subway and ferry, and bargaining for knockoff luxury goods.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Day 1: Boating and brownstones</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>A lot of people have heard of the <strong> Staten Island ferry</strong>, and for good reason. It’s free to travel on the big orange boats between the southern tip of Manhattan and Staten Island. The route goes right past the Statue of Liberty, and offers amazing views of lower Manhattan.</p>\n<p>As a boat lover, I’d also recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.ferry.nyc/\">NYC </a><strong> ferry</strong>. It has a flat fare of $4 and operates up and down the East River, passing under bridges and allowing riders to snoop at waterside buildings.</p>\n<p>If you’re starting in Manhattan (which you probably are), take the southbound ferry from East 34th Street to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brooklyn\">Brooklyn</a> neighborhood of Dumbo, which stands for “down under the Manhattan Bridge overpass”. It’s here where everyone with an Instagram account gets their shots of both the Manhattan Bridge and the (older, better-known) Brooklyn Bridge. Plenty of people will visit this area then turn their back on Brooklyn, but I’d recommend sticking around New York City’s most populous and, depending whom you speak to, trendiest borough.</p>\n<p>Pop by <strong> Jane’s Carousel</strong>, an exquisitely restored 1922 ride which is plonked between the bridges, and then walk south through Brooklyn Bridge Park. You’ll go past several piers – once working docks now transformed into leafy picnic and sport areas. There are magnificent views across to Manhattan. It’s a nice spot to propose to a partner, as my little brother did last year. If you don’t want to do that, but do like to play soccer or basketball or roller-skate, you’re in luck.</p>\n<p>After you hit Pier 6, where there’s a pleasant, if expensive, rooftop pizza restaurant called <strong> Fornino</strong>, walk up Atlantic Avenue for some shopping and coffee at </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>, an independent clothing store with a hidden bar in the back. The owner, Dave Alperin, a fourth-generation Brooklynite, is very friendly and knowledgable about the area and can give you tips about everything from where to buy the</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>best sandwich (</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>– try the Mamma Roma) to the location of a semi-secret basement speakeasy (</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>) nearby.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>From there I’d take a bus or cab to Fort Greene, a very pretty neighborhood whose townhouses are the sort of Brooklyn thing you see in the movies, and grab dinner at <strong> Olea</strong>. If you make it before 6.30pm, there’s a great happy hour.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Day 2: Rude </strong>\n      <strong>T-shirts and not-quite Rolexes</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Manhattan’s Soho neighborhood has all the posh shops, so if you have money, or like looking through windows at expensive clothes and bags, walk east along Prince Street from West Broadway. There are nice buildings to look at around here too – the newly constructed towers that abound in the city are largely absent in this neighborhood. Stop in at <strong> Fanelli Cafe</strong>, a neighborhood stalwart that has been around since 1847, for a coffee or some food, then head south along Broadway to Chinatown.</p>\n<p>There are lots of great dim sum places, including <strong> Golden Unicorn</strong>, whose large fancy dining hall is located on the second floor of a marble-esque building. From there I’d take a walk along Canal Street, dipping into sidestreets for cheap souvenirs – snow globes, little statues and that sort of thing – and bizarre T-shirts (many of which are very rude).</p>\n<p>Chinatown also does a roaring trade in imitation watches and handbags. So if, like me, you will not and cannot spend $30,000 on a watch but have about $100 to spare, you can get (to my eye) a fairly good imitation. The food markets along Canal Street also sell real nice timepieces – they even work – if you fancy sticking it to big watch. You’ll find plenty of “designer” bags too.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’re hungry again, because <a href=\"https://www.greatnewyorknoodletown.com/\">Great N</a><a href=\"https://www.greatnewyorknoodletown.com/\">Y</a><strong>  Noodletown</strong> is, per its name, great – especially the roast pig on rice.</p>\n<p>From there I’d head farther south and stop in at <strong> Whiskey Tavern</strong>, the friendliest bar I’ve ever been to in my life (and I’ve been to a lot of bars). They print out personalized welcome signs that they will stick to your table or behind the bar, which sounds a bit naff – but isn’t. The real reason to come is to chat to locals and regulars. It’s also one of the closest bars to city hall, which means there’s a regular stream of “Just Married” couples doing shots of whiskey and eating chicken wings.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/mar/22/nyc-three-day-travel-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
