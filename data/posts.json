Paris St-Germain won last season's tournament - the first to be held using a new expanded format with a 36-team league phase</p>\n<p><strong>BBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty:</strong> My pick to win it are <strong>Liverpool,</strong> purely on the basis of the huge strengthening they have carried out this summer. Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are two high-class players who are Champions League-ready.</p>\n<p>The vagaries of the new league system last season saw Liverpool meet eventual winners PSG in the last 16, where they lost on penalties at Anfield.</p>\n<p>If Liverpool reach the knockout phase, which they surely will, then the Anfield factor grows with every game.</p>\n<p>PSG will be the big danger once again, a superb side who deserve the status as the best team in Europe, while Real Madrid come into every Champions League conversation as potential winners.</p>\n<p><strong>BBC's senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel:</strong> I'm going for <strong>Liverpool.</strong> Four wins from four in the Premier League and they haven't even nearly hit top gear yet. Oh, and Isak is waiting in the wings. Arne Slot's side are the team to beat.</p>\n<p><strong>Former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger:</strong> Real are usually the club with the strongest mentality in this competition, but PSG have to be one of the favourites and Liverpool are too, given that they had such a good Premier League season then invested so much in their squad.</p>\n<p>Those two teams come immediately to mind when I think about who will play in the final, and if I have to pick one to win it then I will go with <strong>Liverpool.</strong> Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.</p>\n<p><strong>BBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray:</strong> When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than <strong>Liverpool.</strong></p>\n<p>Last season they lost out only narrowly to the eventual winners in a penalty shootout. It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.</p>\n<p><strong>Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson:</strong> Tipping <strong>Real Madrid</strong> to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. </p>\n<p>His progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.</p>\n<p><strong>The Observer football correspondent Rory Smith:</strong> It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since <strong>Real Madrid</strong> won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Former England captain Steph Houghton:</strong> I am backing <strong>PSG</strong> to win it again. They are a young squad that has experienced winning already, plus they are athletic and forward thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin:</strong> For a change, I went with my head over my heart. I love <strong>PSG</strong> and the way they play, and the way they have changed the way football is being played now with their attacking attitude. I also love that they love their wingers!</p>\n<p><strong>Spanish football expert Guillem Balague:</strong> I feel <strong>PSG</strong> have started a new era of success that has to do with using cleverly the predominant model of our times - positional football - mixed with quality, clear leadership and top players in each position. </p>\n<p>Barcelona will be close, but I'm not sure they will sort out their defensive deficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1kwmjxwpkxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His decision was to ignore Doku and instead defend the wide spaces - stepping up to press O'Reilly when the ball went to him.</p>\n<p>Doku's inside position ensured City had an overload around United's midfield.</p>\n<p>Rodri, Phil Foden (who had dropped deeper), Doku (who had moved inside) and Tijjani Reijnders formed a box around United's midfield duo.</p>\n<p>It was the same tactic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2djywy3754o\">Fulham used against United</a> earlier this season, when Alex Iwobi vacated his left-wing position to create an overload in midfield.</p>\n<p>O'Reilly stands on the touchline, Doku moves into midfield and City have an overload centrally</p>\n<h2>United's disjointed press</h2>\n<p>With Doku infield, it was Leny Yoro - United's right centre-back - who was tasked with pushing up aggressively on him.</p>\n<p>That is a difficult ask for a natural central defender, especially with Doku dropping as deep as his own half, and it was made more difficult as Foden also occupied those areas.</p>\n<p>Yoro's front-footed defending made the midfield battle a four against three - rather than four against two - at times, but he would often retreat when City's players moved deeper as he did not want to end up too far from his backline.</p>\n<p>By not committing entirely to backing up the press in a man-to-man fashion, United's press was disjointed - meaning City had a free man somewhere.</p>\n<p>United captain Bruno Fernandes touched on this after the match, admitting his team needed to be \"more brave with full pressure\" to prevent the opening goal.</p>\n<p>\"City take that risk against us - we need to do the same,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I was trying to press Rodri because the aim of the midfielders was for one to jump on Rodri, with one of the defenders on Foden.</p>\n<p>\"In the first moment, I can cover both but Leny comes up so I go more on Rodri. And Leny was going backwards because of a miscommunication and we end up giving too much space on the pitch.\"</p>\n<p>A team-wide man-to-man press would ensure easy passing options aren't available for the opposition.</p>\n<p>As Fernandes mentions, it was the job of one of the defenders - namely Yoro - to jump on Foden. But the clever positioning of O'Reilly and movement of Doku meant he was left in two minds.</p>\n<p>Foden was able to receive the ball under no pressure and carry it up the pitch - a situation that was replicated later in the game.</p>\n<p>Yoro was tasked with stepping up to press Foden but Doku's movement infield meant he had an extra player to pay attention to</p>\n<h2>City's clever use of pinning</h2>\n<p>City's use of pinning was particularly impressive.</p>\n<p>Pinning is the act of positioning a player in a certain area with the result an opponent also has to stay there.</p>\n<p>If a winger stands on the touchline next to the opposition full-back, for example, the defender is unlikely to leave that area as the attacker would be free. The winger has, therefore, 'pinned' the full-back.</p>\n<p>City used pinning throughout Sunday's game to make United's aggressive defending tactics weaker, and to open up space for their attackers.</p>\n<p>We've already spoken about how O'Reilly pinned Mazraoui to the touchline, leaving Doku free to move inside without being followed.</p>\n<p>On the other flank, we saw clever movement from Reijnders on to Luke Shaw that prevented him from leaving the back five. As a result, Doku's unorthodox positioning - having vacated his flank - allowed him to pick up the ball unopposed.</p>\n<p>Amorim asks his wide centre-backs to step out and apply pressure to the extra opposition player if United are outnumbered in midfield, but with Shaw stuck with Reijnders, City had Doku free.</p>\n<p>Given time, Doku was able to turn and drive with the ball and provided the assist for the first goal.</p>\n<p>With Shaw focused on Reijnders, Doku can receive the ball without pressure.</p>\n<h2>United's midfielders fail to track runners</h2>\n<p>For City's first goal, Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were back in defensive positions, but the hosts were able to pick up the loose ball in the penalty area uncontested.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckge4jpy4l5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The father of a Cardiff man who has spent 20 years in prison after stealing a mobile phone has said his son has served a \"life sentence\" behind bars.</p>\n<p>Leroy Douglas, 44, was handed a minimum term of two-and-a-half years in 2005 for robbery, but remains in custody as he is subject to an indeterminate sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP).</p>\n<p>The controversial measure <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19630617\">was scrapped in 2012</a>, but campaigners are calling for those currently serving an IPP to be resentenced and have filed a case against the UK before the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Justice said it released the highest annual number of IPP prisoners on record last year with additional support given to those in custody.</p>\n<p>IPPs are a type of sentence which means inmates can be detained indefinitely if the parole board <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06086/\">decides it is not safe to release them</a>.</p>\n<p>They were designed to detain offenders who posed a \"significant\" risk of causing serious harm to the public, but faced criticism after being handed out for less serious crimes.</p>\n<p>Defendants must serve a minimum term before being considered for release by the parole board but this is not automatic. They are also subject to licence conditions which they must follow or risk being recalled to prison once they are released.</p>\n<p>Anthony Douglas, 63, said his son was a \"normal kid\" growing up who was \"easily led\" to make bad decisions.</p>\n<p>He said Leroy Douglas, who is now in<strong> </strong>HMP Stocken in Stretton, Rutland started to get into trouble along with friends and received convictions for crimes including for shoplifting as a teenager and young man.</p>\n<p>However, he said it \"all escalated\" when the dad-of-two was sentenced for stealing a mobile phone belonging to his cousin's boyfriend in 2005.</p>\n<p>Instead of a fixed term two and a half year custody sentence, he was handed an IPP, which his family said was a \"shock to everyone\".</p>\n<p>\"He got two-and-a-half years and the next thing I know is that he's still in there all these years later,\" Mr Douglas said.</p>\n<p>\"I expected him to do half of the two-and-a-half years and start fresh again.\"</p>\n<p>Mr Douglas has not been able to make the journey to visit his son in person since he was sentenced, but speaks to him regularly on the phone.</p>\n<p>While in custody, Leroy Douglas had to be told of his daughter's death after she suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage aged 20, as well as losing his grandparents and other family members, something which his dad said had affected his mental health.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Douglas he has been moved to different facilities a number of times, which has resulted in him having to repeat training and courses needed for him to be considered for release.</p>\n<p>\"We are not the only ones suffering, the whole family is with him being in prison,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Mr Douglas admitted his son had struggled with poor behaviour while in custody, but said being in a prison environment from a young age had created the \"product that he is today\".</p>\n<p>\"His family is outside, so inside the only role models he's got are those who are already in prison,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"He started to act out because he doesn't think it's fair that he's been kept in there that long, so that's had an impact on his behaviour.\"</p>\n<p>While Leroy Douglas has suffered with addiction in the past, his dad said he had tested negative for drugs while in prison.</p>\n<p>Andrew Taylor, criminal barrister at Apex Chambers, has represented about 10 clients who were given IPP sentences.</p>\n<p>He described the situation as \"draconian and unfair\".</p>\n<p>\"I've had clients who on the face of it without IPP sentences might have faced fixed term sentences of four or five years which gives them a definite release date,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"But if you have an IPP it's effectively for life. Many subjected to them get recalled sometimes for the most minor sentences.\"</p>\n<p>Mr Taylor said there needed to be a \"large scale resentencing\" of people who were subject to IPPs.</p>\n<p>While he said not all those subject to them would otherwise have been released immediately, \"there was no longer a need to have people locked up like this\".</p>\n<p>\"These people become hopeless, they have no hope on getting out which can lead to violent behaviour in prisons, and we have a radical shortage of prison spaces,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"The first aim of prison should be rehabilitation, and IPP sentences go against that.\"</p>\n<p>Figures from June show there are about 2,500 prisoners who have either never been released or have been recalled to prison under the IPP scheme.</p>\n<p>On Thursday campaigners from Wales, including Shirley Debono whose son Shaun Lloyd was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e5154j4z0o\">handed an IPP sentence aged 18</a>, went to Downing Street to hand over a letter calling for the sentences to be abolished retrospectively, and for those still affected to be resentenced.</p>\n<p>The group have also filed a case against the UK government before the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.</p>\n<p>In the letter, the campaigners urged the government to \"do the right thing by ending one of the greatest miscarriages of justice and restore hope and justice to thousands of IPP prisoners and their families\".</p>\n<p>The added children had \"grown up separated from their parents, not knowing when or if they will ever see them again\".</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yev505n5wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Britain's engineering firm Rolls Royce has been selected to design and build the first in the country.</p>\n    <p>One of the commercial deals set to be signed this week is with US nuclear group X-Energy and the UK's Centrica, which owns British Gas, to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool.</p>\n    <p>Unlike SMRs, which are water-cooled nuclear reactors, advanced modular reactors use gases such as helium as a coolant.</p>\n    <p>There are very few AMRs in the world operating on a commercial basis such as China's HTR-PM reactor.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy wants to build one in the US but, after announcing a partnership with US chemicals and plastics giant Dow in 2021, it has taken until March this year to submit a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project in Texas.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy has said it hopes the reactor at a Dow site could be a blueprint for others and \"manufacturers worldwide could replicate this model\".</p>\n    <p>The government said the Hartlepool deal has the potential to power 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 jobs.</p>\n    <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid, skilled jobs for working people.\"</p>\n    <p>But Greenpeace questioned the UK's focus on nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>\"If these proposals for new reactors scattered around Britain really materialise, the net effect will be higher bills from nuclear's relentlessly spiralling costs, and more CO2 as we wait for the builders to overcome their inevitable construction delays,\" said Dr Douglas Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK.</p>\n    <p>The cost of building large nuclear plants in the UK, such as Sizewell C in Suffolk, has jumped to Â£38bn from a previous estimate of Â£20bn. Centrica is one of the key investors in Sizewell C.</p>\n    <p>SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity, but have around a third of the generating output.</p>\n    <p>The modular element means they could be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station.</p>\n    <p>However, the SMR industry is still young, and many different designs are being investigated.</p>\n    <p>Centrica's chief executive Chris O'Shea told the BBC's Today programme that increased costs and delays \"can happen in all large projects\".</p>\n    <p>But he said: \"What you need to do is you need to do more than just one every 20 years in order to get better. So, the more you practice, the better you get which is why small and advanced modular reactors are particularly interesting because they'll be repetitive so you'll produce the same thing over and over again.</p>\n    <p>\"That should bring improvements both in terms of cost and schedule and reliability and cost as well.\"</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he wants the UK to return <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o\">to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\"</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzevzwxwro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Baroness Amos says she will aim to produce interim findings around Christmas.</p>\n<p>The review will examine the experience of families and staff within England's struggling maternity services and investigate why the recommendations from previous maternity inquiries in Morecambe Bay, East Kent, and Shrewsbury and Telford have not led to sustained improvements.</p>\n<p>Past inquiries have revealed issues including ignoring women's voices, poor leadership, a failure to learn from safety incidents and a toxic culture. Yet families are still repeatedly reporting substandard care.</p>\n<p>There will also be \"particular attention\" paid to examining why black and Asian families have noticeably poorer outcomes, Baroness Amos said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Health said the trusts had been chosen based on data analysis and the views of families, as well as to ensure a geographical and demographic mix.</p>\n<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the focus on these trusts would \"create real anxiety among women, families and staff\" at the 14 trusts.</p>\n<p>It added that the review would need to re-build a world class maternity system.</p>\n<p>\"Too many women and babies are not getting the safe, compassionate care they deserve and the maternity workforce is on its knees, with staff leaving the profession,\" said the college's president, Prof Ranee Thakar.</p>\n<p>The strongest criticism of the review, however, comes from the Maternity Safety Alliance (MSA) - a group of families harmed by poor maternity care in several NHS trusts across England.</p>\n<p>Having engaged in a number of meetings with the Department of Health in recent weeks, they said Streeting had \"broken promises\" over how the investigation would be run and what it would examine, and that they had been left feeling \"used\".</p>\n<p>They are particularly critical of the decision not to investigate the role of NHS regulators, such as the Care Quality Commission and NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance and litigation arm.</p>\n<p>\"The review seems to have already decided that all the responsibility for these 800 deaths a year lies squarely with NHS trusts and the clinicians who work in them,\" said Tom Hender, who lost his son Aubrey in 2022.</p>\n<p>\"That's just not true - the whole system is in crisis and we need a whole system approach.\"</p>\n<p>The MSA said the investigation was \"not fit for purpose\" and will not achieve what Streeting said it would, adding: \"It is clear that only a statutory public inquiry can end the crisis in maternity care.\"</p>\n<p>Baroness Amos said the terms of the review were extensive given its time frame and that regulatory bodies were \"not excluded\", but added: \"The kind of in-depth review that is being requested is not something that I am able to conduct.\"</p>\n<p>The two families who successfully campaigned for an investigation into maternity care in Shrewsbury and Telford are more positive about the review, describing it as \"an important and brave first step\".</p>\n<p>But the parents of Kate Stanton-Davies and Pippa Griffiths also said it would be \"safer\" if the review proceeded at a slower pace, adding that proper mental health support had to be provided to those families sharing their experiences.</p>\n<p>\"It's not enough to have a nominal support figure in the room and an email address for follow-up,\" they said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The ongoing challenges facing maternity services were highlighted last week.</p>\n<p>On Monday, a review of care at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS trust found that the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rvqd7v52ro\">nine babies</a> between 2020 and 2023 could have been prevented.  </p>\n<p>Then on Friday, a report found that NHS trusts rated over half their maternity and neonatal buildings as being unsatisfactory, with 7% saying they ran a serious risk of imminent breakdown.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg6xj1vz70o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They won the ball back four or five times high up the pitch and, with a bit more finesse in those counter-attacks, they could have scored themselves.</p>\n<p>One of the problems with Amorim's 3-4-2-1 is the two holding midfielders can be outnumbered but that did not happen at Etihad Stadium because Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, who were playing either side of Benjamin Sesko, dropped in.</p>\n<p>The team narrowed up which helped Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, because there were no big gaps.</p>\n<p>Most of the time the defence and the midfield were close to each other too, rather than the defence dropping off like they did last season because of a lack of pace or confidence.</p>\n<p>City did not completely play through them and tear them apart, and that's not how they scored their first goal either.</p>\n<p>What happened there is that you have got Fernandes, arguably one of the best number 10s in the world, playing in a deeper centre-midfield role as a number eight when his instincts are not defensive.</p>\n<p>A simple run off the back from Foden was all it took to lose him.</p>\n<p>Bruno Fernandes was watching Jeremy Doku, not Phil Foden when the Belgian winger reached the byeline</p>\n<p>Yes, you could argue Luke Shaw might have done better when the ball was in the box but Foden is free by that point, because Fernandes switched off.</p>\n<p>As I highlighted on Match of the Day, he is ball-watching when the cross comes over. I don't think he is lazy, because he is back in position.</p>\n<p>He is just not used to spotting runners and seeing danger.</p>\n<p>Doku put over a cross and found the unmarked Foden who was bursting into the box</p>\n<p>That's the second time he has cost United a goal this season, because he also failed to track Emile Smith Rowe for Fulham's equaliser when they dropped points at Craven Cottage in August.</p>\n<p>The irony with Fernandes against City was that certain aspects of his play in the middle of the pitch were extremely good.</p>\n<p>It's not a totally stupid idea to play him there, because his passing from deep is tremendous to find the runners ahead of him, and he is technically excellent as well as being brave on the ball.</p>\n<p>The problem is what happens without it. A player of his intelligence should be able to learn to switch on a bit more in defensive situations too, but it's clearly not happening.</p>\n<p>You just can't play in that role if that's a regular occurrence for you, and it is down to the manager to recognise that and put players in there who do it better.</p>\n<h2>More square pegs in round holes?</h2>\n<p>Man Utd a team with round pegs in square holes - analysis</p>\n<p>Fernandes is not the only United player I look at and think he is a square peg in a round hole.</p>\n<p>Shaw has played in a back three before but he has spent the majority of his career as a dynamic left-back and it feels like he is being shoe-horned into a centre-back position under Amorim.</p>\n<p>Again you can argue he should have the quality to adapt, and for Jeremy Doku to beat him so easily for the first goal was poor defending whether you are a left-back or a centre-half, but if any players are not completely comfortable in their roles, then it is going to affect the team.</p>\n<p>For City's second goal, again it was not down to the United system failing, more a mixture of things - and a multitude of individual mistakes.</p>\n<p>Ugarte starts off on Foden but then follows the ball, like he did in the City move that led to their opener, and goes to press Nico O'Reilly, leaving Foden free.</p>\n<p>From there it's a knock-on effect.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2x70gqllro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Warning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (Â£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to.</p>\n<p>Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposÃ©s of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.</p>\n<p>Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.</p>\n<p>Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels.</p>\n<p>At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p>\n<p>We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Outside of the UK you can</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OboT09uRw6M\">watch on YouTube</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda.</p>\n<p>She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022.</p>\n<p>\"[His] place was like a marketâ€¦ There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us.</p>\n<p>Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.</p>\n<p>\"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him Â£2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled.</p>\n<p>\"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia.</p>\n<p>\"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\"</p>\n<p>Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (Â£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.</p>\n<p>Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes.</p>\n<p>\"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly.</p>\n<p>Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent.</p>\n<p>\"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, Â£3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, Â£1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces.</p>\n<p>Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish.</p>\n<p>\"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\"</p>\n<p>Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\"</p>\n<p>We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply.</p>\n<p>Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.</p>\n<p>Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media.</p>\n<p>But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle.</p>\n<p>To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.</p>\n<p>\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-mindedâ€¦ they can do pretty much everything.\"</p>\n<p>He explained the cost - from $1,000 (Â£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\".</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r9y3kxy9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Shahnaz went into labour, her husband Abdul called a taxi to take them to the only medical facility accessible to them.</p>\n<p>\"She was in a lot pain,\" he says.</p>\n<p>A 20-minute drive away, the clinic was in Shesh Pol village in Afghanistan's north-eastern Badakhshan province. It was where their two older children were born.</p>\n<p>Abdul sat next to Shahnaz comforting her as they drove over gravel tracks to reach help.</p>\n<p>\"But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed. I didn't know it had shut down,\" he said, his face crumpling with agony.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Warning: Readers may find some details in this article distressing.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>\n<p>A single-storey structure with four small rooms, white paint peeling off its walls, the Shesh Pol clinic has USAID posters tacked up everywhere with information and guidance for pregnant women and new mothers.</p>\n<p>It doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider programme implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.</p>\n<p>It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month. It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services.</p>\n<p>Other medical facilities are simply too far from Abdul's village, and it was not without risk for Shahnaz to travel on bumpy roads. Abdul also didn't have money to pay for a longer journey - renting the taxi cost 1,000 Afghani ($14.65; Â£12.70), roughly a quarter of his monthly income as a labourer. So they decided to return home.</p>\n<p>\"But the baby was coming and we had to stop by the side of the road,\" Abdul said.</p>\n<p>Shahnaz delivered their baby girl in the car. Shortly after, she died, bleeding profusely. A few hours later, before she could be named, their baby also died.</p>\n<p>\"I wept and screamed. My wife and child could've been saved if the clinic was open,\" said Abdul. \"We had a hard life, but we were living it together. I was always happy when I was with her.\"</p>\n<p>He doesn't even have a photo of Shahnaz to hold on to.</p>\n<p>There's no certainty the mother and baby would've survived if they'd been treated at the clinic, but without it, they didn't stand a chance, underlining the undeniable impact of US aid cuts in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>For decades, America has been the largest donor to Afghanistan, and in 2024, US funds made up a staggering 43% of all aid coming into the country.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has justified withdrawing it, saying there were \"credible and longstanding concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including... the Taliban\", who govern the country. The US government further added that <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-april-8-2025\">they had reports stating</a> that at least $11m were \"being siphoned or enriching the Taliban\".</p>\n<p>The report that the US State Department referenced <a href=\"https://www.sigar.mil/Reports/Category/24950/\">was made by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</a> (SIGAR). It said that $10.9m of US taxpayer money had been paid to the Taliban-controlled government by partners of USAID in \"taxes, fees, duties, or utilities\".</p>\n<p>The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands.</p>\n<p>\"This allegation is not true. The aid is given to the UN, and through them to NGOs in provinces. They identify who needs the aid, and they distribute it themselves. The government is not involved,\" said Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha.</p>\n<p>The Taliban government's policies, especially its restrictions on women, the harshest in the world, have meant that after four years in power, it is still not recognised by most of the world. It's also a key reason donors have been increasingly walking away from the country.</p>\n<p>The US insists no one has died because of aid cuts. Shahnaz and her baby's deaths are not recorded anywhere. Neither are countless others.</p>\n<p>The BBC has documented at least half a dozen first-hand, devastating accounts in areas where USAID-supported clinics have shut down.</p>\n<p>Right next to Shahnaz's grave, villagers who had gathered around us pointed to two other graves. They told us both were of women who died in childbirth in the past four months â€“ Daulat Begi and Javhar. Their babies survived.</p>\n<p>Not far from the graveyard, we met Khan Mohammad whose wife, 36-year-old Gul Jan, died in childbirth five months ago. Their baby boy Safiullah died three days later.</p>\n<p>\"When she became pregnant, she would go to the clinic for check-ups. But midway through her pregnancy it shut down. During the delivery she had a lot of pain and blood loss,\" Khan Mohammad said. \"My children are sad all the time. No one can give them the love of a mother. I miss her every day. We had a sweet and loving life together.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgqdneev1no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The nights are drawing in, the tans are fading and we all need a bit of sparkle in our lives as we head into autumn.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Never fear, Strictly Come Dancing is back with its 23rd series, with 15 new contestants ready to dust off their dancing shoes.</p>\n<p>Following last year's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz47pp1qwl7o\">controversies relating to the behaviour of some professional dancers</a>, plus a recently launched <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ge98v7j80o\">investigation into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3p58rm8go\">unnamed star being arrested on suspicion of rape</a> (it is understood the development is not related to the upcoming series), BBC bosses will be keen for fans and media to return to talking about the show itself.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, the press gathered for an annual event which gives journalists a chance to speak to all the contestants ahead of the show launch (well, almost all, more on that later).</p>\n<p>Here's all the behind-the-scenes gossip we found out from the likes of Dani Dyer, Vicky Pattison and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.</p>\n<h2>On being 'Strictified'</h2>\n<p>One of the big attractions for most celebrity contestants on the show is the chance to glam up to the max every Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Former Love Island star Dani Dyer says she's game for any dance costume.</p>\n<p>\"I can't wait to be a bit sexy, I've been a mum... my oldest is four... am I sexy?,\" she giggles.</p>\n<p>\"On Love Island I never wore the thong bikinis and now I'm like 'Why didn't I do that?\"</p>\n<p>Dani in a carnival thong number for the samba?

How on earth can you \"Strictify\" a drag performer?</p>\n<p>\"I might be the only one that dresses down on a live show! I want the full Strictly experience.

I don't want to do the dancing, just the dressing up bit!\"</p>\n<h2>Keeping control of the nerves</h2>\n<p>Former Geordie Shore star and podcast host Vicky Pattison has always been very open about her struggles with anxiety, recently revealing on her podcast Get A Grip that she had gone back to therapy to deal with Strictly nerves.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone's handling me with kid gloves at the moment, I keep getting loads of cuddles off everyone.</p>\n<p>\"I'm scared, a little bit overwhelmed. I think it's because I've wanted to do this show for so long, I'm a big fan. I'm desperate to make the most of it... but I'm worried I'll get in my own head.\"</p>\n<p>But support from the likes of former contestants Pete Wicks and her podcast co-host Angela Scanlon is helping.</p>\n<p>\"With Pete, our careers, there's a lot of parallels, we both come from reality TV and there's this common misconception that we're not very talented or capable of anything.

I think I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.\"</p>\n<p>Social media star George Clarke says the nerves haven't hit him - yet.</p>\n<p>\"I don't really get nervous until it's just about to happen, which is nice, until it's just about to happen! Nice build-up and then a breakdown in the dressing room!\"</p>\n<p>Model, actress and influencer Ellie Goldstein says she's \"excited and nervous but nerves are good. I'm so competitive, I want to win!\"</p>\n<p>And Dani's famous dad Danny Dyer will be cheering her on.</p>\n<p>\"Dad is so excited for me, he loves the show. He came to support when Rose Ayling Ellis (his on-screen daughter in EastEnders) was doing it and it was emotional then. He loves a dance himself. I should get him up!\"</p>\n<h2>The Strictly curse</h2>\n<p>None of the contestants seemed bothered about the so-called Strictly curse, which refers to several former contestants who were already in relationships and ended up finding romance with fellow participants.</p>\n<p>In fact, La Voix jokes: \"Bring it on, I'm single!\"</p>\n<p>Dyer points to the fact she's only just got married earlier this year (to West Ham footballer Jarrod Bowen), so has no concerns.</p>\n<p>ER and Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston quips: \"I'm at the age where I don't have to worry about that!\" Come on Alex, 62 is nothing these days.</p>\n<p>Former footballer and manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink says his wife won't be bothered in the slightest.</p>\n<p>\"Take him, take the old fart, take him!\"</p>\n<h2>Thomas is a no-show</h2>\n<p>Sadly, we didn't get the chance to chat to former Apprentice star and social media personality Thomas Skinner, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1l8vnzmeqpo\">later apologised for picking up a journalist's phone before he walked out of the event.</a></p>\n<p>But Thomas also made it clear that he is staying on the line-up, stressing that he \"can't wait to give it my all on that dancefloor\".</p>\n<p>He'll no doubt be keen for his feet to do the talking from now on.</p>\n<h2>Does previous dance experience <i>really</i> help?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r4j2elldo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A trade war with its largest economic partner, a faltering economy - and a lot of promises to deliver on.</p>\n<p>These are only some of the high-stake tests facing Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney as parliament returns for the autumn sitting on Monday.</p>\n<p>Here is a look at some of the political pressures on his Liberal government's horizon.</p>\n<h2>Voters want action on lofty pledges</h2>\n<p>Carney's Liberals made a series of lofty promises during the recent election campaign, from making Canada's economy the strongest in the G7 to \"turbo-charging\" major infrastructure projects and massively ramping up housing development.</p>\n<p>Now, voters are ready to see progress.</p>\n<p>Canadians \"will be looking for clear actions that make a difference, and that's where the rubber will really hit the road for Mark Carney\", said SÃ©bastien Dallaire, an executive vice-president with polling firm Leger.</p>\n<p>There has been some movement on big issues. Last week, the prime minister unveiled the first series of \"nation-building\" projects that Ottawa will review for fast-track approvals - a key part of his wider economic agenda.</p>\n<p>They include a plan to double production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a British Columbia plant, the expansion of part of Montreal's port, and building a small modular nuclear reactor in Ontario.</p>\n<p>Carney has also announced $13bn (Â£6.9bn, $9.4bn) for a new federal housing agency to help build new homes, and vowed to diversify trade away from the US.</p>\n<p>In politics it's usually prudent to under-promise and over-deliver, said Marci Surkes, chief strategy officer at public affairs firm Compass Rose and a former policy director to Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.</p>\n<p>\"Mr Carney has taken quite a different tack, where he has really set the bar very high in terms of expectations,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She added: \"There's already impatience from those who are waiting to see results.\"</p>\n<h2>Economic woes surpass Trump fears</h2>\n<p>Anxiety around an unpredictable US president helped propel Carney to power last April.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump has since imposed punishing tariffs on some sectors of the economy, like steel and autos, but has granted a majority of Canadian goods a broad tariff exemption under the current US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal.</p>\n<p>Mr Dallaire said Canadians know it won't be \"an easy ride\" for the next few years.</p>\n<p>\"The question has turned to: 'OK, what now?'\"</p>\n<p>Recent opinion polling suggests that voters are feeling less panicked by Trump but increasingly worried about the economy.</p>\n<p>Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.1% last month, a level not seen since 2016, excluding the pandemic, and economic growth slowed sharply over the summer, contracting by 1.6%.</p>\n<p>A poll released by Abacus Data this month indicates that six in 10 respondents felt the Ottawa government was too focused on the US president at the expense of pressing concerns like housing, healthcare, and affordability.</p>\n<p>Still, for Carney, there's some silver lining. Many don't blame him directly for the economic shocks of Trump's policies - but they will be watching how the prime minister navigates what he has called a \"rupture\" in the global economy.</p>\n<p>\"A souring economy will become a drag on the popularity of the government, but it really depends to what extent it happens and to what extent Canadians see visible changes,\" said Mr Dallaire.</p>\n<h2>An opposition leader back in the saddle</h2>\n<p>Pierre Poilievre is making his return to the House of Commons.</p>\n<p>The Conservative leader lost his long-held seat in the April election to a Liberal challenger and was forced to spend his summer seeking a path back to parliament.</p>\n<p>In August, he won a by-election in Alberta, securing a new seat and a chance to be a foil for Carney in the House.</p>\n<p>\"The real fighting match is about to begin, and Mr Carney is going to have to swat away or figure out how to handle the punches that will be coming at him,\" said Ms Surkes.</p>\n<p>In an open letter to Carney last week, Poilievre set the stage, saying: \"So far, you have been judged only by the lofty things you have promised to do one day, not by what you have done.\"</p>\n<p>Poilievre has sharply focused his message on cost-of-living and crime issues and he plans to target the Liberals - who have been in power since 2015 - on their record, as well as on immigration.</p>\n<p>That includes pushing them on the number of temporary foreign workers allowed into the country, a programme that has seen a significant expansion in recent years.</p>\n<h2>An 'austerity' warning</h2>\n<p>An \"austerity and investment\" federal budget is expected later this autumn - a financial balancing act Carney has said is possible with \"discipline\".</p>\n<p>The prime minister has criticised government spending under Trudeau as \"unsustainable\" and has asked his finance minister to find programme spending cuts across departments that would increase to 15% reductions over the next three years.</p>\n<p>\"We need to rein in spending. We need to find efficiencies,\" Carney has said.</p>\n<p>But the prime minister will also have to find a way to deliver on major commitments, including a multi-billion dollar increase in defence spending promised to Nato partners, notably the US.</p>\n<p>It comes amid lower revenues from tariffs and other financial challenges, likely leaving officials \"shaking every couch cushion loose for change\", said Ms Surkes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2700vzrko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
