    "body": "<p>A collaboration between African and American researchers and a community living in one of the most hostile landscapes of northern Kenya has uncovered key genetic adaptations that explain how pastoralist people have been able to thrive in the region.</p>\n<p>Underlying the population’s abilities to live in Turkana, a place defined by extreme heat, water scarcity and limited vegetation, has been hundreds of years of natural selection, according to a study <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv2467\">published in Science</a>.</p>\n<p>It shows how the activity of key human genes has changed over millennia and the findings place “Turkana and sub-Saharan Africa at the forefront of genomic research, a field where Indigenous populations have historically been underrepresented”, according to Charles Miano, one of the study’s co-authors and a postgraduate student at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya\">Kenya</a> Medical Research Institute (Kemri).</p>\n<p>The research sequenced 367 whole genomes and analysed more than 7m genetic variants, identifying several regions of the genome under natural selection. It was conducted through the <a href=\"https://turkanahgp.com/index.html\">Turkana Health and Genomics Project</a> (THGP), an initiative bringing together researchers from Kenya and the US, including Kemri, the <a href=\"https://www.turkanabasin.org/\">Turkana Basin Institute</a> (TBI), Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>The genomic analysis found eight regions of DNA that had undergone natural selection but one gene, STC1<i>,</i> expressed in the kidneys, showed exceptionally strong evidence of humans adapting to extreme environments. Evidence included the body’s response to dehydration and processing purine-rich foods such as meat and blood, staples of the Turkana people’s diet.</p>\n<p>Turkana stretches across a large swathe of northern Kenya, one of the most arid regions in the world, where shade is scarce and water even more rare. Rainfall arrives in short, unpredictable bursts, and securing enough water for themselves and their herds of cattle, goats and camels is a daily chore. Fetching water can involve journeys of many hours each day across hot terrain devoid of vegetation.</p>\n<p>About 70% to 80% of the community’s diet comes from animal sources, mostly milk, blood and meat, reflecting resourcefulness and adaptation to scarcity, which is common among pastoralist societies around the world living in environments where crops cannot grow and where markets are too far away to be accessed on foot.</p>\n<p>Yet, after years of documenting the Turkana people’s lifestyle and studying blood and urine samples to assess their health, researchers found that, although the community consumes too much purine, which should lead to gout, the condition rarely appears among the Turkana.</p>\n<p>“About 90% of the people assessed were dehydrated but generally healthy,” said Prof Julien Ayroles, from the University of California, Berkeley, one of the project’s co-principal investigators. “The Turkana have maintained their traditional way of life for thousands of years, providing us with an extraordinary window into human adaptation.”</p>\n<p>Genetic adaptations are believed to have emerged about 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the aridification of northern Africa, the study suggesting that as the region became drier, natural selection favoured variants that enhanced survival under arid conditions.</p>\n<p>“This research demonstrates how our ancestors adapted to dramatic climate shifts through genetic evolution,” said Dr Epem Esekon, responsible for Turkana county’s health and sanitation sector.</p>\n<p>However, as more members of the Turkana community move to towns and cities, the same adaptations that once protected them may now increase risks of chronic lifestyle diseases, a phenomenon known as “<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6109377/\">evolutionary mismatch</a>”. This occurs when adaptations shaped by one environment become liabilities in another, highlighting how rapid lifestyle changes interact with deep evolutionary history.</p>\n<p>When the researchers compared biomarkers and gene expression – the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function<i>  – </i>in the genomes of city-dwelling Turkana people with their kin still living in the villages, they found an imbalance of gene expression that may predispose them to chronic diseases such as hypertension or obesity, which are more common in urban settings where diets, water availability and activity patterns are radically different.</p>\n<p>“Understanding these adaptations will guide health programmes for the Turkana, especially as some shift from traditional pastoralism to city life,” said Miano.</p>\n<p>As the world faces rapid environmental change, the Turkana people’s story offers inspiration and practical insights. For generations, the researchers said, this community has developed and maintained sophisticated strategies for surviving in a challenging and variable environment, knowledge that becomes increasingly valuable as the climate crisis creates new survival challenges.</p>\n<p>For close to a decade, the project centred on co-production of knowledge, combining genomic science with ecological and anthropological expertise. The agenda emerged from dialogue with Turkana elders, scientists, chiefs and community members, conversations about health, diet and change, often in the evening around a campfire.</p>\n<p>“Working with the Turkana has been transformative for this study,” said Dr Sospeter Ngoci Njeru, a co-principal investigator and deputy director at Kemri’s Centre for Community Driven Research. “Their insights into their environment, lifestyle and health have been essential to connecting our genetic findings to real-world biology and survival strategies.”</p>\n<p>Dr Dino Martins, director of the TBI, says the deep ecological connection and the adaptation to one of the Earth’s hottest and most arid environments provides lessons for how climate continues to shape human biology and health. “The discovery adds another important piece of knowledge to our wider understanding of human evolution,” he said.</p>\n<p>Researchers say other pastoralist communities in similar environments in east Africa, including the Rendille, Samburu, Borana, Merille, Karamojong and Toposa, are likely to share this adaptation.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/19/kenya-turkana-people-genetically-adapted-to-live-in-harsh-environment-study-suggests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She also runs a Christian clothing line called Proclaim.</p>\n<h3>How did Erika and Charlie Kirk meet?</h3>\n<p>The couple's first date, in September 2018, started as a job interview.</p>\n<p>They met initially during a brief <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg--Gnj027/\">meeting</a> at the opening of the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, where she had applied for a job. Shortly after, Charlie Kirk <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOg--Gnj027/\">invited her to dinner</a> during a visit to New York City, where she was living at the time. He chose a burger restaurant, and they sat \"deep in conversation and banter over theology, philosophy and politics,\" <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw0f4Dkpvur/?img_index=1\">Erika later recalled</a>.</p>\n<p>After her husband's death, she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOpOuoQCY6v/?hl=en\">posted a video</a> of him telling the story to their daughter as she sits on his lap in the same restaurant.</p>\n<p>\"I was asking all these questions … philosophy, religion, Jesus,\" Charlie Kirk explains. \"And then I realized Mama was beautiful and smart and elegant and Christ-like, and so I said, 'Forget this job interview, I want to date you.'\"</p>\n<p>The two <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CITUZQ1HF13/\">got engaged</a> in December 2020 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPTpDUuHSJz/\">and married</a> in May 2021.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546856/erika-kirk-ceo-turning-point-usa-charlie-kirk-death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>America's late-night TV hosts have rallied behind fellow comedian Jimmy Kimmel after he was suspended by ABC in a row over comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk.</p>\n<p>Stephen Colbert began his show by saying \"we are all Jimmy Kimmel\", and said the star's removal was a \"blatant assault on freedom of speech\".</p>\n<p>Seth Meyers declared it was \"a privilege and honour to call Jimmy Kimmel my friend\", while Jon Stewart and Jimmy Fallon tackled the free speech issue by doing satirical sketches in which they were apparently forced to praise Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Their broadcasts came shortly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4qe0rz2zvo\">after the US president said</a> the main networks were overwhelmingly negative about him and could have their licences \"taken away\".</p>\n<p>For years, Trump has focused on those in the media who he views as his opponents.</p>\n<p>Is Kimmel's suspension an attack on free speech? A sign of another media company bowing to Trump's assault? Or a long overdue reckoning? It depends on whose side you are on.</p>\n<p>This latest decision has sent a chill through liberal America - and encouraged the president's supporters who have long railed against the late-night talk show hosts who criticise him.</p>\n<p>The row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on Monday that the \"Maga gang\" were \"desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them\" and trying to \"score political points from it\".</p>\n<p>He also likened Trump's reaction to the conservative political activist's death to \"how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish\".</p>\n<p>Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates network TV, called those comments \"sick\". Carr said he had threatened to take action because the host had appeared to \"directly mislead the American public\".</p>\n<p>Conservative critics say Kimmel was pushing a false narrative by suggesting Kirk's suspected killer was a \"Make America Great Again\" Republican. While the exact motive is still not known, on Sunday - before Kimmel spoke - the Utah governor had said the suspect was \"indoctrinated by leftist ideology\".</p>\n<p>Meyers, the host of NBC's Late Night, began his show on Thursday by saying Trump's administration was \"pursuing a crackdown on free speech\", before adding sarcastically: \"And completely unrelated, I just want to say before we get started here that I've always admired and respected Mr Trump.\"</p>\n<p>To audience laughter, Meyers continued: \"I've always believed he was a visionary, an innovator, a great president and an even better golfer.\"</p>\n<p>The host went on to play a succession of clips of Trump declaring he had banned government censorship and brought back free speech in America.</p>\n<p>After playing further clips about the Kimmel situation, Meyers said: \"It is a privilege and honour to call Jimmy Kimmel my friend, in the same way it's a privilege and honour to do this show every night.</p>\n<p>\"I wake up every day and I count my blessings to live in a country that at least purports to value freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>\"And we're going to keep doing our show the way we've always done it - with enthusiasm and integrity...\" That was followed by a fart noise, referring to a previous joke about a horse defecating in front of Trump during his state visit to the UK.</p>\n<p>Returning to his point, Meyers continued: \"This is a pivotal... this is a big moment in our democracy and we must all stand up for freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>\"There is a reason free speech is in the very First Amendment. It stands above all others.\"</p>\n<p>On CBS, The Late Show presenter Colbert said: \"To Jimmy, I say I stand with you and your staff 100%.\"</p>\n<p>He said Kimmel's suspension was \"blatant censorship\" and the \"latest and boldest action in a long campaign against media critics\".</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20n4q0q9zqo\">Colbert has had his own show cancelled</a> - it will end in May, so he's got free rein for months to say almost what he wants.</p>\n<p>CBS said in July that cancelling The Late Show was \"purely a financial decision\", but some observers have linked the move to a looming federal decision on a merger involving CBS's parent company, Paramount.</p>\n<p>Kimmel's removal came after Nexstar Media, one of America's largest TV station owners, said it would not air Kimmel's show \"for the foreseeable future\" because his remarks had been \"offensive and insensitive\". Nexstar is also currently awaiting federal approval for a separate takeover deal.</p>\n<p>\"So a company apparently capitulating to the whims of the president in order to ensure their merger goes through - has that ever happened before?\" Colbert joked.</p>\n<p>\"Everything is about corporate relationships.\"</p>\n<p>Following his state visit, Trump told reporters of late night shows and networks: \"All they do is hit Trump... They are licensed. They are not allowed to do that.\"</p>\n<p>Colbert responded: \"Yes they are! Since the beginning... these shows have always talked about the current president, and that happens to be you.\"</p>\n<p>He added: \"So no matter what they claim, this is not entirely about what Jimmy said on Monday, this was part of a plan. How do I know that? Two months ago, when the president was tastefully celebrating my cancellation, he posted 'Jimmy Kimmel is next to go'.\"</p>\n<p>And that's exactly what happened.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyxjve3pe2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The UK military is focused on defending the nation rather than stopping asylum seekers from crossing the Channel, a cabinet minister has said.</p>\n<p>US President Donald Trump suggested that military intervention could be used to deal with illegal migration to the UK during his state visit this week.</p>\n<p>But Trade Secretary Peter Kyle has rejected that call, telling BBC Breakfast the UK Border Force has specific responsibility for policing UK borders.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of migrants attempted to cross the Channel earlier on Friday, as the second deportation under the government's \"one in, one out\" deal with France took place.</p>\n<p>Six boats are believed to have set off from northern France, as the smugglers made the most of a break in the windy weather in the Channel. There had been no crossings for a week before then due to choppy seas.</p>\n<p>People were then seen being taken from the Port of Dover by coach, including two small children.</p>\n<p>On Friday morning, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx273vnkjpmo\">an Eritrean man became the second migrant to be deported under the government's deal with France</a>, after he lost a High Court bid to halt his removal.</p>\n<p>The Home Office tightened the rules around human trafficking claims to win that case.</p>\n<p>On Friday afternoon, Home Office sources said an Iranian male had also been returned to France after crossing the Channel in a small boat.</p>\n<p>Speaking at a press conference at Chequers on Thursday, Trump suggested military force was a better deterrent than the Labour government's approach of diplomatic negotiations agreeing returns and toughening up court guidance.</p>\n<p>Speaking alongside Sir Keir Starmer at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, Trump suggested such force was needed as illegal migration \"destroys countries from within\".</p>\n<p>He said: \"You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use.\"</p>\n<p>Asked about the US president's claims, Kyle told BBC Breakfast: \"Well, what he suggested was the military are used, but we have the UK Border Force that is now established and has been reinforced and bolstered and have new powers under this government.</p>\n<p>\"The navy actually does have a working relationship with the UK Border Force, and the navy can be called upon if needed, so we do have the functional relationship that we need between our military and keeping our borders safe and secure.</p>\n<p>\"But what we really need at the moment is our military focused on all of those really key issues around the world, directly relating to our national defence.\"</p>\n<p>Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge dismissed Trump's suggestion that military could be used to cut illegal migration, saying it would be \"extremely complicated\".</p>\n<p>He told BBC Look East that \"we have a border force…we need a deterrent\" and cited the Conservative government's Rwanda plan, which he said would have been \"extremely effective\".</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67423745\">Supreme Court ruled that the African country could not be considered to be safe at all</a>, because of human rights abuses, and the plan was scrapped almost immediately after Labour took office last year.</p>\n<h2>'Different geography'</h2>\n<p>Trump has issued a series of executive orders implementing a broad ban on asylum for migrants entering at the southern US border and has sent in troops to assist border security efforts.</p>\n<p>The arrests of migrants by the US Border Patrol have been decreasing since Trump took office.</p>\n<p>The Conservatives and Reform UK are calling for tougher action on migration, with Reform saying it would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum.</p>\n<p>Neither party has proposed using military force, although Nigel Farage has said a Reform government would tow small boats back to France <a href=\"https://x.com/Peston/status/1964319354918756673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1964319354918756673%7Ctwgr%5Ecd7579bc460fc489d6577092c131e6cd46d2cac0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itv.com%2Fnews%2F2025-09-06%2Ffarage-id-crack-down-on-young-disability-benefits-claimants-if-elected-pm\">\"as an absolute last resort\".</a></p>\n<p>The Ministry of Defence <a href=\"https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2025-05-30/55176\">recently said</a> that military assets had been bought \"for defence tasks\" and were \"not optimised\" to be used in tackling illegal migration.</p>\n<p>General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, cautioned that the involvement of the British military would be limited by the \"very different geography\" involved in migration flows.</p>\n<p>Speaking to The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4, he added: \"I don't think France is going to be very enthusiastic about British troops on French beaches, unless they were very carefully co-ordinated.\"</p>\n<p>He added that the military was unlikely to \"add very much\" to existing efforts to spot boats using commercial drones.</p>\n<p>\"When migrants arrive in the UK, the Home Office has a system for gathering them up and the military would add manpower to that but they're not going to make the problem any different.\"</p>\n<p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to fight what she called \"vexatious, last-minute claims\" and Kyle described her as \"straining at the bit\" to make sure the pilot one-in-one-out scheme for migrant returns was a success.</p>\n<p>\"We're making sure we get as many people as don't have the right to be here returned as swiftly as possible,\" he said, adding there are \"a lot of cases\" going through court.</p>\n<p>Asked whether there was any target figure for the number of returns, Kyle said: \"Our target is to make sure that everybody who comes to our shore and doesn't have the right to stay is removed from the country, that is our target.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n

Other on-the-go food retailers, including Pret a Manger, are also testing consumer appetite for pricier baked goods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/pret-a-manger-launches-salad-revamp\">salads</a>, sandwiches and coffees.</p>\n<p>“There’s a limit to how much people are prepared to pay for certain products,” said Richard Lim, the chief executive of the consultancy Retail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a>. “It’s snapped for some consumers with some products.”</p>\n<p>He said Labour could take some flak. “There’s a level of awareness [among consumers] that a lot of the inflationary pressures they’re facing have been the result of some of the decisions the government have made.”</p>\n<p>At the height of the pastygate scandal, the now chancellor, Rachel Reeves, joined Ed Miliband and Ed Balls – the then Labour leader and shadow chancellor – on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/mar/28/ed-miliband-sausage-rolls-greggs-pasty-video\">trip to Greggs in Redditch</a> for a media stunt at Osborne’s expense. They bought eight sausage rolls (costing a total of £4.70) a day after Osborne <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/mar/28/george-osborne-greggs-pasty-video\">admitted to MPs</a> he could not remember when he last had a Greggs pasty.</p>\n<p>As Reeves prepares her November budget, Greggs sausage rolls are a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/greggs-prices-over-years\">talking point on TikTok</a> among Britons nostalgic for pre-pandemic prices, while the price of Pret sandwiches, salads and coffees are the recurring theme of outraged <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/176tsqa/pret_a_manger/\">Reddit</a> threads.</p>\n<p>Official figures show headline UK inflation is running at 3.8%, the highest rate in the G7 and almost twice the Bank of England’s 2% target. Rising food and drink prices have powered much of the increase, with the rate of food inflation expected to peak above 5% this autumn.</p>\n<p>Prices for fast food and takeaways – including cooked pastry-based snacks, sandwiches and hot drinks – are rising faster than general inflation, with an increase of 33% since 2020.</p>\n<p>Business leaders have said that the £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions has forced them to raise prices, to pass on costs. Any further tax rises would compound the problem, they say.</p>\n<p>But companies could find it harder to squeeze the British consumer with further price increases after the eye-watering rises of the past five years.</p>\n<p>“Consumers are being much more careful,” said Lim. “The big thing for consumers is that, while inflation is down from the peak a few years ago [of 11.1% in late 2022], this does not mean prices are falling. The level is significantly higher.</p>\n<p>“For some categories – on-the-go food and coffee might be one of them – prices are meeting a level where they are really testing that elasticity of demand.”</p>\n<p>This month Pret announced it was caving in to competition from supermarkets by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/pret-a-manger-to-take-on-supermarkets-by-trialling-meal-deals\">launching meal deals</a>, while its owner, JAB, wrote down the value of the chain by a third amid “intense strains” on the hospitality industry.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-18\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Pret raised eyebrows this year after launching a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/pret-a-manger-launches-salad-revamp\">“premium” £12.95 lunchtime salad</a>, having prompted a social media backlash two years ago with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/29/sandwich-price-shocks-but-meal-deal-costs-rise-less-than-average-food-inflation\">£7.15 “posh” cheese and pickle baguette</a>.</p>\n<p>However, its boss, Pano Christou, has hit back against criticism that Pret is <i>trop cher</i>. “We’re not expensive,” he told the Sunday Times last weekend, in an interview defending Pret’s £5.50 baguettes, £3.95 flat whites and £2.90 cups of tea.</p>\n<p>Some of the chain’s prices – including for its £4.50 “classic super club” sandwich, have been cut in the past year, while bosses believe its £8.95 lobster roll is the cheapest on the market, helping its sales to boom.</p>\n<p>The rise of food price inflation is hitting Britain’s poorest households disproportionately hard.</p>\n<p>Official figures released this month show the poorest fifth of households <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/april2023tomarch2024\">slashed their spending on food by 5%</a> in real terms last year. Despite sky-high inflation, the richest fifth maintained their spending.</p>\n<p>The Treasury said it was taking action to help families, including through free breakfast clubs for all primary schoolchildren and expanding free school meals. “We know that while the economy isn’t broken, for working people it feels stuck,” a spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>Despite the mounting pressure on living costs, official figures show household savings remain above pre-pandemic levels.

    "body": "<p>The march towards the darkness is becoming a sprint. In the US, warnings about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/25/donald-trump-next-president-fascist\">autocratic ambitions of Donald Trump</a> that were once dismissed as hyperbole and hysteria now seem, if anything, too mild. Faster than most imagined, he has moved to weaken institutional checks on his power – whether the courts, the universities, the civil service or the press – and now has set to work gagging his critics, even, it seems, to outlaw large swathes of the opposition.</p>\n<p>This week saw the suspension by a major broadcasting network, Disney-owned ABC, of a late-night talkshow, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, following remarks Kimmel had made about the killing of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel did not criticise Kirk himself – an act now considered all but blasphemous in the US – but rather Republicans’ reaction to his murder, especially their eagerness to “score political points from it”.</p>\n<p>That was enough to prompt Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission – the body that grants, or revokes, licences to broadcast – to come on like a wannabe Tony Soprano, all but cracking his knuckles as he said: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” The threat worked: Kimmel is off the air.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is no one-off. Trump is also trying to cow the US’s biggest newspaper, filing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/trump-new-york-times-lawsuit\">a $15bn lawsuit against the New York Times</a>, accusing it of “spreading false and defamatory content”. The NYT has the resources to resist, but smaller US papers will have got the message. They could hardly be blamed if they now pull their journalistic punches, if only because they do not have the money to pay for a protracted legal battle against a billionaire president.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration is not confining its assault to the media. The Kirk killing has handed it an opportunity to crack down on dissent itself. Witness the promise Trump aide Stephen Miller made this week – on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3aatgpV6s0w0kzGjiIOqml?si=I7NT39PNSPO0STVsZNiZiA\">the Charlie Kirk podcast</a> – to take on those left-of-centre organisations whose “messaging” is “designed to trigger and incite violence”. It is hardly a stretch to assume that Miller will define that category very broadly, so that it sweeps up most of those who express opposition to Trump. If that seems alarmist, recall that, even before Kirk was killed, Miller was calling the Democratic party a “<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6377384186112\">domestic extremist organisation</a>”.</p>\n<p>In the UK, we like to think we can watch all this with, if not smug distance, then a measure of relief. It’s true that we are a long way from the precipice to which Trump has taken the US. But last week between 110,000 and 150,000 Britons took to the streets of London, heeding the summons of the rightwing agitator and <a href=\"https://theweek.com/crime/tommy-robinson-a-timeline-of-legal-troubles\">serial convict </a>who goes by the name of Tommy Robinson.</p>\n<p>It’s worth stressing that this was not a Reform or Conservative rally that was hijacked by Robinson. This was his event. Britons know who Robinson is and what he represents – and yet up to 150,000 of them marched behind him. They were undeterred by those who had labelled it a far-right protest and, indeed, by the racist rhetoric that came <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/tommy-robinson-rally-whitehall-racist-far-right\">from the platform</a>. Britain has an admirable history of confining the far right to the margins, ensuring that it had not, until now, demonstrated this kind of strength in numbers. So last Saturday should be understood as a watershed.</p>\n<p>Not least because of one speech in particular. Elon Musk, via video link, told the crowd “violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” He added that the Labour government, democratically elected a year ago, needed to be brought down. This was one of the most powerful men in the world issuing a call that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\"> may not have broken the law</a> but which<strong> </strong>seemed to give approval in advance for rightwing political violence in Britain.</p>\n<p>And yet the British prime minister did not rush to condemn this incendiary intrusion into our politics. Indeed, Downing Street said nothing at all until prompted by reporters’ questions, and MPs’ demands, the following day. We often fault those guilty of overreaction. But, at a moment like this, underreaction is the greater sin.</p>\n<p>The polls are telling a very stark story. Absent a dramatic shift, a party of nationalist populism is on course to beat both Labour and the Conservatives at the next election, and very probably form the next government. Nigel Farage may be no fan of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a>, but he is Trump’s loudest UK cheerleader; he does not condemn the current US gallop towards authoritarianism but rather stands alongside those responsible for it. If we want to prevent Farage doing to Britain what Trump is doing to the US, we need to halt the advance of Reform.</p>\n<p>The first move in that effort is to puncture Farage’s core claim: that he somehow speaks for the British people, that his views reflect the “commonsense” views of the silent majority. It’s not true. On issue after issue, including those that define him, Farage is an outlier, articulating the positions of a noisy but often small minority.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/19/donald-trump-us-abyss-nigel-farage-britain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They released an alternative bill that would extend funding only through Oct. 31 but tacks on a range of priorities, including more than $1 trillion in new health care spending through a permanent extension of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act that are <a href=\"https://time.com/7314714/congress-democrats-government-shutdown/\">set to expire</a> at the end of the year; the reversal of Medicaid cuts enacted in the GOP’s <a href=\"https://time.com/7299256/big-beautiful-bill-polling-takeaways/\">Big, Beautiful Bill;</a> and new guardrails to prevent the Trump Administration from freezing or rescinding money that Congress has approved. Their measure also restores nearly half a billion dollars to <a href=\"https://time.com/7307069/corporation-for-public-broadcasting-pbs-npr/\">public broadcasting</a>, lifts the freeze on foreign aid funding, and boosts congressional security funds by more than the GOP measure. </p>\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office has said that the Democratic plan to permanently extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies would increase deficits by nearly $350 billion over the next decade, though around 4 million people would lose coverage starting in 2026 if the credits are to lapse.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>“Republicans appear to believe that health care should be a privilege reserved for the wealthy and the well-connected,” said Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York before the vote. “We strongly disagree.”</p>\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York framed the standoff as a test of whether Republicans would continue to follow Trump’s directives. “Republicans can choose: either listen to Donald Trump and shut the government down, or break this logjam by supporting our bill and keeping the government open,” he said on the Senate floor.</p>\n<p>But hanging in the balance is a looming deadline that federal workers and agencies are closely following. Current funding for the government is set to expire on Sept. 30. If neither chamber can agree on a plan before then, large swaths of the government will shut down, forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://time.com/7318900/house-republicans-pass-shutdown-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A piece of history was made: the first public celebration of a new Jewish<a href=\"https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/UAE\"> community</a> established in the Arab world in over a century. The gathering applauded the normalization of Judaism in the United Arab Emirates, where Jewish residents had previously held the high holidays in an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/12c3573f85754064b8413ae1a6d9785c\">unmarked villa</a>.

The gathering celebrated<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu\"> the Abraham Accords</a>, which had been<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/04/the-abraham-accords-after-gaza-a-change-of-context?lang=en\"> signed</a> with great fanfare on the White House lawn a few days earlier, on Sept. 15, 2020. The agreement established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, starting with the UAE and Bahrain, its fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member, and marked the first time any Arab state had<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/25-years-on-remembering-the-path-to-peace-for-jordan-and-israel/\"> normalized relations</a> with Israel since Jordan in 1994.</p>\n<p>The Abraham Accords were a major win for Israel, and the crowning foreign policy<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/books/review-breaking-history-jared-kushner.html\"> achievement</a> of President Donald Trump’s first term. The agreement promised to integrate Israel into the defense, trade, and technological fabric of multiple Arab states that had, for decades, refused to even establish an embassy on Israeli soil unless it recognized a Palestinian state. For many Palestinians and supporters of their cause, however, it represented a crushing disappointment. </p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>I live and teach in the UAE and witnessed a heady honeymoon between the Emirates and Israel in the<a href=\"https://jweekly.com/2020/10/26/what-ive-learned-about-uae-culture-as-the-chief-rabbis-wife/\"> first few years</a> following the Abraham Accords. Emirati youth delegations<a href=\"https://israel21c.org/young-influencers-put-a-human-face-on-the-abraham-accords/\"> visited</a> Israel; Israeli and Emirati scholars co-presented their work at conferences all over Abu Dhabi; and festive meals were served following the Jewish and Islamic dietary laws when Passover and Ramadan overlapped. I even met young Emiratis studying Hebrew to improve their prospects of working for their own government. Jewish ritual baths, <a href=\"https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/UAE\"> mikvahs</a>, and </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.totallyjewishtravel.com/blog/jewish-travel-destinations-blog/kosher-vacation-in-the-uae-dubai-and-abu-dhabi\">kosher restaurants</a>sprung up swiftly.</p>\n<p>In December 2021, I found myself in a Dubai metro coach with at least 20 Hasidic Jews in their hats and curls, all riding safely. The first winters after the Accords also brought <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/expo-2020/2021/11/29/hanukkah-celebrations-begin-at-israels-expo-2020-pavilion/\">public menorah lightings</a> for Hanukkah, with Emiratis proudly standing by, and sometimes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rVUhoor9Mvs\">lighting the candles</a>, with Jewish community leaders. In central Dubai, I drove past a massive “Visit Israel” billboard, a display that would have been unthinkable elsewhere in the Arab world.

But Blinken wanted Qatar to use its contacts with Hamas to help mediate an agreement to free the Israeli hostages held by the group and potentially reach a ceasefire deal.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>Despite all that, Israel still crossed the Rubicon of <a href=\"https://time.com/7315542/hamas-doha-israel-strike-leadership/\">bombing Qatar</a>. The attack killed five Hamas members and one Qatari security guard; the Hamas leaders whom Israel had <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/senior-hamas-officials-survived-israeli-strikes-doha/story?id=125438560\">targeted</a> in the strike<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/senior-hamas-officials-survived-israeli-strikes-doha/story?id=125438560\"> </a>survived. Most decision makers in the UAE and Qatar did not expect Israel to be audacious enough to attack Doha, or the Trump Administration <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/trump-netanyahu-call-israel-strike-qatar\">incompetent</a> enough to <a href=\"https://time.com/7315803/trump-qatar-israel-decision/\">stop</a>  it.</p>\n<p>The UAE, whose largest city, Dubai, is a seven hour drive from Qatar, viewed the Israeli attack on its neighbor–for doing what Washington wanted–as a truly <a href=\"https://www.alkhaleej.ae/2025-09-09/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A9-6075601/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86\">shocking breach</a> of international norms.

For the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Israel’s attack in Doha signaled an increasingly unhinged impulse to militarily dominate the Middle East, and a contemptuous disregard for the interests of its Arab allies.</p>\n<p>Advertisement</p>\n<p>The mere whisper of violence in its immediate neighborhood, the Emiratis are aware, can send hard-won investments fleeing to quieter climes. For decades, the leaders of the UAE worked to transform its cities into stable, glittering centers of global commerce.

Text messages from Robinson released by authorities said he targeted Kirk because he “had enough of his hatred.”</p>\n<p>Kimmel’s indefinite pre-emption, which has raised concerns about state-sanctioned censorship, came during a week when Trump and other administration officials have vowed to target left-wing organizations and people they believe foment political violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi has<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-pam-bondi-backlash-right-hate-speech-rcna231713\"> raised the possibility</a> of cracking down on “hate speech.” And Vance has<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/stephen-miller-vengeance-charlie-kirk-murder-rcna231329\"> encouraged people</a> to call out and push for the firings of those “celebrating” Kirk’s death.</p>\n<p>Trump, who <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115222372625104790\">celebrated the Kimmel news</a> on social media, was asked about its ramifications for free speech Thursday during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>\n<p>“Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else, and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk,” Trump responded. “Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person. He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So you can call that free speech or not. He was fired for lack of talent.”</p>\n<p>Trump, speaking with reporters later on Air Force One, suggested that television broadcasters he deems unfriendly could lose their FCC licenses.</p>\n<p>Vance has been one of the administration’s loudest champions of free speech and, more recently, one of its loudest voices calling for those disparaging Kirk in death to be punished.</p>\n<p>“The First Amendment protects a lot of very ugly speech, but if you celebrate Charlie Kirk’s death, you should not be protected from being fired for being a disgusting person,” Vance said in an interview that aired Wednesday night on Fox News.</p>\n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/jd-vance/bring-back-vance-says-supports-rehiring-doge-staffer-resigned-racist-s-rcna191224\">Vance advocated</a> for the rehiring of a federal employee who had resigned over social media posts supporting racism and eugenics — “stupid social media activity,” Vance argued then, should not “ruin a kid’s life.” Vance also has accused European allies of undermining the spirit of free speech,<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-german-politics-defense-afd-rcna209177\"> specifically targeting Germany</a> for isolating the AfD, a political party with Nazi echoes.</p>\n<p>“It’s one thing to say that a particular set of views is gross ... or somehow outside the Overton window, outside the bounds of reasonable discourse,” Vance said in an interview in May. “I think that it is very, very dangerous to use the neutral institutions of state — the military, the police forces ... the intel services — to try to delegitimize another competing political party.”</p>\n<p>He added that while he was a “pretty big believer in free speech … I think where I draw the line is encouraging violence against political opponents.”</p>\n<p>Vance has yet to comment on Kimmel’s cancellation, other than<a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1968648808935379126\"> to joke on social media</a> that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who already doubles as Trump’s national security adviser, would be “the new host of ABC’s late night show.”</p>\n<p>During President Joe Biden’s administration, conservatives complained that officials used tactics — similar to those the Trump administration is accused of adopting — to stifle conservative speech, with the threat of adverse consequences if the requests were not honored, a practice known as “jawboning.”</p>\n<p>One key allegation often cited is pressure that Biden officials put on social media companies to remove content, especially as it related to anti-vaccine sentiment.</p>\n<p>That narrative <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-tosses-claim-biden-administration-coerced-social-media-c-rcna151356\">suffered a setback</a> last year when the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling written by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, said various Republican states and individual social media users had failed to adequately allege that the government officials’ requests directly affected social media companies’ content moderation decisions.</p>\n<p>Mindful of how animating a cause cancel culture has been for Republicans in the Trump era, some Democrats are weighing in with alarm.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-republicans-cancel-culture-wars-rcna232152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>WASHINGTON — In a vote that divided Democrats, the House on Friday passed a resolution honoring <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/charlie-kirk-conservative-activist-dead-rcna230451\">slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk</a> and rejecting the political violence of recent years.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025282?Page=2\">vote was 310-58</a>, with 95 Democrats joining all 215 Republicans in voting yes on the nonbinding resolution. The 58 no votes all came from Democrats — mostly members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses — and another 38 Democrats voted present. Another 22 Democrats did not vote.</p>\n<p>The resolution passed nine days after a gunman assassinated the 31-year-old Kirk while he was speaking to a large crowd at Utah Valley University. Kirk was a co-founder of Turning Point USA, which helped turn out the youth vote for Donald Trump in 2024. The alleged shooter has been charged on seven counts, including aggravated murder.</p>\n<p>While all lawmakers have denounced Kirk’s killing, some Democrats had wanted the party to make a more forceful stand against the Kirk resolution, which, among other things, states that his \"commitment to civil discussion and debate stood as a model for young Americans across the political spectrum, and he worked tirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction.\"</p>\n<p>While few spoke out against the resolution publicly before the vote, critics have pointed out that Kirk had disparaged Martin Luther King Jr., called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a “huge mistake” and was a vocal opponent of transgender rights.</p>\n<p>“As a Black woman, the verbal assault on so many Black women coming out of his mouth stunned me,” Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., told NBC News, citing Kirk's <a href=\"https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1679829904026730496?s=20\">past comments questioning the intelligence</a> of former first lady Michelle Obama, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and others. “He insulted so many. This country stands on the shoulders of Black women.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the former chairman of the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, said he also voted no because of Kirk's comments about Black Americans.</p>\n<p>Kirk \"made this <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/charlie-kirk-rose-teenage-activist-maga-star-rcna230943\">horrendous statement</a> that if he gets on a plane and sees a Black pilot, he doesn't know if this is a DEI hire,\" Thompson said. \"So I think that kind of offensive, divisive language is not something that Congress ought to be involved in honoring. Look, again, it was bad he got killed in the way he did. But to try to somehow sanitize [his record]? I just go with the facts.\"</p>\n<p>The issue has not only split Democrats, but also progressive leaders in the party. Rep. Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and a leading progressive voice on Capitol Hill, voted in favor of the resolution. He said that he didn’t agree with every phrase in it, but that this is a moment for both parties to come together.</p>\n<p>“In general, the statement opposes and deplores political violence, and we need to oppose and denounce political violence across the board, in every case, regardless of the victim, regardless of the perpetrator,” Raskin told reporters. “We just have to think about what it means for one of our fellow citizens to lose his life to political violence.”</p>\n<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., an immigrant and a leader of the Progressive Caucus who has been an outspoken critic of Kirk, said after his death that it’s “<a href=\"https://zeteo.com/p/full-of-shit-ilhan-omar-dismisses\">effed up</a>” that people have described Kirk as “just wanting to have a civil debate.”</p>\n<p>Friday's vote ends an <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/raw-emotion-rages-capitol-hill-lawmakers-grapple-charlie-kirks-killing-rcna231666\">emotional and tense week on Capitol Hill</a> as members grappled with Kirk's death. Earlier in the week, the House narrowly rejected a separate GOP resolution to censure Omar and strip her of her committee assignments for criticizing Kirk.</p>\n<p>The broader <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-119hres719ih/pdf/BILLS-119hres719ih.pdf\">five-page resolution</a>, sponsored by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was discussed during House Democrats’ closed-door caucus meeting Thursday. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told rank-and-file members that he and members of his leadership team would vote yes on the Kirk resolution, according to three Democratic sources in the room.</p>\n<p>But Jeffries advised members that they could make up their own minds and vote their conscience, given that it’s such a unique situation, the sources in the room said.</p>\n<p>“The resolution is very down the middle and straightforward,” said a Democratic aide familiar with leadership’s approach to the matter.</p>\n<p>The resolution condemns Kirk’s assassination, offers condolences to his family and praises him as a “courageous American patriot” who peacefully debated his critics in public.</p>\n<p>It honored Kirk for “engaging in respectful, civil discourse across college campuses, media platforms, and national forums, always seeking to elevate truth, foster understanding, and strengthen the Republic\"; exercising his First Amendment rights with “honor, courage, and respect for his fellow Americans”; and working “tirelessly to promote unity without compromising on conviction.”</p>\n<p>​In addition, the resolution also calls upon all political leaders to “stand united in unequivocal condemnation of political violence, regardless of their ideology“ and calls on “all Americans — regardless of race, party affiliation, or creed — to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.”</p>\n<p>Kirk's funeral will be held Sunday in Arizona. The president and other major Republican leaders are expected to attend.</p>\n<p>In a floor speech honoring Kirk, Johnson said the activist was \"never motivated by hatred\" for his political opponents.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democrats-oppose-resolution-honoring-charlie-kirk-condemning-political-rcna232150\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>A Scottish minister has resigned after a row over aggressive gulls spilled over into an angry altercation with the former Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.</p>\n    <p>Jamie Hepburn, the Scottish government’s minister for parliamentary business, tendered his resignation after Ross accused him of assault outside the parliament chamber on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>The former leader of the Scottish Tory leader alleged Hepburn had grabbed him by the shoulder before subjecting him to verbal abuse after Ross had challenged Hepburn over the government’s apparent failure to tackle gull attacks on people in his region.</p>\n    <p>Hepburn denied the assault but acknowledged he used aggressive language, leading Ross to demand an investigation under the ministerial code by John Swinney, the first minister.</p>\n    <p>The altercation was not caught on CCTV but an unnamed MSP from another party backed up Ross’s account. Ross had accused the government of dithering over plans for a summit to tackle “out of control” gulls.</p>\n    <p>Swinney had defended Hepburn, who is widely liked within the Scottish National party and respected by opponents. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/10/douglas-ross-to-resign-as-scottish-tory-leader-after-election\">Ross, who quit as Scotland’s Tory leader</a> in a row over his bid to become an MP at the last election, is known for trying to goad ministers.</p>\n    <p>In his resignation letter, Hepburn acknowledged his behaviour was inappropriate and said it was “quite out of character”. He said: “Irrespective of whether or not the ministerial code has been breached, even if there had been no complaint made, I believe I have not acted in accordance with my own personal code of practice.</p>\n    <p>“I hope it would be felt by most … that in my personal and professional undertakings I have always tried to act courteously in interacting with colleagues, either of our own party or others. There is no denying that my interaction with Douglas Ross fell well short of that standard.</p>\n    <p>“Despite whatever annoyance I felt at that particular moment, there is a manner in which that might have been conveyed, or indeed shouldn’t have been conveyed. That is not in utilising the language that I did.”</p>\n    <p>He added: “With no sense of personal pity, having served continuously in government for almost 11 years it is a source of regret that my tenure in ministerial office comes to an end in this fashion.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Ross said Hepburn had contacted him after his resignation to apologise in person about his conduct. Quitting was the “correct decision”, Ross said, adding that Swinney should have acted sooner by sacking Hepburn immediately after he heard about the incident. <br/>\n “Jamie Hepburn admitted behaviour that fell well short of that expected of ministers,” Ross said. “Instead, John Swinney backed him and the nationalists were determined to ride this out and endorse that behaviour until I called for the situation to be investigated by the independent advisers on the ministerial code.”</p>\n    <p>Resignations by SNP ministers over matters of honour or principle are very rare. Several have been forced to quit, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/feb/08/scottish-health-secretary-michael-matheson-resigns-ipad-roaming-bill\">the former health secretary Michael Matheson</a> – who faced a parliamentary investigation into how he racked up a near-£11,000 bill on his work iPad – only after serious and substantiated allegations of misconduct came to light.</p>\n    <p>Swinney said he accepted Hepburn’s resignation with “much personal regret” but said he was leaving office with “my warmest thanks”. He added: “I know there will be no one more frustrated than you, over this one slip in your normal approach of courtesy and respect to all.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/19/scottish-minister-jamie-hepburn-quits-after-douglas-ross-assault-accusation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Small changes to the forecaster's outlook can make a big difference to its projections for tax income over the years ahead.</p>\n    <p>The cost to the government through its U-turns on benefit cuts - which had aimed to save billions of pounds - will also be a factor, as will the interest rates on government borrowing.</p>\n    <p>Mr Dales at Capital Economics said the chancellor would have \"to raise £28bn, mostly through higher taxes, if she wants to keep her buffer against her rule of £10bn\".</p>\n    <p>Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the latest figures suggested \"the chancellor will need to raise taxes by more than the £20bn we had previously estimated\".</p>\n    <p>\"We still expect the chancellor to fill the fiscal hole with a smorgasbord of stealth and sin tax increases, along with some smaller spending cuts.\"</p>\n    <p>On the financial markets, the value of the pound fell 0.5% against the dollar to $1.349, while government bond yields - which indicate government borrowing costs - rose on Friday.</p>\n    <p>The latest ONS figures showed interest payments on government debt rose by £1.9bn to £8.4bn, partly due to inflation pushing up costs.</p>\n    <p>Welfare spending increased by £1.1bn to £27.3bn, largely driven by inflation-linked benefit rises and higher state pension payments.</p>\n    <p>James Murray, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the government had \"a plan to bring down borrowing because taxpayer money should be spent on the country's priorities, not on debt interest\".</p>\n    <p>\"Our focus is on economic stability, fiscal responsibility, ripping up needless red tape, tearing out waste from our public services, driving forward reforms, and putting more money in working people's pockets,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride, wrote on X: \"Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are too weak and distracted to take the action needed to reduce the deficit.</p>\n    <p>\"The chancellor has lost control of the public finances, and Labour's weakness means much needed welfare reforms have been abandoned.\"</p>\n    <h2>Warm weather boosts stores</h2>\n    <p>Separate data from the ONS showed that good weather brought a boost to the High Street in August.</p>\n    <p>Retail sales rose by 0.5% during the month, slightly higher than analysts had expected, with butchers, bakers, clothing stores and online shopping all reporting growth.</p>\n    <p>The figures come despite warnings from some retailers in recent days of cost pressures and price rises.</p>\n    <p>However, the monthly shop sales data from the ONS can be volatile.</p>\n    <p>Over the three months to August sales declined by 0.1%, the ONS said, compared with the three months to May.</p>\n    <p>\"Overall, August caps off a better-than-expected summer, particularly for non-food retailers, with sales of seasonal lines boosted by the hottest summer temperatures on record,\" said Jacqueline Windsor, head of retail at PwC.</p>\n    <p>\"However, overall sales volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels, so the high street is far from being out of the woods.\"</p>\n    <p>Alice Cowley, managing director in Accenture's retail practice, said retailers were \"facing fresh headwinds as we head into the autumn\".</p>\n    <p>She said factors such as uncertainty over possible Budget measures, and ongoing energy and labour cost pressures, would continue to put profit margins \"under greater strain\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9m4lqznro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed and are threatening a government shutdown if Republicans don't let them have a say on the measure, as some Democratic support will be needed to get a bill to the president's desk for his signature.</p>\n    <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has few votes to spare as he seeks to persuade Republicans to vote for the funding patch, something many in his conference have routinely opposed in past budget fights. But this time, GOP members see a chance to portray the Democrats as responsible for a shutdown, which would begin Oct. 1, unless Congress acts.</p>\n    <p>In a sign the vote could be close, President Donald Trump weighed in Thursday, urging House Republicans to pass the bill and put the burden on Democrats to oppose it. GOP leaders often need Trump’s help to win over holdouts on legislation.</p>\n    <p>“Every House Republican should UNIFY, and VOTE YES!” Trump said on his social media site.</p>\n    <p>Republicans can pass the bill in the House if they stay united, and the speaker expressed confidence Thursday he had the votes.</p>\n    <p>“We’re going to get this government funded,” Johnson said.</p>\n    <p>Across the Capitol, though, Senate Democrats are hoping the public will support their proposal to head off a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-health-care-tax-credits-obamacare-shutdown-f1ee636ddba7f65baa5234c55cb0c96e\">big increase</a> next year in health insurance premiums for millions of Americans who purchase coverage through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. They unveiled their own funding plan to extend the enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” enacted earlier this year. </p>\n    <p>“The American people will look at what Republicans are doing, look at what Democrats are doing, and it will be clear that public sentiment will be on our side,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who has repeatedly threatened a shutdown if health care isn't addressed.</p>\n    <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Senate will vote on the House bill Friday, if it passes, along with the dueling Democratic proposal. But neither is expected to win the 60 votes necessary for passage.</p>\n    <p>Senators could then potentially leave town until Sept. 29 — one day before the shutdown deadline. The Senate has a scheduled recess next week because of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.</p>\n    <p>Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are watching Schumer closely after his <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/shutdown-trump-musk-doge-democrats-1aa4edf64103b0cf49dd26a0487ea9e6\">last-minute decision in March</a> to vote with Republicans to keep the government open. Schumer argued then that a shutdown would be damaging and would give Trump and his White House freedom to make more government cuts. Many on the left revolted, with some advocates calling for his resignation. </p>\n    <p>The vote in the spring also caused a temporary schism with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who opposed the GOP spending bill and said he would not be “complicit” with Schumer’s vote.</p>\n    <p>The two Democratic leaders now say they are united, and Schumer says things <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/schumer-government-shutdown-budget-democrats-deadline-a0a24afe93f4a1d596fdf9093db58e3d\">have changed since March</a>. The public is more wary of Trump and Republicans, Schumer says, after the passage of Medicaid cuts. </p>\n    <p>Most Democrats appear to be backing Schumer's demand that there be negotiations on the bill — and support his threats of a shutdown, even as it is unclear how they would get out of it.</p>\n    <p>Republicans say the blame would be clearly on the other side if they can’t pass a bill — and are using Schumer's previous arguments against shutdowns against him.</p>\n    <p>“Democrats would love nothing more to put in our lap a shutdown. It’s not going to happen. If it does, it’s on them,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a member of the House Freedom Caucus, whose members have frequently opposed short-term funding bills, known as continuing resolutions.</p>\n    <p>Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said: “Senator Schumer himself said that passing a clean CR will avert a harmful and unnecessary shutdown. Now he wants to cause a harmful and unnecessary shutdown.”</p>\n    <p>___</p>\n    <p>Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/house-voting-funding-patch-parties-trade-blame-potential-125724671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For example, workers pay <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-63635185\">income tax and National Insurance</a>, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.</p>\n    <p>It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes and that sometimes happens.</p>\n    <p>But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending, or borrowing money.</p>\n    <p>Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.</p>\n    <p>So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads.</p>\n    <h2>How does the government borrow money?</h2>\n    <p>The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.</p>\n    <p>A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower - in this case, the government - to make regular interest payments.</p>\n    <p>UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.</p>\n    <p>Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.</p>\n    <p>The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.</p>\n    <h2>How much is the UK government borrowing?</h2>\n    <p>The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.</p>\n    <p>For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.</p>\n    <p>So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.</p>\n    <p>In the last full financial year, to March 2025, the government borrowed £146.3bn.</p>\n    <p>The most recent figures show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly9m4lqznro\">borrowing was £18bn in August</a>, up £3.5bn from the same month last year.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5af/live/571c5f30-9543-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A Bar chart titled 'Government borrowing in August', showing the UK's public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, from August 2020 to 2025. In August 2020, public sector net borrowing stood at £24 billion. It then fell to £13.9 billion in August 2021, and again to £7.8 billion in August 2022, before rising to £11.4 billion in August 2023, £14.4 billion in August 2024, and £18 billion in August 2025. The source is the Office for National Statistics\"/>\n    <p>The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about £2.9 trillion.</p>\n    <p>That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.</p>\n    <p>The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008.</p>\n    <p>The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up.</p>\n    <p>But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies.</p>\n    <h2>How much money does the government pay in interest?</h2>\n    <p>The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.</p>\n    <p>That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.</p>\n    <p>The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.</p>\n    <p>In August 2025, interest payments on government debt were £8.4bn, which was £1.9bn more than in a year earlier.</p>\n    <h2>Why does it matter if governments borrow more and pay more interest?</h2>\n    <p>If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts and interest, it may mean it has less to spend on public services.</p>\n    <p>Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run.</p>\n    <p>The increase in projected long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government was on course to miss its own borrowing targets.</p>\n    <p>Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time.</p>\n    <p>In the October 2024 Budget, Chancellor <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg745ggn3no\">Rachel Reeves changed the definition of debt that the government would use</a> in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment.</p>\n    <p>It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\", and that \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\".</p>\n    <h2>What is the difference between debt and deficit?</h2>\n    <p>Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years.</p>\n    <p>The deficit is the gap between the government's income and the amount it spends.</p>\n    <p>When a government spends less than its income, it has what is known as a surplus.</p>\n    <p>Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2rky498wo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That puts sterling on track for its third daily fall in a row, as it drops back from Tuesday’s two-month high.</p>\n<p>Government bonds are under pressure too, as traders react to the news that borrowing is £11bn higher than forecast so far this year.</p>\n<p>The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK gilts (bonds) is up 4 basis points at 4.7% (up from 4.66% last night).</p>\n<p>30-year gilt yields have also risen by 4bps, to 5.54%.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says today’s public finance data puts the sustainability of borrowing and the size of UK state into question:</p>\n<p>The pound has sunk on this data, and is testing support at $1.3500, it is the second worst performing currency in the G10 FX space today, and is lower by 0.33% vs. the USD. The UK’s bond market is extremely fragile, 10-year and 30-year yields rose sharply on Thursday, although global long end yields were higher, the UK was the weakest performer across Europe and the US.</p>\n<p>UK bond yields could rise further on this news, especially as the Bank of England is maintaining its ‘careful and gradual’ approach to loosening monetary policy. Although the BOE has reduced the amount of bonds that it is offloading from its balance sheet, especially long end bonds, they are still shrinking their balance sheet albeit at a slower pace. Thus, the BOE cannot be relied on to relieve pressure on the long end of the Uk Gilt curve.</p>\n<p>UK government borrowing rose to a five-year high in August, official figures show, fuelling growing expectations for Rachel Reeves to raise taxes at the autumn budget and knocking the pound.</p>\n<p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – rose to £18bn in August, £3.5bn more than in the same month a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Dealing a blow for the chancellor as she prepares for the 26 November budget, the reading was above City predictions for a deficit of £12.75bn and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of £12.5bn.</p>\n<p>On top of upward revisions to previous months, total borrowing for the financial year to date jumped to £83.8bn, also the highest level since the height of the Covid pandemic in 2020. The total was £16bn higher than in 2024 and above a £72.4bn forecast from the OBR.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump has declared that his call with Xi Jinping was “very productive”, and revealed that the two leaders have agreed to visit each other’s countries.</p>\n<p>Posting on Truth Social, Trump says:</p>\n<p>I just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal. I also agreed with President Xi that we would meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea, that I would go to China in the early part of next year, and that President Xi would, likewise, come to the United States at an appropriate time. The call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!</p>\n<p>We’ve not yet, though, heard confirmation from Beijing that the TikTok deal has been finalised…</p>\n<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping said the US should avoid restrictive trade measures during his call today with US President Donald Trump, according to Xinhua News Agency.</p>\n<p>That’s a sign that Beijing is looking to ease tensions between the world’s biggest economies.</p>\n<p>However, there’s no immediate sign that the long-awaited TikTok deal has been agreed….</p>\n<p>Bloomberg has more details:</p>\n<p>Xi also told Trump that the Chinese government respects the wishes of businesses as they look to finalize an agreement on the sale of the US operations of ByteDance Ltd.’s social video app TikTok and would like to see those companies find a resolution to the issue, according to the readout from Xinhua.</p>\n<p>The official Chinese news agency characterized the talks as positive and pragmatic and said Xi had expressed confidence that Washington and Beijing could handle issues that arise between the countries, while also suggesting that the US offer a fair environment for Chinese companies to do business.</p>\n<p>The week is ending on a low note for advertising giant WPP.</p>\n<p>WPP’s shares are down around 4% in afternoon trading, and have hit their lowest level since 2009.</p>\n<p>WPP’s shares have dropped this week during a gloomy few days for the ad industry.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales’s private garden at Kensington Palace has been commandeered by Burberry, which is building a tent the size of a minor airport for its show on Monday. The mid-century fortress by Eero Saarinen that once housed London’s American embassy, recently reopened as a luxury hotel, is dressing the ballroom for the 20th anniversary show by Roksanda on Saturday night.</p>\n    <p>But the biggest transformation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week\">London fashion week</a> is happening not on the catwalk but in the boardroom, where the British Fashion Council (BFC) is under the new leadership of Laura Weir as CEO, a former newspaper magazine editor and Vogue fashion editor.</p>\n    <p>Weir’s tactics to re-establish Britain’s status in the fashion world include convincing government ministers to embed fashion into trade deals, luring famous brands back to London from Milan and Paris, and casting a net outside London to discover the next generation of British design talent.</p>\n    <p>She describes the task as “herculean”. Brexit has hammered competitiveness, Covid has destroyed supply chains, the cost of living has shrunk demand, and the rise of Milan and Paris as luxury superpowers has sucked the lifeblood from the catwalks of London and New York. What’s more, “people in government have said to me straight out: your sector is not going to get more money, because there is no money”, Weir says.</p>\n    <p>London fashion week was debated in parliament for the first time this week. Rosie Wrighting, the MP for Kettering and an ex-fashion buyer, said the “belief that creativity can be a path forward is something that London fashion week represents to me and to thousands of young people across the country who see an opportunity to be a part of something bigger than themselves”.</p>\n    <p>In the face of slashed arts education funding and a rising cost of living in major cities, Wrighting said: “We must ensure that fashion remains a viable career for young people, particularly those who are outside of London and in working-class communities.”</p>\n    <p>Givenchy’s Sarah Burton was born in Macclesfield; Burberry’s Daniel Lee in Bradford. But the creative pipeline that feeds in talent from all over the country is drying up through lack of educational opportunity. The BFC has begun a pilot programme taking designers back to their schools to meet and inspire younger generations.</p>\n    <p>More substantially, they hope to lean on Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis, “who are now not just stockists but strategic partners”, says Weir, to amplify their message.</p>\n    <p>Peter Ruis, the managing director of John Lewis, agrees that his store is “a key part of the ecosystem, with our distribution and buying power, especially as we get bolder with fashion”. John Lewis has teamed up with the award-winning designer Rejina Pyo for a limited edition collection dropping next month, and has been a crucial patron and stockist to the Harry Styles favourite Steven Stokey-Daley.</p>\n    <p>“It was really important for Steven that we stocked it in our Liverpool store, his home town. Just a real thing for his family. In fact, Liverpool has become a bit of a fashion flagship for us. They really love their fashion,” says Ruis, who will be attending several London fashion week shows this weekend.</p>\n    <p>In Milan, the fashion and luxury industry recently received a €250m (£215m) stimulus package from the Italian government. Weir says: “Carlo Capaldi [her counterpart in Milan] was on record saying, it’s nice but it’s not enough – and I just thought, wow. When I look at the support fashion gets in the UK, it really pales by comparison.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I started this job not long after we got a new government, which felt like interesting timing. The culture and creativity sectors are naturally left leaning so one would hope there would be a strong level of engagement. There is support, but what I’m wary of is fashion being used when they want sparkle. We’re more than that.”</p>\n    <p>The British fashion industry contributes £68bn to the economy, and supports more than 1m jobs. “Fashion literally makes us look better as a nation! Having said that, I do have perspective. There’s a lot going on, and fashion has to earn its headlines,” adds Weir.</p>\n    <p>Burberry aside, the hottest tickets of London fashion week – such as Dilara Findikoglu – have minimal name recognition outside the industry. Victoria Beckham, one of Britain’s most well-known designers, moved her show to Paris three years ago.</p>\n    <p>“I’m not going to guilt-trip designers that have left the UK to come back out of obligation if it doesn’t make sense for their businesses,” says Weir, who wore a Victoria Beckham suit to attend the debate in parliament. However, she namechecks McQueen, currently showing in Paris, as a target. “I think the nation would celebrate the return of that brand to the city that inspired it. It could make strategic sense.</p>\n    <p>“What I hear everywhere I go is that people in this country are really proud of British fashion,” says Weir. “I’m heartened by that.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/19/london-fashion-week-aims-to-restore-sectors-role-as-uk-economic-powerhouse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Trump has since given TikTok three more extensions as his administration tried to broker a deal for ByteDance to divest and U.S. companies to take control — a series of reprieves that legal experts</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>liability shield</u>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/19/nx-s1-5267568/tiktok-back-online\">.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>have questioned</u>\n    <p>The fate of TikTok became increasingly wrapped up in<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/g-s1-72042/us-china-trade-framework-london-talks\">  sweeping trade talks</a> between Washington and Beijing that include strategically thorny topics like </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5460936/trump-tariffs-economy-china-policy\">,</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>tariffs</u>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5542032/the-ongoing-u-s-china-trade-war-has-complicated-things-for-u-s-chip-giant-nvidia\">,</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>microchips</u>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5475137/china-rare-earth-elements\">and China's export of chemicals used to make the synthetic opioid fentanyl.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>rare earth minerals</u>\n    <p>The U.S. and China found themselves in a tariff spiral earlier this year after President Trump's announcement of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5345802/trump-tariffs-liberation-day\"> \"Liberation Day\" tariffs</a>. The two sides announced several rounds of tit-for-tat retaliatory levies until U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports hit 145%, and Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports topped out at 125%</p>\n    <p><strong>,</strong>threatening to bring all trade to a halt.</p>\n    <p>At a meeting in Geneva in May, the two sides<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/12/nx-s1-5395027/us-china-tariffs-deal-trade-war-beijing-washington\">  announced a 90-day truce</a>, lowered tariff rates and eased other trade barriers including deliveries of Chinese rare earth minerals.</p>\n    <p>In August, Trump issued an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/08/further-modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-ongoing-discussions-with-the-peoples-republic-of-china/\"> executive order</a> to keep tariffs low while trade negotiations continue. At present, the standard U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods is 30%, while China's rate on American goods stands at 10%.</p>\n    <p>There's more at stake than just trade, however.</p>\n    <p>Hong Kong's <i>South China Morning Post</i> <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3325739/trumps-china-trip-many-hinge-boeing-and-soybean-deals-sources-say?module=inline&amp;pgtype=article\"> reported</a> last week that China and the U.S. were in the \"final stage\" of negotiations for Trump to make a state visit to China, after Beijing sent a formal state invitation early this month.</p>\n    <p>The leaders of the world's top two economies <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5421316/trump-xi-tariffs-phone-call\"> spoke in June</a> and agreed on an in-person meeting. If Trump travels to China, it will be the first visit to the country by a U.S. president since 2017, when he went in his first term.</p>\n    <p>For Xi, analysts say, a visit would be a symbolic win, demonstrating U.S. respect and underscoring his peer status with Trump. It would also likely help stabilize the bilateral relationship while improving trade relations and rhetoric, something Beijing has been keen to secure as it grapples with a sluggish economy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545600/tiktok-deal-talks-trump-xi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That was compounded in 2022 by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which raised food prices around the world. Avian flu added to the more recent spike in egg prices.

A <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/July-W1-Topline_BNPL.pdf\">survey this summer by The Associated Press and NORC</a> found the cost of groceries has become a major source of stress for just over half of all Americans — outpacing rent, health care and student debt. </p>\n    <h3>What are people doing about it?</h3>\n    <p>Rebecca White, who works at a bank in Cincinnati, says her paycheck has not kept pace with her rising grocery bills. She's scouring the back of her cupboards for food and eating a lot of spaghetti.</p>\n    <p>\"I try to stick to cheaper meals, which isn't always healthy,\" White says. \"Sometimes I'll skip breakfast and then just have lunch and dinner so that I don't have to buy another meal.\"</p>\n    <p>The giant Kroger supermarket chain says the stress is apparent as shoppers make smaller, more frequent trips to the store, use more coupons, and opt for cheaper private-label products.</p>\n    <p>White says she's not optimistic about finding relief at the checkout line any time soon.</p>\n    <p>\"Once prices go up, they rarely if ever come back down,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>The double-digit price hikes triggered by the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine came as a shock after decades of relatively stable grocery prices. And shoppers are reminded of those higher prices week after week.</p>\n    <p>\"We all have to eat. And food is very personal,\" says David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University. \"Grocery prices have become a hot-button political flash point over the past couple of years.\"</p>\n    <p>President Trump has said repeatedly that shoppers' frustration with grocery prices helped put him back in the White House.</p>\n    <p>\"Groceries went through the roof. And I campaigned on that,\" Trump told a White House audience in April.</p>\n    <p>Despite Trump's promise to lower prices, the overall cost of groceries is higher now than when he was sworn in. The president's crackdown on illegal immigration — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5431612/trump-ice-farm-raids-united-farm-workers-union\">including targeting people who pick and process our food</a> — could add to upward pressure on prices. Trump's tariffs are also contributing to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/21/nx-s1-5470131/us-coffee-prices-brazil-trump-tariffs\">higher prices for imported staples</a> like bananas and coffee.</p>\n    <p>\"Tariffs are simply a tax on imported goods,\" Ortega says. \"So that raises the cost, and ultimately consumers see that at the grocery store.\"</p>\n    <p>Coffee prices have jumped more than 20% in the last year.  And while some of that is due to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5228008/coffee-prices-brazil-drought-weather\">weather in coffee-growing countries</a> like Brazil and Vietnam, Trump's double-digit import taxes are not helping.  </p>\n    <p>Shelia Fields stocked up on coffee when the tariffs were announced in midsummer. She's not sure what she'll do when that supply runs out.</p>\n    <p>\"We have not bought coffee in a month and the prices are going up, up, up,\" she says with a rueful laugh. \"We're down to like one cup in the morning. And I just hate to give that up.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5539547/grocery-prices-tariffs-food-inflation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The total was £16bn higher than in 2024 and above a £72.4bn forecast from the OBR.</p>\n    <p>The pound fell against the dollar after the figures were released on Friday morning, slipping by half a cent to trade at about $1.35, while UK government borrowing costs rose on the financial markets.</p>\n    <p>The OBR said the overshoot in the August data was mainly driven by upward revisions to estimates of local authority borrowing. In addition, VAT and other receipts were lower than expected last month.</p>\n    <p>The independent Treasury watchdog said it expected a lower level of borrowing in the second half of the financial year, amid predictions for a rise in capital gains tax receipts and lower levels of debt interest.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/sm1pb/2/\">UK borrowing graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>However, economists warned that a weak economic outlook, elevated borrowing costs and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">expected downgrade in the OBR’s productivity forecasts</a> would force Reeves to raise taxes or cut spending if she wanted to keep within her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/23/should-rachel-reevess-fiscal-rules-stay-golden-or-are-they-meant-to-be-broken\">fiscal rules</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Taxes will almost certainly need to rise if the fiscal rules are to be met,” said Matt Swannell, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. “A combination of gilt market stress and reversals on welfare reform has used up the thin margin for error in the government’s current spending plans.”</p>\n    <p>The consultancy Capital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> forecast the chancellor would need to raise about £28bn, mostly through higher taxes, if she wanted to maintain the £9.9bn buffer held against the fiscal rule at the spring statement.</p>\n    <p>James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government had a plan to bring down borrowing. “Our focus is on economic stability, fiscal responsibility, ripping up needless red tape, tearing out waste from our public services, driving forward reforms, and putting more money in working people’s pockets,” he added.</p>\n    <p>The latest snapshot from the ONS showed the exchequer benefited from rising national insurance receipts, reflecting the chancellor’s £25bn increase in the rate paid by employers at her first autumn budget.</p>\n    <p>However, the increase was outstripped by higher spending on public services, benefits and debt interest.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-14\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">highest level in 27 years</a>, fuelled largely by global factors but also investor worries over the strength of the UK economy and the public finances.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said central government debt interest rose to £8.4bn in August, £1.9bn higher than in the same month a year earlier.</p>\n    <p>The figures come a day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> kept interest rates unchanged at 4% and scaled back its multibillion-pound “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/18/what-is-quantitative-tightening-how-affected-uk-finances\">quantitative tightening</a>” plan to dispose of billions of pounds in UK government bonds.</p>\n    <p>The Bank disposed of £100bn last year through a mixture of sales and allowing maturing debt to expire. Economists warned this could contribute to the UK’s rising borrowing costs.</p>\n    <p>On Thursday the central bank said it would scale back its plan to £70bn for the year ahead. However, fewer bonds will mature in the next 12 months. As a result, the Bank is increasing its active sales to £21bn even though it has a lower target overall.</p>\n    <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are too weak and distracted to take the action needed to reduce the deficit. The chancellor has lost control of the public finances, and Labour’s weakness means much-needed welfare reforms have been abandoned.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/19/uk-borrowing-budget-rachel-reeves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Already £129m of the £200m has been paid to almost 150,000 customers.</p>\n    <p>Sarah Pritchard, the deputy chief executive of the FCA, said: “We’ll step in when consumers aren’t getting fair value – and we are pleased to see that the practices which led to some unfair payouts have already changed. This means thousands of motorists are getting back what their car was really worth, in cases where cars have been stolen or written off.</p>\n    <p>“If you’re owed compensation, your insurer will contact you, or will have already done so – there’s nothing you need to do.”</p>\n    <p>Cormac Bradley, the senior actuarial director at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, said it had become increasingly difficult to value cars given the pace of price fluctuations in recent years.</p>\n    <p>“There’s also a higher number of cash settlements as vehicle repairs are hampered by supply chain pressures and labour shortages. Insurers need to be confident that they reflect the uncertainty appropriately in the customer’s favour to avoid undercompensation.</p>\n    <p>“This is no small challenge at a time of volatile car prices so it is pleasing that the regulator and the motor insurance industry have reached a resolution which will enable fair, historic compensation and certainty moving forward.”</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: “Insurers work hard to deliver the best possible service for their customers. There has been a lot of volatility in the secondhand car market in recent years which created challenges for insurers when trying to set valuations. Our members have made changes to their settlement approach and taken the necessary steps to support customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/19/car-insurers-drivers-share-compensation-fca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Mary May started buying from third-party sellers on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a>'s online marketplace, she said she assumed the products she was purchasing were the same as the ones she'd long bought in stores. </p>\n<p>So in late March when she said she saw a \"ridiculous sale\" on her favorite Neuriva brain supplements on Walmart's marketplace, she bought eight bottles for her and her sister.</p>\n<p>But when some of the once-daily oral supplements arrived from a seller calling itself Lifeworks-ACS, the 59-year-old mother of three noticed there were misspellings on the bottle and the packaging looked different than it usually did. Weeks later, CNBC confirmed the supplements were counterfeit – and the seller had taken the identity of another business to sign up for the marketplace.</p>\n<p>\"Walmart betrayed me. …They let me purchase something that could have harmed me, my family,\" May, who was refunded by Walmart for the fake products, told CNBC in an interview from her home in Pleasant Shade, Tennessee. \"As a customer, I expect them to care about my well-being when I purchase something from them. Whether it's from a third-party seller or not, it's on Walmart's website.\"</p>\n<p>May and other shoppers both loyal and new have turned to <a href=\"http://walmart.com\">Walmart.com</a> for better prices and a wider selection than they often get in stores, powering<strong> </strong>a new wave of sales for the largest U.S. retailer as it races to catch up with<strong> </strong>Amazon's marketplace. Those customers helped Walmart's U.S. digital business turn profitable this spring after years of losing money, an important milestone for a company that has said e-commerce is the key to increasing its future earnings.</p>\n<p>But Walmart's digital boom came as it made it easier for third-party sellers to join and sell on its marketplace, a strategy that has come with a cost, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/walmart-marketplace-fakes-scams-investigation-takeaways.html\">a CNBC investigation</a> uncovered. </p>\n<p>Shoppers going to Walmart.com for deals on top brands are sometimes receiving <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/avoid-buying-fake-products-online-marketplaces.html\">counterfeit</a>, potentially dangerous products instead, CNBC found. Third-party sellers on Walmart's platform in certain cases aren't who they say they are, as CNBC found at least 43 vendors who used the identity of another business to set up their account. Over time, Walmart made its seller and product vetting more lax than Amazon's policies in a bid to woo sellers away from its rival, according to nine marketplace sellers and four current and former Walmart employees. </p>\n<p>\"It's very disturbing,\" said Elaine Damo, the owner of Lifeworks-ACS, which provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities.</p>\n<p>\"It's a domino effect, and it trickles and affects everyone,\" said Damo, who told CNBC she was sent returns from more than a dozen customers — including May — who had purchased counterfeits from the third-party seller that was impersonating her business.</p>\n<p>Reckitt, the maker of Neuriva, said it \"immediately opened an investigation\" after learning about the counterfeit supplements May bought and said \"the health and safety of consumers is our top priority.\" It said anyone who believes they may have bought a fake item should stop using it and contact the company's customer care team.</p>\n<p>Over the last five years, the number of sellers and items for sale on Walmart's marketplace has exploded. The platform's U.S. revenue grew 45% and 37%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, Walmart has said. That expansion has fueled Walmart's U.S. e-commerce business, which is second only to Amazon in online sales dollars, according to research from financial firm Mizuho. It's nearing $100 billion in annual revenue and is on pace to represent 10% of all domestic online sales by 2026, Mizuho said.</p>\n<p>But that meteoric rise came partly from Walmart's decision to accept some risks in the interest of growth, current and former employees said.</p>\n<p>Tammie Jones, who worked on Walmart's seller vetting team from September 2023 to April 2024, said she was pressured to approve seller applications, even when she had concerns about the applicant's credentials or documentation.</p>\n<p>\"It got to a point where they were just like, 'You know what? Just go ahead and approve everybody,'\" Jones said of her managers' directives. \"They wanted that business, so they were willing to take a chance on it.\"</p>\n<p>In a statement, Walmart said \"trust and safety are non-negotiable for us.\"<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>\"We're unwavering in our commitment to delivering everyday low prices, a broad assortment, and innovative shopping experiences. Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior,\" Walmart said. \"We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers.\"</p>\n<p>Counterfeits and fraud <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/shop-safe-act-2020-cracks-down-on-counterfeits-on-ecommerce-platforms.html\">are endemic</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/25/amazon-turns-to-team-of-ex-prosecutors-to-try-to-fight-counterfeiters.html\">third-party marketplaces</a>. Amazon, among others, had trouble policing counterfeits as they grew. But Amazon has since tightened its vetting, according to interviews with sellers and e-commerce consultants. Meanwhile, it became easier for bad actors to join and sell on Walmart's marketplace, CNBC's investigation found. </p>\n<p>Walmart has required less documentation and vetting to sign up for its marketplace and had imposed fewer restrictions on the types of products people could sell than its main e-commerce rival, according to a review of Walmart's and Amazon's seller applications and interviews with sellers, former employees and e-commerce consultants.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/walmart-marketplace-fakes-scams-investigation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As more consumers prioritize convenience and value over brand loyalty, experts say they're turning to online marketplaces more than ever to buy the things they need, raising the risk they could inadvertently purchase a fake product.</p>\n<p>While fake goods have exchanged hands in informal markets since ancient times, the growth of online marketplaces has contributed to the rise in counterfeits because of how easy online shopping and selling have become. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/walmart-marketplace-fakes-scams-investigation.html\">A CNBC investigation</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a>'s marketplace published Friday uncovered dozens of third-party sellers who had stolen the identity of another business, and some of them were offering fake health and beauty products.</p>\n<p>After CNBC shared <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/walmart-marketplace-fakes-scams-investigation-takeaways.html\">its reporting</a> with Walmart, the company began tightening its vetting process for some products and sellers and said it has a \"zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products.\"</p>\n<p>Between 2020 and 2024, e-commerce as a percentage of overall U.S. retail sales <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA\">reached record highs</a>, and goods seized for intellectual property violations more than doubled during that general time period, according to <a href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/intellectualpropertyrightsseizurestatisticsfiscalyear2024_pbrb_approved_with_publication_number_508.pdf\">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>.</p>\n<p>When shopping on online marketplaces, consumers need to be \"very careful\" to avoid inadvertently purchasing fakes, said Megan Carpenter, the dean and professor of intellectual property law at the University of New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce School of Law.</p>\n<p>\"You're purchasing from sellers, distributors, manufacturers that are all over the world with the push of a button,\" said Carpenter, who previously practiced intellectual property law. \"Sometimes you hear the phrase, 'buy cheap, buy twice,' but there are also big safety and danger issues\" that come from purchasing fakes online, she said.</p>\n<p>Counterfeit products have been endemic to third-party marketplaces for as long as they have existed, but it is difficult to quantify just how common they are. While longtime marketplace operators have made numerous policy changes over the years to crack down on fakes, the nature of the platforms makes it difficult to eradicate counterfeits altogether. Amazon said it has taken steps to address fakes on its platform, and is \"proud of the progress\" it has made in preventing counterfeits. Walmart added in its statement to CNBC that customers who are not satisfied with an item can return it for a full refund.</p>\n<p>To ensure consumers are getting the real thing, here are a few guidelines experts said people should follow when shopping on online marketplaces.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Research the seller </h2>\n<p>Plenty of brands sell their products directly to consumers through online marketplaces. If the company that makes the item is the one that's also selling it, experts said that's always a consumer's best bet when shopping on online platforms.</p>\n<p>If the seller offering the item is not the brand, consumers should research the business to make sure it is legitimate.</p>\n<p>In the past, the name or business information of a third-party seller offering a product wasn't always clear. But the Inform Consumers Act, a law that took effect in 2023, now <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/the-inform-act-takes-effect-targeting-organized-retail-theft.html\">requires platforms</a> to publish that information for certain sellers. </p>\n<p>When shopping on marketplaces like Walmart and Amazon, consumers can see the name of the seller offering the product on the right-hand side of the page. When they click the business name, they can typically see more information, such as its address, phone number and some information about what it does.</p>\n<p>The seller's page will offer a host of clues to consumers. Shoppers can typically see where the business is based, go over its catalog of items and read the reviews it has received. If other shoppers have left reviews saying the business sold fake products, that's a good sign that consumers should find another seller or other place to purchase the goods.</p>\n<p>Shoppers should also check the address of the business. For example, if the seller is offering beauty products and the address either doesn't exist or goes back to a car repair shop, that's a red flag.</p>\n<p>The name of the business matters, too, said Kari Kammel, the director of the Center for Anti-Counterfeiting and Product Protection at Michigan State University.</p>\n<p>\"For example, if you're buying toys online, and the seller is called, you know, cheap kitchen utensils shop, there's a discrepancy there, right?\" she said. \"So it can be a red flag.\"</p>\n<p>If it's not immediately obvious if the brand is selling the item, a quick Google search will typically reveal whether the marketplace seller is an authorized distributor of the product. Many brands publish information about resellers on their websites.</p>\n<p>When shopping for health and beauty items, the kinds of products that go in or on someone's body, consumers should only buy directly from the brand or one of its authorized distributors to make sure they are getting genuine products, experts said.</p>\n<p>\"With any of these counterfeits, you're gambling, right? You may get one that doesn't cause any harm, but maybe it just won't last as long, if you're lucky,\" said Kammel. \"On the flip side, you may get something that just totally fails in what would be a normal quality or safety inspection from a legitimate company, and can cause serious harm.\"</p>\n<p>Plenty of the stuff sold on online marketplaces is considered first party, meaning the platform owns and distributes the products themselves on a wholesale basis. If consumers see \"sold and shipped by Amazon\" or \"sold and shipped by Walmart\" they can feel comfortable purchasing the item, regardless of the category, experts said.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Question the price </h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/avoid-buying-fake-products-online-marketplaces.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Melissa Jefferson-Wooden claims double gold!</p>\n    <p>Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has successfully clinched her second world title at the 2025 World Athletics Championships. Jefferson-Wooden stormed through the tracks to win the <a href=\"https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-championships/tokyo25/news/report/world-championships-tokyo-25-report-womens-200m\">200-meter finals with the fastest time of the season, 21.68.</a> The 24-year-old is now the fourth woman and the first American to complete the sprint double, winning both the 100-meter and 200-meter world titles.</p>\n    <p>\"I came out here and I did exactly what I set out to do. Not a lot of women double anymore, so for me to come here, do the double and win gold medals just says a lot,\" a proud Jefferson-Wooden said in the post-race interview.</p>\n    <p>Trailing behind Jefferson-Wooden, Great Britain’s Amy Hunt claimed her first individual world title in 22.14. It was Great Britain’s second podium of these championships. Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson, who was not able to defend her title for the second time, claimed bronze in 22.18. Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith placed fifth.</p>\n    <p>Notably, the lineup was absent of 100-meter Olympic champion Julien Alfred, who pulled out of the event after suffering a hamstring injury last week. Nonetheless, to be able to catch Jefferson-Wooden, Smith would have needed to upgrade her personal time of 21.71.</p>\n    <p>The race was restarted after Bahamas’ Anthonique Strachan faced a disqualification due to an early start. On the second turn, Jefferson-Wooden blasted through the blocks and claimed a lead halfway through the race to win America’s first 200-meter world title since Allyson Felix in 2009.</p>\n    <h2>Melissa Jefferson-Wooden’s Stellar Season</h2>\n    <p>Since placing third at the 2024 Paris Olympic 100-meter final, Jefferson-Wooden has come a long way. She has remained undefeated in the 100-meter category throughout the season. Last Sunday, she claimed her first individual world title in the category <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/parasjan/2025/09/14/world-athletics-2025-melissa-jefferson-wooden-wins-100-meter-finals-with-record-time/\">with a new championship record in 10.61. </a></p>\n    <p>Although her favoured event remains the 100-meter category, the sprinter has also showcased strong outings in the 200-meter category. She won the 200-meter dash at every Grand Slam track meet, and then at the U.S. trials, she surpassed reigning Olympic champion Gabby Thomas with a personal best time of 21.84 seconds. Now, following today’s performance, she is the first woman to achieve the double gold at Worlds since Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce in 2013.</p>\n    <p>After capping off her season as the fastest woman in both the 100-meter and 200-meter categories in 2025, with 20 wins from 22 races, Melissa Jefferson-Wooden is eyeing a new goal: a double gold on home soil in 2028. \"I'm now looking forward to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics. I definitely put a target on my back.\"</p>\n    <p/>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/parasjan/2025/09/19/melissa-jefferson-wooded-wins-200-meter-final-to-complete-sprint-double/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But over time, Walmart loosened those controls in a bid to woo sellers away from Amazon and appear more friendly than its rival, according to sellers, e-commerce consultants, and current and former employees.</p>\n<p>When asked for comment on CNBC's reporting, Walmart said \"trust and safety are non-negotiable for us.\"<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>\"Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior,\" Walmart said. \"We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers.\"</p>\n<p>CNBC's investigation uncovered new details about Walmart's strategy to grow its online marketplace and the risks it took to take market share from Amazon.</p>\n<p>Here are five takeaways from the investigation.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Stolen identities and product tests </h2>\n<p>During CNBC's investigation into Walmart's marketplace, it found at least 43 third-party sellers who had used the identity of another business to set up their account. Some of these sellers were impersonating large, publicly traded companies such as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TMO/\">Thermo Fisher Scientific</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RMTI/\">Rockwell Medical</a>, while others were smaller, private businesses, such as a New York grocery chain and a Chicago pizzeria. </p>\n<p>CNBC purchased and tested six items for its investigation, all of them highly rated, deeply discounted beauty products offered by sellers that were impersonating legitimate businesses. All of them were fake, according to brands and lab testing.</p>\n<p>Some of the companies that were being impersonated on <a href=\"http://walmart.com\">Walmart.com</a> told CNBC they had received mysterious packages at their homes or businesses that they later realized were customer returns. </p>\n<p>One of them, Lifeworks-ACS, received at least 14 returns and mailed them to CNBC for authentication. All of them were found to be counterfeit.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Employee pressure </h2>\n<p>During the Covid pandemic, Walmart's marketplace boomed and the company gradually made it easier for sellers to join and list items on the platform, former employees said.</p>\n<p>One of those former employees, Tammie Jones, said when she first joined Walmart's seller vetting team, the requirements to join the marketplace were strict. But she said over time, there was pressure from management to approve more sellers, even when she had concerns about the applicant's credentials or documentation.</p>\n<p>\"It got to a point where they were just like, 'You know what? Just go ahead and approve everybody,'\" said Jones. \"They wanted that business, so they were willing to take a chance on it.\"</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Onboarding and product vetting </h2>\n<p>The requirements to join Amazon's and Walmart's marketplaces are different. Amazon often makes sellers conduct a video interview with a company employee, while Walmart's marketplace <a href=\"https://marketplace.walmart.com/about-walmart-marketplace/#s1-1\">does not list a video interview</a> as a requirement to join.</p>\n<p>Over time, Walmart also made changes to the documentation it requires sellers to submit during the application process. In the past, applicants were required to provide their employer identification number and both a W-9 and EIN form, according to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpGZzRjRdoE\">video</a> of Walmart's application uploaded in February 2022.</p>\n<p>As recently as late March, applicants still needed to provide their EIN, but they were no longer required to upload their W-9 and EIN form, according to a video of <a href=\"https://seller.walmart.com/signup?locale=en-US\">Walmart's seller application</a> posted to YouTube on March 31. </p>\n<p>At the time, the only document U.S. sellers were required to upload was a copy of their driver's license or passport, according to the video. Additional IRS documentation was listed as \"optional,\" the video shows.</p>\n<p>There are also differences in the documentation Amazon and Walmart require from sellers about the products they want to list. On Amazon, some sellers are asked to provide invoices showing how they sourced their products, which includes proof they purchased between 10 and sometimes as many as 100 units. The Walmart sellers CNBC spoke to, who were interviewed before Walmart changed some aspects of its vetting process in July, said they were rarely, if ever, asked to provide details on how they sourced their goods. Those who were asked to submit documents said they often only needed to show an invoice for one unit and occasionally, answer a few questions about their supplier.</p>\n<p>Providing an invoice that only shows one unit, compared with 10 or 100, makes it easier for people to resell stolen or counterfeit goods, experts said.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"\"/>Walmart's changes</h2>\n<p>About three weeks after CNBC shared its reporting with Walmart, the company changed some of its marketplace vetting policies for beauty and personal-care products in late July.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/walmart-marketplace-fakes-scams-investigation-takeaways.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/covid-shot-access-coverage-at-stake-as-rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-meets-.html\">vaccine panel</a> on Friday postponed a vote on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B shot from birth to at least one month for most babies born in the U.S.</p>\n<p>The decision means that the committee's <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html\">current recommendation</a> – that all infants receive a hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth – will stay in place until the group meets again at a later date. It's unclear when the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will convene again to discuss the hepatitis B shot.</p>\n<p>ACIP was considering whether to delay the first dose of the vaccine until at least one month of age for babies of women who test negative for hepatitis B. That would change a safe and highly effective birth dose recommendation that was introduced in 1991 and is credited with virtually eliminating the disease in young kids.</p>\n<p>Some advisors defended the birth dose recommendation during the meeting, saying that delaying it could introduce potential risks to babies, including more infections. But others, particularly those who are known vaccine critics, cast doubt on the safety of administering the vaccine to babies so soon.</p>\n<p>Dr. Robert Malone, who gained notoriety for promoting Covid misinformation, brought the motion to postpone the vote.</p>\n<p>\"I believe that there's enough ambiguity here and enough remaining discussion about safety, effectiveness and timing that I believe that a vote today would be premature,\" Malone said.</p>\n<p>All 12 members supported the motion. Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said, \"I don't think there's any question whatsoever that the benefit [of the birth dose] far outweighs any adverse side effects.\"</p>\n<p>The postponed vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one-to-two months after birth, with a third dose between six and 18 months of age.</p>\n<p>Also on Friday, the group voted to recommend hepatitis B testing for all pregnant women. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose most recent director was ousted by the Trump administration, has to sign off on the committee's new and future recommendations.</p>\n<p>The panel's<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ\"> closely watched two-day meeting</a> in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-malone-cdc-vaccine-committee.html\">appointed</a> 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost, raising concerns among health experts that Kennedy's reshaped panel could curb access to safe and effective immunizations.</p>\n<p>The hepatitis B shot has been a life-saving public health intervention against the disease, which can lead to severe health problems, including liver cancer and failure, and death. Acute hepatitis B infections reported among children and teens dropped by 99% between 1990 and 2019, some <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548\">studies </a>said. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that the so-called birth dose is critical to reduce chronic hepatitis B later in life. </p>\n<p>On Thursday, advisors and other scientific experts clashed over the safety of the birth dose.</p>\n<p>\"I believe that this vaccine is absolutely critical for babies that are treated,\" said member Retsef Levi, who has been vocal about his opposition to RNA vaccines. \"But this notion that we sit here with very lousy evidence and argue there is no problem whatsoever [with administering the shot at birth] is not building trust, and it's not scientific and it's not what the public here should expect from us.\"</p>\n<p>But Meissner said that changing the recommendation will \"increase the risk of harm based on no evidence of benefit.\" He said there will be fewer children who get the full hepatitis B vaccine series, adding that administering the shot at birth in the hospital ensures that babies at least receive their first dose.</p>\n<p>\"As people have asked, why would we pick one month? Why two? There's no evidence that it's safer at a later time,\" Meissner said. \"It's an extremely safe vaccine, a very pure vaccine. So I think we will be creating new doubts in the minds of the public that are not justified.\"</p>\n<p>Ahead of the vote, the American Medical Association strongly urged the panel to keep the birth dose recommendation in place. Other experts outside of the panel also expressed concern about changing the guidance.</p>\n<p>\"I have not seen any data that says that there is benefit to the infant of waiting a month but there are a number of potential harms to the incident of waiting a month,\" said Dr. Adam Langer, a CDC epidemiologist <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/final-posted-2025-09-17-508.pdf\">who gave a presentation </a>on the hepatitis B birth dose, ahead of the vote.</p>\n<p>During his presentation, Langer said, \"the sooner that the hepatitis B vaccine is provided after birth, the greater its effectiveness in preventing perinatal transmission.\" That refers to when an infant becomes infected from its mother during birth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK/\">Merck</a>, which manufactures one of the vaccines used starting at birth, pushed back on the proposed recommendation ahead of the panel's official vote on Thursday. </p>\n<p>\"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said during the meeting.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

are supporting gains in the dollar.  The dollar is also climbing today on weakness in the British pound, which fell to a 2-week low after the UK's Aug government borrowing exceeded estimates.  The dollar fell back from its best level today after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he has penciled in two additional Fed rate cuts this year.</p>\n<p>The dollar is being undercut by concerns over Fed independence, which could prompt foreign investors to dump dollar assets as President Trump attempts to fire Fed Governor Cook, and by Stephen Miran's intention to be a Fed Governor while still technically holding his White House job on the Council of Economic Advisors. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he supported the FOMC's decision to cut interest rates by 25 bp this week, and he has penciled in two additional cuts this year.</p>\n<p>The markets are now pricing in a 91% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29.</p>\n<p>EUR/USD (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/forex/quotes/%5EEURUSD/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">^EURUSD</a>) today is down by -0.25%.  Deflation concerns in the Eurozone are dovish for ECB policy and negative for the euro after German Aug producer prices posted their biggest year-on-year decline in 15 months.  The euro is also under pressure today from a stronger dollar.  In addition, fiscal concerns are undercutting the euro after the German government said Thursday that it will borrow about 20% more than originally planned in Q4 to help fund a surge in spending on infrastructure and the armed forces. </p>\n<p>German Aug PPI fell -0.5% m/m and -2.2% y/y, weaker than expectations of -0.1% m/m and -1.7% y/y, with the -2.2% y/y drop the biggest year-on-year decline in 15 months.</p>\n<p>ECB comments today are mixed for the euro.  On the negative side, ECB Governing Council member Centeno said, \"Growth in the Eurozone is below potential and inflation will soon fall below our target and stay there for some time.  I believe that it's more likely than not that we have to ease monetary policy further.\" Conversely, ECB Governing Council member Muller said the ECB is running a slightly accommodating monetary policy and currently has no reason to lower borrowing costs any further.</p>\n<p>Losses in the euro are contained due to central bank divergence, as the markets view the ECB as largely finished with its rate-cut cycle, while the Fed is expected to cut rates by roughly two more times by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>Swaps are pricing in a 2% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the October 30 policy meeting.</p>\n<p>USD/JPY (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/forex/quotes/%5EUSDJPY/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">^USDJPY</a>) today is down by -0.08%.  The yen recovered from overnight losses and is slightly higher on signs that the BOJ is tightening monetary policy when it said it will begin selling off its ETF holdings. </p>\n<p>The yen initially moved lower today after Japan's Aug national CPI rose less than expected, a dovish factor for BOJ policy.  The yen is also under pressure after the BOJ kept interest rates steady at today's policy meeting and after BOJ Governor Ueda said the BOJ needs to see more data before adjusting monetary policy.  Higher T-note yields today are also bearish for the yen.</p>\n<p>The yen also has some carryover support from Tuesday, when Japanese Minister of Agriculture Koizumi said he would run in the party leadership race of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Koizumi is seen as hawkish on fiscal policy and less likely to try to influence the BOJ's interest rate path.</p>\n<p>Japan's Aug national CPI rose +2.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.8% y/y and the slowest pace of increase in 10 months.  Aug national CPI ex-fresh food and energy eased to +3.3% y/y from +3.4% y/y in Jul, right on expectations.</p>\n<p>As expected, the BOJ voted 7-2 to keep the overnight call rate unchanged at 0.50% and said it plans to sell 330 billion yen of its ETF holdings per year.</p>\n<p>BOJ Governor Ueda said the BOJ needs to see more data to assess the impact of US tariffs and will factor into its price and economic outlook any stimulus policies that the country's next prime minister decides. </p>\n<p>December gold (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/GC*0/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">GCZ2</a>5) today is up +15.40 (+0.42%), and December silver (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/SI*0/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">SIZ2</a>5) is up +0.492 (+1.17%).  Precious metal prices are moving higher today as dovish central bank comments boost demand for precious metals as a store of value.  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he has penciled in two additional cuts this year.  Also, ECB Governing Council member Centeno said he believes more likely than not that the ECB will have to ease monetary policy further.</p>\n<p>Gains in precious metals are limited today due to a stronger dollar.  Also, higher global government bond yields today are undercutting precious metals prices.  In addition, strength in stocks today has curbed safe-haven demand for precious metals.  Finally, hawkish comments today from ECB Governing Council member Muller weighed on gold prices when he said the ECB has no reason to lower borrowing costs any further. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a

When they do, the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens store the <i>M. structor </i>male’s sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the <i>M. ibericus</i> queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs’ nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be <i>M. structor </i>male clones.</p>\n<p>The queens produce males of both <i>M. ibericus </i>and <i>M. structor</i>, and all the worker ants in <i>M. ibericus </i>colonies<i> </i>are female hybrids of the two species.</p>\n<p>“It’s an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says <a href=\"https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/186303\">Jacobus Boomsma</a>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02807-0#ref-CR1\"> Nature</a>’s Max Kozlov.</p>\n<p>Even more perplexing is the fact that <i>M. ibericus </i>and<i> M. structor</i> are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think <a href=\"https://humanorigins.si.edu/education/frequently-asked-questions\">humans and chimpanzees</a> split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.</p>\n<p>Proving the relationship between <i>M. ibericus</i> and <i>M. structor</i> was challenging. The scientists dug up various <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/ant-queen-lays-eggs-hatch-two-species\"> Science</a>’s Erik Stokstad.</p>\n<p>In the end, they found 132 males from 26 <i>M. ibericus</i> colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless—a hallmark of <i>M. structor</i>—while the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in <i>M. ibericus</i>. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were <i>M. ibericus</i>, and the bald ones were <i>M. structor</i>.</p>\n<p>Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared <i>M. ibericus</i> mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from <i>M. ibericus</i> queens.</p>\n<p>This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by <i>M. ibericus</i> queens: “xenoparity,” which essentially means “foreign birth.”</p>\n<p>The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of <i>M. structor</i> ants from an <i>M. ibericus</i> queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.</p>\n<p>“It was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it’s nearly impossible to have males,” says co-author <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QuMuD-gAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Jonathan Romiguier</a>, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2494855-queen-ant-makes-males-of-another-species-for-daughters-to-mate-with/\"> New Scientist</a>’s Tim Vernimmen. “We had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born. Then we got lucky.” Observing the births of </p>\n<p><i>M. structor</i>males was another key piece of evidence in describing the ants’ strange biology.</p>\n<p>As for the <i>M. ibericus</i> males in the colony, the queens mate with them to produce the next generation of <i>M. ibericus </i>queens.</p>\n<p>But why do <i>M. ibericus</i> queens clone <i>M. structor</i> males? Scientists aren’t totally sure, but they say the partnership must be beneficial to both species.</p>\n<p>For <i>M. ibericus,</i> this adaptation ensures they have plenty of workers, which are responsible for many important tasks in a colony, including building the nest, gathering food and raising the larvae. The arrangement also keeps <i>M. structor</i> males around for future <i>M. ibericus</i> queens to mate with, even in places without <i>M. structor</i> colonies. Shockingly, <i>M. structor</i> colonies are only found in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/one-queen-ant-two-species-the-discovery-that-reshapes-what-family-means-in-nature-264384\">mountainous areas</a> across a small range. But by transporting the <i>M. structor</i> male clones around, <i>M. ibericus</i> has allowed that species to spread to new places.</p>\n<p>However, the unique setup might not last forever. Because the <i>M. structor</i> males are clones and do not appear to be mating with members of their own species, they are probably accumulating harmful genetic mutations, which makes them more vulnerable in the long run, reports <i>New Scientist</i>. But, for now, the relationship seems to be working.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/these-ant-queens-seem-to-defy-biology-they-lay-eggs-that-hatch-into-another-species-180987292/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-compute-blade-10-node-ai-server.jpeg\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi AI 10 node compute blade server\"/></p>\n<p>I ordered a set of 10 Compute Blades in April 2023 (two years ago), and they just arrived a few weeks ago. In that time Raspberry Pi upgraded the CM4 to a CM5, so I ordered a set of 10 16GB CM5 Lite modules for my blade cluster. That should give me 160 GB of total RAM to play with.</p>\n<p>This was the biggest Pi cluster I've built, and it set me back around $3,000, shipping included:</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-pricing.png\" alt=\"10 Node Pi Cluster Pricing\"/></p>\n<p>There's another Pi-powered blade computer, the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1907647187/small-board-big-possibilities-xerxes-pi\">Xerxes Pi</a>. It's smaller and cheaper, but it just wrapped up <i>its own</i> Kickstarter. Will it ship in less than two years? Who knows, but I'm a sucker for crowdfunded blade computers, so of course I backed it!</p>\n<p>But my main question, after sinking in a substantial amount of money: are Pi clusters even <i>worth</i> it anymore? I There's no way this cluster could beat the $8,000, 4-node Framework Desktop cluster in performance. But what about in <i>price per gigaflop</i>, or in efficiency or compute density?</p>\n<p>There's only one way to find out.</p>\n<h2>Compute Blade Cluster Build</h2>\n<p>I made a video going over everything in this blog post—and the entire cluster build (and rebuild, and rebuild again) process. You can watch it here, or on YouTube:</p>\n<p>But if you're on the blog, you're probably not the type to sit through a video anyway. So moving on...</p>\n<h2>Clustering means doing everything over <i>n</i> times</h2>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/compute-blade-cluster-nvme-install.jpeg\" alt=\"Installing M.2 NVMe SSDs in Compute Blades\"/></p>\n<p>In the course of going from 'everything's in the box' to 'running AI and HPC benchmarks reliably', I rebuilt the cluster basically three times:</p>\n<ul><li>First, my hodgepodge of random NVMe SSDs laying around the office was unreliable. Some drives wouldn't work with the Pi 5's PCIe bus, it seems, other ones were a little flaky (there's a reason these were spares sitting around the place, and not in use!)</li><li>After replacing all the SSDs with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4lPJ0JC\">Patriot P300s</a>, they were more reliable, but the CM5s would throttle under load</li><li>I put <a href=\"https://amzn.to/45YACBV\">these CM heatsinks</a>on without screwing them in... then realized they would pop off sometimes, so I took all the blades out<i>again</i>and screwed them into the CM5s/Blades so they were more secure for the long term.</li></ul>\n<h2>Compute Blade Cluster HPL Top500 Test</h2>\n<p>The first benchmark I ran was my <a href=\"https://github.com/geerlingguy/top500-benchmark\">top500 High Performance Linpack cluster benchmark</a>. This is my favorite cluster benchmark, because it's the traditional benchmark they'd run on massive supercomputers to get on the <a href=\"https://www.top500.org\">top500 supercomputer list</a>.</p>\n<p>Before I installed heatsinks, the cluster got 275 Gflops, which is an 8.5x speedup over a single 8 GB CM5. Not bad, but I noticed the cluster was only using 105 Watts of power during the run. Definitely more headroom available.</p>\n<p>After fixing the thermals, the cluster did not throttle, and used around 130W. At full power, I got 325 Gflops, which is a 10x performance improvement (for 10x 16GB CM5s) over a single 8 GB CM5.</p>\n<p>Compared to the $8,000 <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms\">Framework Cluster I benchmarked last month</a>, this cluster is about 4 times slower:</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-hpl-cluster.png\" alt=\"Pi vs Framework Cluster HPL performance\"/></p>\n<p>But the Pi cluster is <i>slightly</i> more energy efficient, on a Gflops/W basis:</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-hpl-efficiency.png\" alt=\"Pi vs Framework Cluster HPL Efficiency\"/></p>\n<p>But what about price?</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-hpl-cost.png\" alt=\"Pi vs Framework Cluster Cost\"/></p>\n<p>The Pi is a little less cost-effective for HPC applications than a Framework Desktop running a AMD's fastest APU. So discounting the fact we're only talking CPUs, I don't think any hyperscalers are looking to swap out a few thousand AMD EPYC systems for 10,000+ Raspberry Pis :)</p>\n<p>But what about AI use cases?</p>\n<h2>Compute Blade Cluster AI Test</h2>\n<p>With 160 GB of total RAM, shared by the CPU and iGPU, this could be a small, efficient AI Cluster, right? Well, you'd think.</p>\n<p>But no: <a href=\"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/9801\">currently llama.cpp can't speed up AI using Vulkan on the Pi 5 iGPU</a>. That means we have 160 GB of RAM, but only CPU-powered inference. On pokey Arm Cortex A76 CPU cores with 10 GB/sec or so of memory bandwidth.</p>\n<p>A small model (Llama 3.2:3B), running on a single Pi, isn't horrible; you get about 6 tokens per second. But that is pretty weak compared to even an Intel N100 (much less a single Framework Desktop):</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-ai-llama-32-3b.png\" alt=\"AI model Llama 3.2 3B on Pi vs Framework vs N150\"/></p>\n<p>You could have 10 nodes running 10 models, and that might be a very niche use case, but the real test would be running a <i>larger</i> AI model across all nodes. So I switched tracks to Llama 3.3:70B, which is a 40 GB model. It <i>has</i> to run across multiple Pis, since no single Pi has more than 16 GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>Just as with the Framework cluster, llama.cpp RPC was <i>very</i> slow, since it splits up the model layers on all the cluster members, then goes round-robin style asking each node to perform its prompt processing, then token generation.</p>\n<p>The Pi cluster couldn't even make it to token generation (tg) on my default settings, so I had to dial things back and only generate 16 tokens at a time to allow it to complete.</p>\n<p>And after all that? Only 0.28 tokens per second, which is <i>25x slower</i> than the Framework Cluster, running the same model (except on AI Max iGPUs with Vulkan).</p>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/framework-vs-pi-cluster-ai-llama-33-70b-tg.png\" alt=\"Pi vs Framework Cluster AI token generation\"/></p>\n<p>I also tried <a href=\"https://github.com/exo-explore/exo\">Exo</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/b4rtaz/distributed-llama\">distributed-llama</a>. Exo was having trouble even running a small 3B model on even a 2 or 3 node Pi cluster configuration, so I stopped trying to get that working.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-regret-building-3000-pi-ai-cluster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/our-partners\">our partners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/p/advertiser-disclosure\">here's how we make money</a>.</p>\n<h2>Is the TikTok drama about to end for U.S. users?</h2>\n<p>The clock has been ticking on TikTok’s future in the United States for more than five years now, but the saga may soon be over.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the White House announced that a “framework” for a deal to allow the hugely popular social media app to continue operating in the U.S. was imminent, with President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping due to meet Friday to finalize details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-make-money-on-tiktok\">TikTok</a> is currently owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, and reportedly has more than 2 billion registered users globally.</p>\n<p>The app’s Chinese ownership is what sparked national security concerns during Trump’s first term. Those concerns have included the collection of Americans’ personal data, and that the presence of TikTok on so many phones creates a risk that China could inject malicious software onto U.S. devices.</p>\n<p>In first taking aim at ByteDance in 2020, Trump cited “credible evidence that leads me to believe that ByteDance … might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Since then TikTok has been the subject of numerous executive orders and legislative action.</p>\n<h3>The TikTok timeline</h3>\n<p>Trump issued his first executive orders over TikTok in August 2020, including one that gave ByteDance 90 days to divest itself of any assets supporting the app’s U.S. operations. TikTok immediately sued over the order. In the end, no further action was taken during Trump’s first term, and incoming President Joe Biden didn’t initially pursue the matter when he took office in January 2021.</p>\n<p>Concerns about TikTok began to surface again in 2023, though, and culminated in a sell-or-ban bill signed by Biden in April 2024, setting Jan. 19, 2025 as the deadline. TikTok sued again, and the Supreme Court upheld the law in a ruling on Jan. 17, 2025. The app went dark in the U.S. for about 14 hours on Jan. 18 and 19.</p>\n<p>Trump, who took office the next day, had become a fan of TikTok over the course of the 2024 campaign, praising its ability to reach young voters (“I like TikTok. It helped me get elected,” he said during a press conference this week in the U.K.). One of the first of his initial volley of day-one actions was an executive order extending the sell-or-ban deadline for 75 days. He has extended the ban several times, most recently on Tuesday, with the current deadline set to Dec. 16.</p>\n<h3>So what happens next?</h3>\n<p>Trump said this week that he would be speaking to Chinese president Xi on Friday to formalize a deal that would meet the terms of the sell-or-ban legislation. The Wall Street Journal and other sources have reported that a consortium of U.S. firms would hold 80% of the shares of a new U.S. company operating the app here, with Chinese shareholders owning the rest.</p>\n<p>It has also been reported that the new company would continue to use the current ByteDance algorithm, leading to concern from some lawmakers.</p>\n<p>In short, TikTok users are unlikely to see any changes as a result of the deal.</p>\n<h3>Who uses TikTok?</h3>\n<p>Short answer: Young people use TikTok. According to a 2024 study from Pew Research:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">57% of teens 13 to 17 years old say they use the app daily.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">34% of teens visit it several times a day.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p class=\"_28z5Fp _3-to_p\">16% of teens use it “almost constantly.”</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Only YouTube ranked higher, with 73% of teens saying they visit it daily. Facebook? Only 20% of teens visit it daily. That figure was 71% in 2014-2015.</p>\n<p>By contrast, 33% of adults in a separate 2024 Pew Research study said they “ever” use TikTok, putting it fifth among social platforms. In contrast to teens, 68% of adults report using Facebook.</p>\n<p>TikTok’s U.S. growth has not been hampered by the political controversy of the last five years. While ByteDance (a private company) doesn’t release registered user statistics by country, it claimed 100 million U.S. users in 2020 and 170 million users in 2025.</p>\n<h2>What are you paying for your music?</h2>\n<p>Most music listeners today are more into streaming than sales — kind of like renting instead of owning.</p>\n<p>Data shows that we may be listening more than ever: In 2024, on-demand audio streams increased by 6.5% to reach around 1.4 trillion, according to Luminate, an entertainment data and insights company. That figure dwarfs both digital album sales and physical album sales, including vinyl LP, CDs and cassettes. In 2024, digital album sales declined by 9.5% from 18.6 million to 16.8 million, while physical album sales stayed relatively flat — 55.6 million in 2024, down 1% from 56.2 million in 2023.</p>\n<p>People are more willing to pay for subscriptions to music platforms (not just ad-supported or free versions) than ever before: Streaming hit 100 million subscriptions up from 75.5 million in 2020, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/roundup-9-19-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That said, you'll also have a tough time getting a bulkier RV along poor roads to more remote areas.</p>\n<p>You should also consider any limitations to your own situation. For example, your current vehicle may not be able to pull a larger towable RV. Additionally, you should think about where you'll store your RV when you're not using it. Will it fit in your driveway, for example, or will you need to get (and pay for) a storage space?</p>\n<p>Lastly, be realistic about your driving skills. If you won't be comfortable at the wheel of a large trailer or navigating narrow roads with a bus-sized vehicle, you may want to look into smaller options.</p>\n<h3>Budgeting for an RV</h3>\n<p>RVs cost plenty. In 2024, you could expect to pay an average of $61,891 for a new RV, or $56,313 for a used model, according to the RV Industry Association. The spending doesn't end with buying a vehicle. Your budget should also be able to accommodate the following ongoing costs of RV ownership:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Interest on an RV loan:</strong>47% of RV buyers finance their purchase, according to a 2025 survey from Go RVing. You can use an<a href=\"https://www.calculator.net/auto-loan-calculator.html\">auto loan calculator</a>to get an idea of how much your monthly payments might be. Typical RV loan rates currently range from around 8% to 16%, according to the RV club Good Sam.</li><li><strong>Registration fees:</strong>As with most other motor vehicles, RVs must be registered and bear license plates. Unlike most other passenger vehicle classes, the fee for registration may be based on the RV's weight and run to hundreds of dollars per year, depending on the state.</li><li><strong>RV insurance:</strong>Most states require you to purchase<a href=\"https://money.com/best-rv-insurance/\">insurance for your motorhome</a>, and lenders generally insist that financed RVs be insured. Towable RVs are usually covered by your<a href=\"https://www.amica.com/en/resources/auto/coverage/liability-coverage.html\">car's liability coverage</a>. However, collision and comprehensive insurance for trailers must be purchased separately. Check with your car insurance company (and preferably some of its competitors, too) to get a cost estimate before you buy an RV.</li><li><strong>Camping costs:</strong>You'll generally pay fees when you stay in a campground or RV park.</li><li><strong>Repairs, maintenance and upgrades:</strong>RVs degrade over time, so you'll have to keep up with repairs and maintenance if you want to stay rolling. Unfortunately, you can't necessarily go to a regular car mechanic for repairs. You'll have to take your vehicle to a repair shop that has the space and expertise to handle an RV.</li></ul>\n<h3>New vs. used RVs</h3>\n<p>Whether you buy a brand-new or \"pre-enjoyed\" RV will affect the initial buying process and price. However, it will also have lasting implications that can affect how you use your vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros to a new RV </strong></p>\n<ul><li>Wider selection</li><li>Has a factory warranty</li><li>Greater expected reliability</li><li>Easier to source repair parts</li><li>Streamlined purchase process</li><li>New features and technology</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cons to a new RV </strong></p>\n<ul><li>Higher purchase price</li><li>Higher insurance premiums</li><li>Hefty (up to 30%) hit for depreciation</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Pros to a used RV </strong></p>\n<ul><li>Lower purchase price</li><li>Lower depreciation</li><li>Cheaper insurance premiums</li></ul>\n<p><strong>Cons to a used RV</strong></p>\n<ul><li>May not be covered by a warranty</li><li>Repair parts for older models may be scarce</li><li>More potential for mechanical problems</li><li>Greater likelihood of outdated designs and tech</li><li>State registration can be more complicated</li><li>Some campgrounds limit entry based on RV age</li></ul>\n<h3>Dealership vs. private seller</h3>\n<p>When shopping for a used RV, you'll have the option to buy from a dealership or directly from a private seller. Buying from a private seller is often considered cheaper than from a dealership, since private sellers generally don't have an overhead to cover. Additionally, buying from a private seller may give you more room to negotiate the price and other considerations.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://money.com/how-to-buy-an-rv/?xid=moneyrss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At the top of the list: Denver (-7%). The Mountain West metropolis is followed by several Sun Belt cities, including Austin (-6.5%) and Phoenix (-6.2%).</p>\n    <p>The downward trend across the U.S. is creating opportunities for renters to move to find better deals. \"High rental prices have been a major factor keeping many renters in place, leading to lower mobility,\" the report said. \"With asking rents declining over the past two years, renters now have greater incentives to relocate rather than stay put.\"</p>\n    <h2>Rent prices are falling, but remain elevated</h2>\n    <p>After peaking above $1,750 in August 2022, the median rent has since dropped by $46, or 2.6%, to $1,713 for 0-2 bedroom units. Rent prices are finally cooling amid a \"surge in new supply,\" the report said.</p>\n    <p>Still, it's a small decline in comparison to the spike that preceded it. Prices <a href=\"https://money.com/rent-increases-break-records-13-months/\">boomed</a> during the pandemic due to a shortage of rental properties and increases in home prices. Compared to 2019, the median rent is up 17% (or $249 per month).</p>\n    <p>Some cities have experienced steep rent declines since August 2022. \"In particular, rents in Las Vegas, Nevada (-13.6%), Atlanta, Georgia (-13.6%), and Austin, Texas (-13.4%), are seeing the largest declines from their peaks, highlighting prime opportunities in these markets,\" the report said.</p>\n    <h2>10 cities where rents are dropping fast</h2>\n    <p>August was the first month since March that rents dropped, likely \"signaling the start of the rental market’s seasonal slowdown,\" according to the report, which documented rent trends in the 50 largest metro statistical areas.</p>\n    <p>Here are the top 10 cities where median rents prices are dropping:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Denver, Colorado: $1,785 (-7% year-over-year)</li>\n      <li>Austin, Texas: $1,436 (-6.5%)</li>\n      <li>Phoenix, Arizona: $1,471 (-6.2%)</li>\n      <li>Raleigh, North Carolina: $1,471 (-5.9%)</li>\n      <li>Nashville, Tennessee: $1,515 (-5.1%)</li>\n      <li>San Diego, California: $2,720 (-4.9%)</li>\n      <li>Jacksonville, Florida: $1,482 (-4.9%)</li>\n      <li>Riverside, California: $2,089 (-4.8%)</li>\n      <li>Las Vegas, Nevada: $1,443 (-4.6%)</li>\n      <li>Louisville, Kentucky: $1,242 (-4.2%)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>More from Money:</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://money.com/best-mortgage-lenders/\">8 Best Mortgage Lenders of 2025</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://money.com/home-prices-rising-affordable-cities/\">Home Prices Are Back on the Rise — Even in 'Affordable' Cities</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://money.com/cities-where-home-sellers-concessions-rising/\">Top 10 U.S. Cities Where Home Sellers Are Offering Perks to Sweeten the Deal</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://money.com/rent-prices-falling-10-cities/?xid=moneyrss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Still, it can be a tough road ahead for many consumers, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/-debt-struggles-hit-consumers-at-all-income-levels-heres-why.html\">regardless of their income</a>, as they strive to make a dent in their <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/debt/\">debt payments</a>. </p>\n    <p>To break the cycle of debt, experts say, it helps to understand the conduct that led to the debt.</p>\n    <p>Often, \"it's tied to emotional spending,\" said Jack Howard, head of money wellness at Ally Bank. She said that overspending can stem from either scarcity or abundance, as well as a lack of understanding of one's own finances.</p>\n    <p>If you're struggling to pay down credit card and loan balances, the first step is to understand how much debt you owe and the behaviors that got you there, Howard said.</p>\n    <p>Once you have a list of your debt and the interest rates on those balances, consider these three strategies to help shrink your debt:</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>1. Find extra cash </h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/08/how-to-get-started-with-revenge-savings.html\">Create a budget</a>, understand your monthly income, and track your expenses. </p>\n    <p>\"Whether you are a school teacher, or a firefighter, or an executive working in a consulting firm, 50% of Americans today don't have a budget,\" said Mike Croxson, CEO of the NFCC, an organization of non-profit credit counseling agencies. \"Have a budget. Understand what you can afford to pay, what you cannot afford to pay.\"</p>\n    <p>Be ruthless about cutting out unnecessary expenses. Limit food delivery services and consider low-cost ways to spend time with friends, like volunteering together or going for a hike.</p>\n    <p>\"You want to have that connection, but it's often tied to dollars, so thinking of creative ways to still have those experiences without spending a lot of money,\" Howard said.</p>\n    <p>Use the cash you save by cutting out expenses to pay down debt.</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>2. Reduce credit card balances</h2>\n    <p>You can often negotiate a lower interest rate from credit card lenders. Most cardholders — 83% — who asked for a lower rate in the past year received one, according to a<a href=\"https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/lower-apr-ask/\"> recent LendingTree survey</a>. </p>\n    <p>Pay more than the minimum and automate the payments to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/why-on-time-debt-payments-may-not-boost-your-credit-score.html\">ensure they're made on time</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108124159-17435146103ED1-REQ-040125-EppersonTip9.jpg?v=1743514609&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Credit card debt?\"/>\n    <p>A balance transfer may be a good option if you can pay off the debt within the introductory 0% annual percentage rate offer, which usually lasts from 12 to 21 months. You must also pay a balance transfer fee, which is typically 3% to 5%.</p>\n    <p>Howard also recommends building your emergency cash reserves so that you're less likely to use a credit card for unexpected expenses. \"Instead of using the credit card, we're going to that emergency fund to help fill in those gaps,\" she said.</p>\n    <h2><a href=\"\"/>3. Shave off student loan debt </h2>\n    <p>As the Fed cuts interest rates, borrowers with variable-rate <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-heres-what-that-means-for-you.html\">private student loans </a>may automatically get a lower interest rate. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/10/how-you-could-save-under-trumps-student-loan-repayment-plan.html\">Federal student loan rates</a> are fixed and only reset once a year on July 1, so most borrowers won't be immediately affected by a rate cut.</p>\n    <p>For private and federal loans, making more than the minimum payment can save you money in interest and can be key to reducing the debt, experts say.</p>\n    <p>Also consider <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/fed-rate-cut-when-to-refinance-a-mortgage-car-loan-student-loan.html\">refinancing</a> private loans to a lower rate to make payments more affordable. Experts usually don't recommend refinancing federal loans into a private student loan, however, because federal loans offer borrowers more protections.</p>\n    <p>Although it is more challenging these days, borrowers with federal loans may still be eligible for <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/student-loan-repayment-plan-changes.html\">an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan</a>. An <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\">IDR plan</a> bases your monthly student loan payment amount on your income and family size. For some people, payments on an IDR plan can be as low as $0 per month. </p>\n    <p>To avoid <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/05/05/student-loan-default-collection-restarting.html\">defaulting on your federal loan payments</a>, go to <a href=\"http://studentaid.gov\">studentaid.gov</a> to find a repayment plan that works best for your budget. </p>\n    <p>Student loan debt \"can be so overwhelming, the amount, that people become paralyzed by it,\" Howard said. \"Shift from feeling paralyzed to understanding the numbers and having an action plan to pay it off.\"</p>\n    <p><strong>SIGN UP:</strong> <i>Money 101 </i><i>is an 8-week learning course on financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

Hijacked by the far-left, it made little impact bar some high-visibility street clashes.</p>\n<p>But a much bigger test came yesterday<strong>, </strong>with unions and left-wing parties organising mass demonstrations against the government's plans.</p>\n<p>In the words of veteran political commentator Nicolas Baverez: \"At this critical moment, when the very sovereignty and freedom of France and Europe are at stake, France finds itself paralysed by chaos, impotence and debt.\"</p>\n<p>President Macron insists he can extricate the country from the mess but he has just 18 months remaining of his second term.</p>\n<p>One possibility is that the country's inherent strengths – its wealth, infrastructure, institutional resilience – will see it through what many feel is a historic turning-point.</p>\n<p>But there is another scenario: that it emerges permanently weakened, prey to extremists of left and right, a new sick man of Europe.</p>\n<h2>Tensions with prime ministers</h2>\n<p>All of this dates back to Macron's disastrous dissolution of the National Assembly in the early summer of 2024. Far from producing a stronger basis for governing, the new parliament was now split three ways: centre, left and far-right.</p>\n<p>No single group could hope to form a functioning government because the other two would always unite against it.</p>\n<p>Michel Barnier and then François Bayrou each staggered through a few months as prime minister, but both fell on the central question that faces all governments: how the state should raise and spend its money.</p>\n<p>Bayrou, a 74-year-old centrist, made a totem out of the question of French debt – which now stands at more than €3 trillion, or around 114% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>\n<p>He wanted to stabilise repayments by cutting €44 billion from the 2026 budget.</p>\n<p>Bayrou was brought down when the left and far-right MPs united in a vote of confidence last week, but polls showed that many voters were also hostile to the prime minister's ideas, such as abolishing two national holidays to pay for more defence.</p>\n<p>Emmanuel Macron's immediate recourse has been to entrust a member of his inner circle to pioneer a new approach.</p>\n<p>Sébastien Lecornu, the 39-year-old named as prime minister last week, is a quietly-spoken Norman who became a presidential confidant over late-night sessions of whisky-and-chat at the Elysée.</p>\n<p>Following the appointment, Macron said he was convinced \"an agreement between the political forces is possible while respecting the convictions of each\".</p>\n<p>Macron is said to appreciate Lecornu's loyalty, and a sense that his prime minister is not obsessed with his own political future.</p>\n<p>After tensions with his two predecessors – the veterans Michel Barnier and François Bayrou – today the president and prime minister see eye-to-eye.</p>\n<p>\"With Lecornu, it basically means that Macron is prime minister,\" argues Philippe Aghion, an economist who has advised the president and knows him well.</p>\n<p>\"Macron and Lecornu are essentially one.\"</p>\n<h2>Lecornu's Herculean task</h2>\n<p>Macron wants Lecornu to carry out a shift. From leaning mainly towards the political right, Macron now wants a deal with the left – specifically the Socialist Party (PS).</p>\n<p>By law, Lecornu needs to have tabled a budget by mid-October. This must then be passed by year-end.</p>\n<p>Arithmetically the only way he can do that is if his centrist bloc is joined by \"moderates\" to its right and left – in other words the conservative Republicans (LR) and the Socialists (PS).</p>\n<p>But the problem is this: every concession to one side makes it only more likely that the other side will walk out.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n6vr2eyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A much-awaited deal over TikTok may be close, with US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping set to discuss terms on Friday.</p>\n<p>Top officials from both sides struck a \"framework\" agreement this week, which reports suggest could see TikTok's US operations sold to a group of American firms.</p>\n<p>If the deal goes through, it would be what one expert called a \"rare breakthrough\" in US-China trade negotiations - and one which settles an issue that has made headlines for years.</p>\n<p>Experts have been telling the BBC what a final deal might look like for TikTok's 170 million US users, and what Beijing might get in return.</p>\n<h2>The US may not get the 'secret sauce'</h2>\n<p>Chinese state media is calling it a \"win-win\" for both countries, while Trump has said \"I'd like to do it for the kids\".</p>\n<p>But a lot about \"it\" still remains unclear.</p>\n<p>Reports suggest that American users would be offered a new US-specific version of the app. And that the US operations could be bought by a consortium that includes technology giant Oracle, and investment firms Andreessen Horowitz and Silver Lake. The BBC has contacted the companies for comment.</p>\n<p>But what exactly is on the table? At the heart of the tussle is TikTok's algorithm - the \"secret sauce\" that recommends content to users based on their preferences and behaviours.</p>\n<p>It's key because it drives the app's virality and appeal. Other companies have tried to re-create the algorithm - Instagram has Reels, YouTube has Shorts - but they are not as good, a former social media executive who worked for Snap and Viber told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>\"Generally, the one who introduces the technology just knows how to do it better.\"</p>\n<p>TikTok's Chinese owner, Bytedance, understandably refused to part with the prized formula, and Beijing backed the firm.</p>\n<p>But in a twist few saw coming, China's top cybersecurity regulator has signalled that Beijing may allow ByteDance to license the algorithm and other intellectual property (IP) to a US company owner. But it will not be transferred outright.</p>\n<p>It's a major departure from China's previous hardline stance over the algorithm.</p>\n<p>But there's every chance the US version will run on a \"stripped-down\" version of the app's software, said computing expert Kokil Jaidka from the National University of Singapore.</p>\n<p>Even limited access could reveal how the technology drives engagement, moderation and ad targeting - all the things that make the app so profitable, she adds.</p>\n<p>\"It simply doesn't make business sense for ByteDance to hand over its most valuable asset when a lighter version can keep the app running without giving away its edge.\"</p>\n<p>But these changes will affect the user experience - the app may show less diverse content than users might see elsewhere, Dr Jaidka adds.</p>\n<p>\"A lighter, slower, more domestic version - while ByteDance keeps the crown jewels in Beijing.\"</p>\n<h2>The deal could still be a while away</h2>\n<p>The user experience will remain the same, and with \"Chinese characteristics\", according to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading his side's negotiating team.</p>\n<p>The \"Chinese characteristics\" may well be the problem though - that is, in fact, a phrase often used by the Chinese Communist Party to differentiate its way of doing things.</p>\n<p>US officials, including Trump during his first term, have long raised concerns about who has access to TikTok's data, and the influence the app has over US users.</p>\n<p>These questions over national security spurred legislation that former president Joe Biden signed into law last year, requiring TikTok to hand over control of its US operations or face a ban.</p>\n<p>Trump has since changed his mind, crediting TikTok for boosting young voter support in his 2024 election win.</p>\n<p>But a sale must still satisfy US lawmakers and allay the worries that kickstarted everything. Congress is likely to need to approve any agreement, and there is already political backlash in Washington on both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Republican lawmaker John Moolenaar has said he is concerned that the agreed framework could still allow Chinese government influence and control.</p>\n<p>\"Put simply: the statute requires full separation from 'foreign adversary' control, and a license would not appear to meet that test,\" lawyer Hdeel Abdelhady told the BBC.</p>\n<p>Deals of this size typically take months or even years to complete, and there are a number of issues to resolve.</p>\n<p>For one, it is not clear how US-owned and operated TikTok would interact with TikTok elsewhere, which would be still be owned by ByteDance.</p>\n<p>And two, ByteDance, being a private company, would need approval from its board for the arrangement to proceed.</p>\n<p>That adds a layer of complication even if the Chinese government - which enforces export controls on advanced technologies like algorithms - has already approved the deal.</p>\n<p>And the US president himself, who has proven to be an unpredictable trade partner, could create fresh complications.</p>\n<h2>Beijing buys time - and leverage</h2>\n<p>We know Trump is keen on a TikTok deal, and we know why.</p>\n<p>It would be a big win for his administration. One in seven people in the world use the app, which also doubles up as a huge marketplace for buyers and sellers across the world, from the US to Germany, Indonesia to the Philippines.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dxq0jz2l9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
