A captivated audience in Tokyo remained in the stadium long after Monday night's other events had concluded to watch the sport's modern-day great become the first human to clear the 6.30m barrier. The 25-year-old has now claimed the past eight global men's pole vault gold medals on offer across both indoor and outdoor competitions following this triumph in the Japanese capital. Returning to the stadium where he achieved the first of those major successes four years ago, Duplantis owned his latest moment in the spotlight with his charisma and breathtaking talent.

Duplantis clears 6.30m to break world record The two-time Olympic champion sealed gold with a first-time clearance at 6.15m to end Emmanouil Karalis' admirable challenge then raised the bar to one centimetre higher than he had ever gone before. Such is the respect from his competitors, the Greek runner-up - who has risen to fourth on the discipline's all-time list amid his pursuit of Duplantis - held a fan for his rival between his agonisingly close first and second attempts. With all eyes fixed upon him, a hush of expectation was replaced by rhythmic applause upon Duplantis' request as he prepared for his final attempt. Japan's National Stadium then erupted as he leapt up from the mat after his successful effort and began his celebrations. \"To be able to give you guys this world record is just amazing,\" Duplantis told the crowd, after 23:00 local time. A fourth world record of 2025 by Duplantis is the most occasions he has improved the mark in a single year in his career, which seemingly continues with no limit in sight. More to follow.

The stolen data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses and the total amount spent in the luxury stores around the world. Kering, the parent company of the luxury brands, has confirmed the breach and says it disclosed the incident to the relevant data protection authorities. It said no financial information, such as card details, were stolen. The firm also says it has emailed customers affected but has not said how many, or made any public statements about the hack. Legally, the company is not obligated to make any public statements about the breach as long as it has notified all individuals affected through other means. The cyber criminal behind the attack calls themselves Shiny Hunters. They claim to have data linked to 7.4m unique email addresses which suggests the total number of individual victims could be similar. A small sample shared with the BBC as proof contained thousands of customer details which appear to be genuine. Once analysed the files were deleted. One of the details in the stolen data is \"Total Sales\" which shows how much money a person has spent with each brand. Some customers are shown to have spent more than $10,000 with a handful spending $30,000-$86,000 in stores in the small sample analysed by the BBC. This information is particularly concerning for victims as it could lead to high spenders being targeted by secondary hacks and scams if the hacker decides to leak the information to other criminals. Shiny Hunters appears to be acting alone and told the BBC over Telegram chat that they breached the luxury brands in April through Kering. The hacker contacted the French company in early June and claims to have been in on-off negotiations with them over a ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. This is denied by the company which says it has not engaged in any conversations with the criminal. The company says it has refused to pay the hacker in accordance with long-standing law enforcement advice. \"In June, we identified that an unauthorized third party gained temporary access to our systems and accessed limited customer data from some of our Houses. No financial information - such as bank account numbers, credit card information, or government-issued identification numbers - was involved in the incident,\" a Kering spokesperson said adding it has since secured its IT systems. The data breach which happened in April came at the time of a wave of attacks on luxury brands including Cartier and Louis Vuitton also disclosed breaches to customers and the public. It's not known if those attacks are linked to Shiny Hunters. In June, cyber security experts at Google issued a warning about a trend of attacks linked to Shiny Hunters that the tech giant also subsequently fell victim to. The hacker or hackers are known by Google as UNC6040 which have been stealing data through tricking employees into handing over their log in details for internal company Salesforce software. What to do you if your information has been stolen Stolen information in cyber-attacks may include your name, address, date of birth and online order history. Scammers may use these to try and look genuine and contact you pretending to be another organisation, including a bank or government. So it's important to stay vigilant if you receive suspicious emails, messages or phone calls. Be aware that scammers often try and press you to do something urgently. If you do get a call from your bank and are unsure if it's genuine, hang up and call the number on your card or the bank's website. The National Cyber Security Agency says you should change your password, and use two-factor authentication if possible. Passwords made up of three random words are harder to crack, and do not reuse password across multiple accounts.

This video can not be played Media caption, England dominate Scotland to set up semi-final with France Published 22 minutes ago England surpassed their own record winning streak across both men's and women's international rugby union by defeating Scotland 40-8 in their Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final in Bristol. In 2022, the Red Roses became the first team in history to win 25 Tests in a row by beating Wales in a World Cup warm-up game at Ashton Gate and that record was extended by five more victories - until it ended with a defeat by New Zealand at the World Cup final later that year. Since that dramatic loss, England have not lost a Test and they broke new ground with a 31st consecutive win on Sunday. If they are to lift the World Cup on 27 September at Twickenham, then the record will be extended to 33. Here are the stats behind their incredible winning run. Prior to losing the most recent World Cup final in Auckland, the Red Roses' previous defeat had come against the Black Ferns in 2019. Not since a Women's Six Nations defeat by France in 2018 have England lost to a team other than the reigning world champions. It has been 1,038 days (as of 15 September) since England have lost a game. England sweep aside Scotland to reach semi-finals Published 21 hours ago Who plays who in Rugby World Cup semi-finals? Published 20 hours ago The current 31-game winning run started under former head coach Simon Middleton, who, after the World Cup final defeat in 2022, led the Red Roses to a Women's Six Nations Grand Slam in 2023. Since taking charge midway through the 2023 WXV1 campaign, John Mitchell has won 26 games as head coach, winning back-to-back WXV1 titles and successive Six Nations Grand Slams. Mitchell remains undefeated as England head coach and is yet to lose a game in charge. Mitchell chose to change the team's captain in January, with Zoe Aldcroft taking over from Marlie Packer, who had spent two seasons leading England. Number eight Alex Matthews has also captained the side twice, most recently in England's final pool game of the World Cup against Australia in Brighton. Former captain Sarah Hunter, who captained the Red Roses to the World Cup final in 2022, is now the side's defence coach.

In terms of the winning run nearly ending, England held off a late France fightback in this year's Six Nations Grand Slam finale to win 43-42. Les Bleues also lost by five points in front of a record women's crowd of 58,498 at Twickenham in 2023. World Cup contenders Canada lost by nine points at last year's WXV1 in Vancouver, conceding a try in the final play, while world champions New Zealand were defeated by 12 points at Twickenham last September.

News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast the Tuesday arraignment, a judge ruled Monday night. Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed. Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. All Catch Up 34 Posts Our live coverage of Trump’s historic indictment has moved. Link Copied! Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says From CNN's Tierney Sneed Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.” In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms. “That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.” Link Copied! Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins From CNN's Tierney Sneed News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin. Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom. However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.” Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position. The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.” Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week. The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.

US ambassador to UN describes Russia running the UNSC as an \"April Fool's joke\" From CNN's Richard Roth in New York Linda Thomas-Greenfield at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC on March 1. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Monday described Russia assuming the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency this month as “an April Fool’s joke.” “But the truth of the matter is, it’s a rotating seat. We expect that they will behave professionally. But we also expect that they will use their seat to spread disinformation and to promote their own agenda as it relates to Ukraine, and we will stand ready to call them out at every single moment that they attempt to do that,” Greenfield added. Greenfield said she is not surprised if the Russians asked the foreign minister to come to UNSC headquarters in New York but also said council does work beyond Ukraine. “We haven’t decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month. The Security Council does more than Ukraine. We work on many issues, and we again expect that Russia will carry their presidency in a professional way, but when they don’t, we will stand ready to call them out,” Greenfield said. Link Copied! Finland to be inducted into NATO and Russia pushes back on UN Security presidency concerns. Here's the latest From CNN staff Vasily Nebenzya , Russian ambassador to the United Nations, dismissed concerns that Russia could fairly be the president of the Security Council for April during the ongoing war in Ukraine. He said there were no complaints in February 2022 when Russia was last president of the council, while Russia invaded and pointed out that the US was president of the council in 2003 — the year Iraq was invaded. The ambassador said as long as world order is maintained, there will not be any change in UN procedures that might lead to a change in Russia’s status. Russia took over presidency on Saturday of the UN’s top security body, which rotates every month.

US sailors recover a suspected Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon that was downed by the United States over US territorial waters off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on February 5, 2023. U.S. Fleet Forces/U.S. Navy/Reuters Washington CNN — The Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about. Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations. A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.” The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said . As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military. The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed. CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence. - Source: CNN \" data-fave-thumbnails=\"{\"big\": { \"uri\": \"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_540,w_960,c_fill\" }, \"small\": { \"uri\": \"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_540,w_960,c_fill\" } }\" data-vr-video=\"false\" data-show-html=\" The Lead \" data-byline-html=\" \" data-timestamp-html=\" Updated 9:38 AM EDT, Mon April 3, 2023 \" data-check-event-based-preview=\"\" data-is-vertical-video-embed=\"false\" data-network-id=\"\" data-publish-date=\"2023-03-23T22:32:49Z\" data-video-section=\"politics\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/03/23/chinese-surveillance-spy-balloons-justin-trudeau-intv-newton-the-lead-vpx.cnn\" data-branding-key=\"\" data-video-slug=\"chinese-surveillance-spy-balloons-justin-trudeau-intv-newton-the-lead-vpx\" data-first-publish-slug=\"chinese-surveillance-spy-balloons-justin-trudeau-intv-newton-the-lead-vpx\" data-video-tags=\"asia,china,continents and regions,domestic alerts,domestic-us politics,east asia,government and public administration,government bodies and offices,heads of government,heads of state,iab-politics,international alerts,international-us politics,joe biden,justin trudeau,misc people,paula newton,political figures - intl,political figures - us,politics\" data-breakpoints='{\"video-resource--media-extra-large\": 660}' data-display-video-cover=\"true\" data-details=\"\"> Video Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 - Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.

But this time it has more to lose Analysis by Simone McCarthy 6 min read Updated 3:49 AM EDT, Tue April 4, 2023 Link Copied! Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen waves as she arrives at a hotel in New York during a stopover on Thursday, March 30, 2023 a day before flying to Central America. John Minchillo/AP Hong Kong CNN — An anticipated meeting between Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei. At that time, Beijing encircled the island democracy with unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait. It also cut off contact with the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty. This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead. - Source: CNN \" data-fave-thumbnails=\"{\"big\": { \"uri\": \"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230314104819-biden.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_540,w_960,c_fill\" }, \"small\": { \"uri\": \"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230314104819-biden.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_540,w_960,c_fill\" } }\" data-vr-video=\"false\" data-show-html=\" \" data-byline-html=\" \" data-timestamp-html=\" Updated 3:49 AM EDT, Tue April 4, 2023 \" data-check-event-based-preview=\"\" data-is-vertical-video-embed=\"false\" data-network-id=\"\" data-publish-date=\"2023-03-14T15:23:33Z\" data-video-section=\"world\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/03/14/taiwan-china-us-relation-tension-ripley-pkg-vpx.cnn\" data-branding-key=\"\" data-video-slug=\"taiwan-china-us-relation-tension-ripley-pkg-vpx\" data-first-publish-slug=\"taiwan-china-us-relation-tension-ripley-pkg-vpx\" data-video-tags=\"asia,brand safety-nsf sensitive,brand safety-nsf war and military,china,continents and regions,domestic alerts,domestic-international news,domestic-us politics,east asia,international alerts,international-us politics,military,misc people,north america,taiwan,the americas,united states,unrest, conflicts and war,will ripley\" data-breakpoints='{\"video-resource--media-extra-large\": 660}' data-display-video-cover=\"true\" data-details=\"\"> Video Ad Feedback See why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan 02:32 - Source: CNN See why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan 02:32 It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to “serious” confrontation between the two powers. A defiant Tsai staked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies. But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations and ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say. “This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil. The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response. “Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023. J.

    "body": "<p>Haaland scores twice as Man City cruise to win against Man Utd</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Published</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <strong>It was a Manchester derby to forget for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United, with defeat at the Etihad meaning the Portuguese's Premier League record now reads eight wins from 31 matches.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>But was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c62q3y96n38t\">Sunday's 3-0 loss</a> a case of a faulty philosophy, individual mistakes, or an impressive performance from Manchester City?</p>\n<p>Here we analyse the game, focusing on both teams' tactics.</p>\n<h2>How City created a four v two in midfield</h2>\n<p>City focused much of their play down the left-hand side in the first half.</p>\n<p>Blues boss Pep Guardiola aimed to exploit weaknesses in United's defensive approach, with an eye on their back five, two central midfielders and the aggressive manner in which the wider centre-backs are asked to step out to press.</p>\n<p>The hosts' left-back - Nico O'Reilly - took a wider position on the touchline, aiming to draw United right wing-back Noussair Mazraoui towards him.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Doku - City's left winger - would ordinarily have been marked by Mazraoui, but as O'Reilly took the wide position, Doku was more central.</p>\n<p>That gave Mazraoui the difficult task of knowing who to pick up. His decision was to ignore Doku and instead defend the wide spaces - stepping up to press O'Reilly when the ball went to him.</p>\n<p>Doku's inside position ensured City had an overload around United's midfield.</p>\n<p>Rodri, Phil Foden (who had dropped deeper), Doku (who had moved inside) and Tijjani Reijnders formed a box around United's midfield duo.</p>\n<p>It was the same tactic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2djywy3754o\">Fulham used against United</a> earlier this season, when Alex Iwobi vacated his left-wing position to create an overload in midfield.</p>\n<p>O'Reilly stands on the touchline, Doku moves into midfield and City have an overload centrally</p>\n<h2>United's disjointed press</h2>\n<p>With Doku infield, it was Leny Yoro - United's right centre-back - who was tasked with pushing up aggressively on him.</p>\n<p>That is a difficult ask for a natural central defender, especially with Doku dropping as deep as his own half, and it was made more difficult as Foden also occupied those areas.</p>\n<p>Yoro's front-footed defending made the midfield battle a four against three - rather than four against two - at times, but he would often retreat when City's players moved deeper as he did not want to end up too far from his backline.</p>\n<p>By not committing entirely to backing up the press in a man-to-man fashion, United's press was disjointed - meaning City had a free man somewhere.</p>\n<p>United captain Bruno Fernandes touched on this after the match, admitting his team needed to be \"more brave with full pressure\" to prevent the opening goal.</p>\n<p>\"City take that risk against us - we need to do the same,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"I was trying to press Rodri because the aim of the midfielders was for one to jump on Rodri, with one of the defenders on Foden.</p>\n<p>\"In the first moment, I can cover both but Leny comes up so I go more on Rodri. And Leny was going backwards because of a miscommunication and we end up giving too much space on the pitch.\"</p>\n<p>A team-wide man-to-man press would ensure easy passing options aren't available for the opposition.</p>\n<p>As Fernandes mentions, it was the job of one of the defenders - namely Yoro - to jump on Foden. But the clever positioning of O'Reilly and movement of Doku meant he was left in two minds.</p>\n<p>Foden was able to receive the ball under no pressure and carry it up the pitch - a situation that was replicated later in the game.</p>\n<p>Yoro was tasked with stepping up to press Foden but Doku's movement infield meant he had an extra player to pay attention to</p>\n<h2>City's clever use of pinning</h2>\n<p>City's use of pinning was particularly impressive.</p>\n<p>Pinning is the act of positioning a player in a certain area with the result an opponent also has to stay there.</p>\n<p>If a winger stands on the touchline next to the opposition full-back, for example, the defender is unlikely to leave that area as the attacker would be free. The winger has, therefore, 'pinned' the full-back.</p>\n<p>City used pinning throughout Sunday's game to make United's aggressive defending tactics weaker, and to open up space for their attackers.</p>\n<p>We've already spoken about how O'Reilly pinned Mazraoui to the touchline, leaving Doku free to move inside without being followed.</p>\n<p>On the other flank, we saw clever movement from Reijnders on to Luke Shaw that prevented him from leaving the back five. As a result, Doku's unorthodox positioning - having vacated his flank - allowed him to pick up the ball unopposed.</p>\n<p>Amorim asks his wide centre-backs to step out and apply pressure to the extra opposition player if United are outnumbered in midfield, but with Shaw stuck with Reijnders, City had Doku free.</p>\n<p>Given time, Doku was able to turn and drive with the ball and provided the assist for the first goal.</p>\n<p>With Shaw focused on Reijnders, Doku can receive the ball without pressure.</p>\n<h2>United's midfielders fail to track runners</h2>\n<p>For City's first goal, Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were back in defensive positions, but the hosts were able to pick up the loose ball in the penalty area uncontested.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckge4jpy4l5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

Britain's engineering firm Rolls Royce has been selected to design and build the first in the country.</p>\n    <p>One of the commercial deals set to be signed this week is with US nuclear group X-Energy and the UK's Centrica, which owns British Gas, to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool.</p>\n    <p>Unlike SMRs, which are water-cooled nuclear reactors, advanced modular reactors use gases such as helium as a coolant.</p>\n    <p>There are very few AMRs in the world operating on a commercial basis such as China's HTR-PM reactor.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy wants to build one in the US but, after announcing a partnership with US chemicals and plastics giant Dow in 2021, it has taken until March this year to submit a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project in Texas.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy has said it hopes the reactor at a Dow site could be a blueprint for others and \"manufacturers worldwide could replicate this model\".</p>\n    <p>The government said the Hartlepool deal has the potential to power 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 jobs.</p>\n    <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid, skilled jobs for working people.\"</p>\n    <p>But Greenpeace questioned the UK's focus on nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>\"If these proposals for new reactors scattered around Britain really materialise, the net effect will be higher bills from nuclear's relentlessly spiralling costs, and more CO2 as we wait for the builders to overcome their inevitable construction delays,\" said Dr Douglas Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK.</p>\n    <p>The cost of building large nuclear plants in the UK, such as Sizewell C in Suffolk, has jumped to £38bn from a previous estimate of £20bn. Centrica is one of the key investors in Sizewell C.</p>\n    <p>SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity, but have around a third of the generating output.</p>\n    <p>The modular element means they could be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station.</p>\n    <p>However, the SMR industry is still young, and many different designs are being investigated.</p>\n    <p>Centrica's chief executive Chris O'Shea told the BBC's Today programme that increased costs and delays \"can happen in all large projects\".</p>\n    <p>But he said: \"What you need to do is you need to do more than just one every 20 years in order to get better. So, the more you practice, the better you get which is why small and advanced modular reactors are particularly interesting because they'll be repetitive so you'll produce the same thing over and over again.</p>\n    <p>\"That should bring improvements both in terms of cost and schedule and reliability and cost as well.\"</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he wants the UK to return <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o\">to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\"</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzevzwxwro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

    "body": "<p>Fourteen NHS trusts are to have their maternity services examined over what has been described as \"failures in the system\", the government has said.</p>\n<p>The inquiries are part of a rapid review of maternity care in England that was announced in June.</p>\n<p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting said bereaved families had shown \"extraordinary courage\" in coming forward with issues dating back more than 15 years.</p>\n<p>Some of the families have severely criticised the review and Streeting's handling of it, describing the investigation as \"not fit for purpose\".</p>\n<p>The NHS trusts that will be examined are:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Blackpool Teaching Hospitals</li>\n      <li>Bradford Teaching Hospitals</li>\n      <li>University Hospitals of Leicester</li>\n      <li>Leeds Teaching Hospitals</li>\n      <li>Sandwell and West Birmingham</li>\n      <li>Gloucestershire Hospitals</li>\n      <li>Yeovil District Hospital</li>\n      <li>Oxford University Hospital</li>\n      <li>University Hospitals Sussex</li>\n      <li>Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals</li>\n      <li>Queen Elizabeth, Kings Lynn</li>\n      <li>University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay</li>\n      <li>East Kent Hospitals</li>\n      <li>Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Baroness Amos, who will chair the review, said she was committed to ensuring families affected by maternity care failures were heard and that the 14 investigations would lead to improvements nationwide.</p>\n<p>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she hoped the review would help families \"get the justice that they want and that they deserve\".</p>\n<p>She added that the current situation - in which trusts had been investigated already and \"hundreds\" of recommendations made, yet fresh reviews were required - was \"completely unacceptable\".</p>\n<p>Improved maternity care may have prevented the deaths of over 800 babies lives in 2022-23, according to research by the baby loss charities Sands and Tommy's.</p>\n<p>Streeting opted for the rapid review instead of a national inquiry into maternity care, which many families have been calling for.</p>\n<p>The review was due to be completed by December, but will now not report until Spring 2026. Baroness Amos says she will aim to produce interim findings around Christmas.</p>\n<p>The review will examine the experience of families and staff within England's struggling maternity services and investigate why the recommendations from previous maternity inquiries in Morecambe Bay, East Kent, and Shrewsbury and Telford have not led to sustained improvements.</p>\n<p>Past inquiries have revealed issues including ignoring women's voices, poor leadership, a failure to learn from safety incidents and a toxic culture. Yet families are still repeatedly reporting substandard care.</p>\n<p>There will also be \"particular attention\" paid to examining why black and Asian families have noticeably poorer outcomes, Baroness Amos said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Health said the trusts had been chosen based on data analysis and the views of families, as well as to ensure a geographical and demographic mix.</p>\n<p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the focus on these trusts would \"create real anxiety among women, families and staff\" at the 14 trusts.</p>\n<p>It added that the review would need to re-build a world class maternity system.</p>\n<p>\"Too many women and babies are not getting the safe, compassionate care they deserve and the maternity workforce is on its knees, with staff leaving the profession,\" said the college's president, Prof Ranee Thakar.</p>\n<p>The strongest criticism of the review, however, comes from the Maternity Safety Alliance (MSA) - a group of families harmed by poor maternity care in several NHS trusts across England.</p>\n<p>Having engaged in a number of meetings with the Department of Health in recent weeks, they said Streeting had \"broken promises\" over how the investigation would be run and what it would examine, and that they had been left feeling \"used\".</p>\n<p>They are particularly critical of the decision not to investigate the role of NHS regulators, such as the Care Quality Commission and NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance and litigation arm.</p>\n<p>\"The review seems to have already decided that all the responsibility for these 800 deaths a year lies squarely with NHS trusts and the clinicians who work in them,\" said Tom Hender, who lost his son Aubrey in 2022.</p>\n<p>\"That's just not true - the whole system is in crisis and we need a whole system approach.\"</p>\n<p>The MSA said the investigation was \"not fit for purpose\" and will not achieve what Streeting said it would, adding: \"It is clear that only a statutory public inquiry can end the crisis in maternity care.\"</p>\n<p>Baroness Amos said the terms of the review were extensive given its time frame and that regulatory bodies were \"not excluded\", but added: \"The kind of in-depth review that is being requested is not something that I am able to conduct.\"</p>\n<p>The two families who successfully campaigned for an investigation into maternity care in Shrewsbury and Telford are more positive about the review, describing it as \"an important and brave first step\".</p>\n<p>But the parents of Kate Stanton-Davies and Pippa Griffiths also said it would be \"safer\" if the review proceeded at a slower pace, adding that proper mental health support had to be provided to those families sharing their experiences.</p>\n<p>\"It's not enough to have a nominal support figure in the room and an email address for follow-up,\" they said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The ongoing challenges facing maternity services were highlighted last week.</p>\n<p>On Monday, a review of care at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS trust found that the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rvqd7v52ro\">nine babies</a> between 2020 and 2023 could have been prevented.  </p>\n<p>Then on Friday, a report found that NHS trusts rated over half their maternity and neonatal buildings as being unsatisfactory, with 7% saying they ran a serious risk of imminent breakdown.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg6xj1vz70o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

About 15 others were wounded.</p>\n<p>The non-jury trial is taking place at Belfast Crown Court, where Soldier F is screened from public view by a black curtain around part of the dock.</p>\n<p>The former paratrooper, whose identity remains protected by a court order, has entered pleas of not guilty.</p>\n<p>He also denies the five counts of attempted murder.</p>\n<p>Soldier F is further accused of attempting to murder Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon, Michael Quinn and an unknown person.</p>\n<p>Three of those he allegedly wounded will testify during the trial.</p>\n<h2>'Unjustified'</h2>\n<p>Prosecution lawyer Louis Mably KC said the shootings were \"unjustified\" and none of the victims posed any threat.</p>\n<p>\"They were unarmed and shot as they ran away.\"</p>\n<p>Mr Mably went on to allege that the soldiers who fired, including Soldier F, then gave a false account of what had happened.</p>\n<p>\"What they did was to falsely claims that the civilians they targeted were armed.</p>\n<p>\"It was demonstrably false.\"</p>\n<p>Mr Mably told the court Bloody Sunday had had a \"long lasting and profound effect\" on Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>He said the trial would have a narrow and specific focus on events that took place in a courtyard in the Glenfada Park area of Derry's Bogside.</p>\n<p>Soldier F, he said, was \"part of a small group of soldiers who moved west from Rossville Street into that courtyard\".</p>\n<p>That group of soldiers, he added, opened fire \"with their self-loading rifles shooting at the civilians as they ran away\".</p>\n<p>\"And the result was the casualties that I've described, two deaths and four men wounded.\"</p>\n<p>He said the civilians in the courtyard were unarmed and \"did not pose a threat to the soldiers and nor could the soldiers have believed that they did\".</p>\n<p>The soldiers' statements would be subject to a hearsay application on Wednesday that would determine their admissibility, Mr Mably said.</p>\n<p>That hearing, he said, is the first \"substantive matter\" in the case.</p>\n<h2>'Disgraced British army'</h2>\n<p>Setting out the circumstances of the shootings in the courtyard at Glenfada Park, Mr Mably told the court those who had been shot had been hit in the back or side, as they headed towards an exit onto Abbey Street.</p>\n<p>The soldiers, who he described as \"unprofessional\", had lost control of themselves, he said.</p>\n<p>\"Shooting people as they ran away... an act which disgraced the British army,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Families and friends of those killed on Bloody Sunday as well as scores of supporters took part in a walk to the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast on Monday, ahead of the opening of the trial.</p>\n<p>Those at the front of march carried a large banner saying: \"Towards Justice\".</p>\n<p>Tony Doherty, chair of the Bloody Sunday Trust, said: \"This day is a tribute to the strength of the families, whose indefatigable campaign for justice has made this happen.\"</p>\n<p>Speaking on behalf of the McKinney family before entering the court, John McKinney said it marked \"a momentous day in our battle to secure justice for our loved ones\".</p>\n<p>He said families had battled \"against the odds\" to get here.</p>\n<p>\"We will shortly occupy the courtroom with our heads held high and with the knowledge that regardless of the ultimate outcome that we are on the right side of history,\" he said.</p>\n<h2>Legacy process</h2>\n<p>Northern Ireland veterans commissioner David Johnstone claimed former soldiers were being subjected to \"wholesale demonisation\" as a result of the legacy process in Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>Johnstone called for \"a fair and balanced\" legacy process.</p>\n<p>\"The vast majority, and this is important, the vast, vast majority of nearly 300,000 Armed Forces that served here in Northern Ireland during Op Banner (Operation Banner), did so with dignity, with restraint and with professionalism, working to protect communities and to prevent civil war here in this province,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He added that \"the stories of soldiers murdered by terrorists receive little media attention, and there's certainly no prospect of a public inquiry into their deaths\".</p>\n<p>Also speaking outside the court, TUV leader Jim Allister said he had stopped off on his way to London to \"show his support\" for veterans.</p>\n<p>The decision to charge Soldier F was taken by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in 2019.</p>\n<p>He was one of 18 former soldiers reported to the PPS as a result of a police investigation, which followed the public inquiry into Bloody Sunday conducted by Lord Saville.</p>\n<p>But he was the only one charged.</p>\n<p>Two years later, the PPS dropped the case after the collapse of the trial of two other veterans who had been accused of a 1972 murder in Belfast.</p>\n<p>But the prosecution resumed in 2022 after a legal challenge.</p>\n<p>The key evidence in the Soldier F case is statements given by other soldiers at the time of Bloody Sunday.</p>\n<p>The trial judge is likely to decide at an early stage if they are admissible.</p>\n<h2>Who is

Speaking at a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\". Israel's decision to target senior Hamas leaders in Qatar - a close US ally - drew international outrage and criticism from US President Donald Trump. Hamas said six people were killed but that its leaders survived. When pressed on whether the US had any involvement in the strike, Netanyahu told journalists: \"We did it on our own. Period.\" The meeting between Rubio and Netanyahu comes as Arab leaders hold a summit in a show of support for Qatar. Its prime minister urged the international community to stop applying \"double standards\" and to punish Israel. In response to a question from the BBC about whether Israel's strike had damaged US relations in the region, Rubio said Washington maintained \"strong relationships with our Gulf allies\". Qatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel. CCTV captures moment of Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Doha On Sunday, Netanyahu told reporters that the US-Israel relationship was as \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\" while he and Rubio made a short visit to the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City. During the trip - on which they were accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee - Rubio wrote a note and placed it into the wall, a traditional ritual performed by visitors. The men ignored reporters' questions focusing on Israel's strikes in Qatar. Also thought to have been discussed by Netanyahu and Rubio are Israeli military plans to seize Gaza City and Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. Over the weekend, the Israeli military pressed ahead with the demolition of residential buildings in Gaza City, and - according to local media - is now poised to begin ground operations in the Western neighbourhoods of the city. It has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Some say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City. Netanyahu and Rubio's meeting comes ahead of a UN General Assembly session next week, at which some leading US allies - including the UK, France, Canada, Australia and Belgium - are expected to recognise the State of Palestine. This expected recognition has intensified debate within Israel around the future of the West Bank, with more hardline elements of the government insisting annexation is the only way to prevent a Palestinian state. In late August, the Israeli government gave final approval for the E1 settlement project east of Jerusalem, which would, in effect, split the West Bank in two - dividing the Palestinian populations in the north and south. Signing an agreement to press ahead with E1 last Thursday, Netanyahu said: \"We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.\" Earlier this month, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich unveiled his proposal for the annexation of approximately four-fifths of the West Bank. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them. The settlements are illegal under international law. On Monday evening, Rubio is set to visit the City of David archaeological park, which was established by a settler organisation in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem. He will attend the inauguration of the \"Pilgrimage Road\", a tunnel excavated underneath Palestinian homes that is said to mark the route of a Roman-era street taken by pilgrims to the Biblical temple that once stood on the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary). Critics say the City of David park is an attempt to politicise archaeology, at the expense of Palestinian residents.

Speaking to the Guardian while on a trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, he said: \"I don't believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.\" His comments came just days after a short meeting with his father , King Charles, their first meeting in over a year. It was the first time the pair had met since February 2024. The prince, who also appeared with his wife in the 2022 Netflix series Harry and Meghan, also spoke about his upcoming legal case against the Daily Mail's publisher, Associated Newspapers, at the High Court in London. He is suing them over allegations of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering along with Sir Elton John, Baroness Lawrence and other public figures. Associated Newspapers has denied claims that it hacked phones, calling them \"preposterous smears\". \"It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,\" said the Prince, who now lives in the US but returned to the UK last week to attend a series of events related to causes he supports. Underlining his \"love\" for the UK, he suggested he would like to return home to see his family more often. He added that for the coming year, \"the focus really has to be on my dad.\" Reuters Prince Harry laid a wreath in Maidan Square in the centre of Kyiv The aim of Prince Harry's visit to the Ukrainian capital was to promote the work of his Invictus Games Foundation and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of thousands of veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago. \"Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities,\" he said. \"It's about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.\" After having laid a wreath in memory of the dead, he described the conflict as \"all so unnecessary.\" His work for Invictus, he said, had helped to give him a renewed \"purpose\" after his military career ended, adding that it \"saved me\". He spoke to the British newspaper about the cost of war and how he boxes to relieve stress - punching a punch bag - as well as his portrayal in the media. He stressed that while he felt he had been \"destroyed by certain members of the British press\", he also still felt a lot of love from the British public. In January, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and apologised to him settle a long-running legal battle over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.

Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request. Outside of the UK you can watch on YouTube One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her. Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.

This year's big winners of the night were HBO's medical drama The Pitt, Apple TV+'s Hollywood satire The Studio and Netflix's chilling psychological miniseries Adolescence. Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series. The Late Show host Stephen Colbert pulled off a big win after his fellow nominees in the talk show category rallied behind him following his show's abrupt cancellation. And awards night host Nate Bargatze implored winners to keep their long-winded speeches snappy with a running gag that saw his charity donation docked if speech-givers went over their allotted time. Here's a look at this year's big moments from the ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Adolescence sweeps its category Getty Images Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne's drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder dominated the miniseries category with wins for best series and for stars Owen Cooper and supporting actress Erin Doherty. Cooper, 15, made Emmys history as the youngest supporting actor to win his category, and delivered a heart-warming acceptance speech after giving presenter Sydney Sweeney a shy hug. \"It means so much to me, my family, people back home. So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,\" Cooper said backstage after his win. Backstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would \"spark a bit of a conversation in the UK\" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success. The Studio wins big Getty Images The Studio actors Dewayne Perkins, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders, Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Bryan Cranston The Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season. Rogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's \"getting embarrassing\". Alas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech. Emmy Awards 2025: The winners and nominations in full Sydney Sweeney and Lisa from Blackpink walk Emmys red carpet Adolescence star Owen Cooper makes Emmys history The Pitt bests Severance Getty Images Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards It came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee. The Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win \"a dream\". \"I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,\" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama. Before that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show. Host Nate Bargatze keeps speeches in check with a cheque Getty Images Emmys host Nate Bargatze kept a running tally of donations to the Boys and Girls Club of North America throughout the show First-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over. \"It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea. The \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag. The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars. During a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's \"actually making money\". But with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9zep0y7reo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The British actress joked she would be \"banging on about Owen Cooper and Adolescence for the rest of my life\". \"I'd love to mention every single person involved in making this show because it was the definition of a team effort,\" she added. Getty Images Stephen Graham won best lead actor in a limited series, as well as a prize for co-writing the drama Accepting the prize for outstanding writing earlier in the night, Graham said: \"We never expected our little programme to have such a big impact, but we're really grateful that it did.\" His co-writer Jack Thorne paid tribute to the show's young cast, telling them: \"You are the flame that proved young people are going to be OK.\" Earlier in the weekend, actor Jake Gyllenhaal surprised Cooper during an interview, after the young actor previously described him as his hero. In a clip that went viral on social media, Gyllenhaal gave Cooper the \"lucky duck\" which had originally been given to him when he was nominated for an Oscar.

The Amazon show has been a breakout hit for young viewers and the tech giant is taking no chances of spoiling the story. For actress Corinna Brown, who plays Gemma, the secrecy began before she even auditioned. \"There were codenames galore,\" she remembers. \"There was a codename for the title of the show, there was a codename for my character. \"I thought up until maybe two days before we started shooting that my character was called Maeve. \"Amazon are very good at keeping it a secret.\" So keen are producers to prevent spoilers, BBC News is speaking to Brown under the condition she doesn't discuss the finale, which drops on Prime Video on Wednesday. Warning: The below may contain spoilers - especially if you haven't watched series three of the show Millions are gripped by the show's love triangle plot between Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, played by Lola Tung, and brothers Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher, played by Christopher Briney and Gavin Casalegno. Among the obsessions for fans have been a tiny engagement ring, a two-tier mirror glaze dark chocolate cake with raspberries and that sensual peach scene. Brown's character Gemma is one of Belly's new friends she meets after her move to Paris. So what was it like to be part of a cultural phenomenon? \"It was so exciting because it's so highly anticipated and everybody wants to know what's going to happen,\" London-born Brown, 26, says. \"The fan base are so passionate, which is something you don't always get.\" She says she \"didn't really realise\" how big the fandom of the show was until its release. \"So I think that was a good thing, to be fair, because otherwise, from the beginning, I would have been like: 'Oh my God'.\" 'We all love a bit of romance' As the show's Paris-era was unlocked, viewers have been introduced to a new supporting cast in Belly's circle in the French capital, including Gemma, who like Belly, is new to Paris. Brown describes her character as a \"kindred spirit\" to Belly. They meet outside a nightclub, when Gemma is being bothered by a man. Belly steps in to help her out and the two become friends. Brown says it is one of her favourite moments and shows \"women supporting each other\". Getty Images Gavin Casalegno, Lola Tung and Christopher Briney are the lead actors in the show According to Amazon, this season's first episode drew in 25 million global viewers, a 40% increase on the previous season, with Prime Video saying it is its most-watched TV season among women aged 18-34. Brown thinks the success of the show comes down to the writing by Jenny Han, who wrote the young adult (YA) romance books the TV series is based on. \"She knows what she's doing. She's got everybody hooked from the books,\" Brown says. \"It's lucky me to be a little part of that.\" Brown feels another reason why the show resonates is \"because we all go through it\". \"We go through friendship, heartache, love, confusion. For the audience that watch this show and love The Summer I Turned Pretty that is a big thing, it's a new thing, it forms so much of your life. \"Being able to watch someone's else experience of that is helpful... and we all love a bit of romance,\" she says. Beyond the traditional audience watching on screens, there are countless fan edits and reaction videos posted on social media, which Corinna says have been positive towards her character. \"They've been lovely. I've only seen good things. They say they like Gemma giving her [Belly] straight advice.\" Prime Video According to Amazon, this season's first episode drew in 25 million global viewers Already beloved by YA fans for her turn as Tara Jones in Netflix-hit Heartstopper, Brown is no stranger to the world of teen romance adaptations. \"With any show that's for a young audience, you have to have that awareness of the young minds that you're inspiring, shaping,\" Brown says. \"And that's an honour in itself.\" Amid all the buzz of the show, secrets are tightly guarded and with the finale about to drop we are not allowed to ask Brown what happens in it. But we can't help but ask what feels to fans like the summer's most pressing question: Are you team Conrad or team Jeremiah? \"I'm going to keep my lips tight on that one,\" Brown says, smiling. \"But what I will say is I am Team Gemma and Team Belly's friendship…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewnkld78qqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

The nights are drawing in, the tans are fading and we all need a bit of sparkle in our lives as we head into autumn. Never fear, Strictly Come Dancing is back with its 23rd series, with 15 new contestants ready to dust off their dancing shoes. Following last year's controversies relating to the behaviour of some professional dancers , plus a recently launched investigation into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars and an unnamed star being arrested on suspicion of rape (it is understood the development is not related to the upcoming series), BBC bosses will be keen for fans and media to return to talking about the show itself. With that in mind, the press gathered for an annual event which gives journalists a chance to speak to all the contestants ahead of the show launch (well, almost all, more on that later). Here's all the behind-the-scenes gossip we found out from the likes of Dani Dyer, Vicky Pattison and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. This year's Strictly contestants are glammed up and ready to go On being 'Strictified' One of the big attractions for most celebrity contestants on the show is the chance to glam up to the max every Saturday night. Former Love Island star Dani Dyer says she's game for any dance costume. \"I can't wait to be a bit sexy, I've been a mum... my oldest is four... am I sexy?,\" she giggles. \"On Love Island I never wore the thong bikinis and now I'm like 'Why didn't I do that?\" Dani in a carnival thong number for the samba? You heard it here first. La Voix says: \"The main reason we're doing this is it's like a free bootcamp!\" La Voix, who competed in the 2024 series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, arrives at the press event in full make-up with trademark coiffured hair-do. How on earth can you \"Strictify\" a drag performer? \"I might be the only one that dresses down on a live show! I want the full Strictly experience. They're going to take it to the next level. They have already – I've been lucky enough to have seen my first dress. \"The glamour is wonderful, I feel like I'm living my dream. I don't want to do the dancing, just the dressing up bit!\" Keeping control of the nerves Vicky Pattison first found fame on reality show Geordie Shore Former Geordie Shore star and podcast host Vicky Pattison has always been very open about her struggles with anxiety, recently revealing on her podcast Get A Grip that she had gone back to therapy to deal with Strictly nerves. \"Everyone's handling me with kid gloves at the moment, I keep getting loads of cuddles off everyone. \"I'm scared, a little bit overwhelmed. I think it's because I've wanted to do this show for so long, I'm a big fan. I'm desperate to make the most of it... but I'm worried I'll get in my own head.\" But support from the likes of former contestants Pete Wicks and her podcast co-host Angela Scanlon is helping. \"With Pete, our careers, there's a lot of parallels, we both come from reality TV and there's this common misconception that we're not very talented or capable of anything. I would really like to change that narrative. Pete just said be yourself. \"I just need to get a handle on myself and put my big girl pants on. I'll kick myself if I'm in my own head the whole time and I don't enjoy it. I think I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.\" Social media star George Clarke says the nerves haven't hit him - yet. \"I don't really get nervous until it's just about to happen, which is nice, until it's just about to happen! Nice build-up and then a breakdown in the dressing room!\" Model, actress and influencer Ellie Goldstein says she's \"excited and nervous but nerves are good. I'm so competitive, I want to win!\" And Dani's famous dad Danny Dyer will be cheering her on. \"Dad is so excited for me, he loves the show. He came to support when Rose Ayling Ellis (his on-screen daughter in EastEnders) was doing it and it was emotional then. He loves a dance himself. I should get him up!\" The Strictly curse PA Media Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink played for teams such as Chelsea and Leeds and the Netherlands national team and has managed clubs including QPR and Northampton Town None of the contestants seemed bothered about the so-called Strictly curse, which refers to several former contestants who were already in…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r4j2elldo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",

A 20-minute drive away, the clinic was in Shesh Pol village in Afghanistan's north-eastern Badakhshan province. It was where their two older children were born. Abdul sat next to Shahnaz comforting her as they drove over gravel tracks to reach help. \"But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed. I didn't know it had shut down,\" he said, his face crumpling with agony. Warning: Readers may find some details in this article distressing. The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID). A single-storey structure with four small rooms, white paint peeling off its walls, the Shesh Pol clinic has USAID posters tacked up everywhere with information and guidance for pregnant women and new mothers. Aakriti Thapar / BBC Shesh Pol maternity clinic is one of hundreds of medical facilities forced to close as a result of US aid cuts in Afghanistan It doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider programme implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths. It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month. It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services. Other medical facilities are simply too far from Abdul's village, and it was not without risk for Shahnaz to travel on bumpy roads. Abdul also didn't have money to pay for a longer journey - renting the taxi cost 1,000 Afghani ($14.65; £12.70), roughly a quarter of his monthly income as a labourer. So they decided to return home. \"But the baby was coming and we had to stop by the side of the road,\" Abdul said. Shahnaz delivered their baby girl in the car. Shortly after, she died, bleeding profusely. A few hours later, before she could be named, their baby also died. Aakriti Thapar / BBC Abdul spoke to the BBC about the traumatic deaths of his wife and newborn baby, who are buried in Shesh Pol \"I wept and screamed. My wife and child could've been saved if the clinic was open,\" said Abdul. \"We had a hard life, but we were living it together. I was always happy when I was with her.\" He doesn't even have a photo of Shahnaz to hold on to. There's no certainty the mother and baby would've survived if they'd been treated at the clinic, but without it, they didn't stand a chance, underlining the undeniable impact of US aid cuts in Afghanistan. For decades, America has been the largest donor to Afghanistan, and in 2024, US funds made up a staggering 43% of all aid coming into the country. The Trump administration has justified withdrawing it, saying there were \"credible and longstanding concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including... the Taliban\", who govern the country. The US government further added that they had reports stating that at least $11m were \"being siphoned or enriching the Taliban\". The report that the US State Department referenced was made by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). It said that $10.9m of US taxpayer money had been paid to the Taliban-controlled government by partners of USAID in \"taxes, fees, duties, or utilities\". The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands. \"This allegation is not true. The aid is given to the UN, and through them to NGOs in provinces. They identify who needs the aid, and they distribute it themselves. The government is not involved,\" said Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha. BBC visits closed down US-backed clinic in Afghanistan after aid cuts The Taliban government's policies, especially its restrictions on women, the harshest in the world, have meant that after four years in power, it is still not recognised by most of the world. It's also a key reason donors have been increasingly walking away from the country. The US insists no one has died because of aid cuts. Shahnaz and her baby's deaths are not recorded anywhere. Neither are countless others. The BBC has documented at least half a dozen first-hand, devastating accounts…</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgqdneev1no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>",
