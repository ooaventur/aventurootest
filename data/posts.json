That suggests the buyers are not rushing to the exit as they anticipate a move toward the all-time high of $124,474.</p>\n<p>BTC researcher Axel Adler Jr. said in a post on X that the “market is neither overheated nor oversold” at the current level. That could result in one to two weeks of consolidation before <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-70percent-chance-of-hitting-new-highs-in-2-weeks-analyst\" title=\"null\">BTC rises to a new all-time high</a>.</p>\n<p>Several analysts expect BTC to hit a new all-time high. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said in an interview that the rally could peak quickly after making a new high. Once the top is in, Cowen does not rule out <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drawdown-bear-market-buying-dip-benjamin-cowen\" title=\"null\">a 70% fall in the next bear market</a>.</p>\n<p>Could BTC break out of its overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>BTC pierced the $117,500 overhead resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($114,457) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $117,500 opens the gates for a rally to $124,474.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this assumption, a break below the 20-day EMA signals that the bulls are closing their positions in a hurry. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $110,000, remaining inside the $107,000 to $117,500 range for a while longer.</p>\n<h2>Ether price prediction</h2>\n<p>Ether (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" title=\"null\">ETH</a>) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>If the price turns down and breaks below the support line, it signals that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $4,060 and, after that, to the pattern target of $3,426.</p>\n<p>Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat if they kick the price above the resistance line. That improves the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The Ether price could then rally toward the pattern target of $5,586.</p>\n<h2>XRP price prediction</h2>\n<p>XRP (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" title=\"null\">XRP</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.99) on Tuesday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead barrier at $3.20.</p>\n<p>The bears are striving to pull the price below the moving averages to seize control. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could descend toward the strong support at $2.73. Such a move suggests the breakout above the downtrend line was a bull trap. A close below $2.69 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a fall to $2.20.</p>\n<p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $3.20 to signal a short-term trend change. The XRP price may then ascend to $3.40 and eventually to $3.66. </p>\n<h2>BNB price prediction</h2>\n<p>BNB (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" title=\"null\">BNB</a>) jumped over the psychological level of $1,000 on Thursday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. </p>\n<p>The bears will try to defend the $1,000 level, but if the buyers prevail, the BNB/USDT pair could extend the rally to $1,090.</p>\n<p>The 20-day EMA ($915) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.</p>\n<p>Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The BNB price may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($855).</p>\n<h2>Solana price prediction</h2>\n<p>Solana (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\" title=\"null\">SOL</a>) turned down from $253 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the $260 level.</p>\n<p>The pullback is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $260. If they manage to pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $295.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are booking profits. That could pull the Solana price to the uptrend line, which is likely to attract buyers.</p>\n<h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>Dogecoin (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\" title=\"null\">DOGE</a>) turned up from the $0.26 level on Tuesday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance from the bears at $0.29.</p>\n<p>If the price rebounds off the $0.26 level again, it shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That increases the likelihood of a break above $0.31.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.</strong></p><p>Grab a coffee because the year’s final stretch is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin (BTC). With the Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning what looks like its rate-cutting cycle, analysts believe the pioneer crypto could be setting up for a record-breaking run.</p><h2>Crypto News of the Day: Analysts Eye $145,000 Bitcoin by December as Liquidity Shifts After Fed Cuts</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin bulls are finding fresh momentum after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">Fed’s September rate cut</a>, with analysts now projecting a potential year-end rally toward record highs.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">liquidity dynamics shifting</a> and institutional flows accelerating, some analysts believe Bitcoin could end 2025 near the $145,000 mark.</p><p>John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer, told BeInCrypto he expects a sharp move higher as investors reposition for a weaker dollar.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m forecasting a BTC price of circa $140,000 to $145,000 by year’s end. The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation,” Glover said.</p></blockquote><p>This forecast suggests a growing conviction that the Fed’s policy pivot will funnel capital into non-yielding, alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>With real interest rates under pressure, digital assets are increasingly framed as macro hedges and liquidity beneficiaries. Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, echoed the bullish tone.</p><blockquote><p>“With the Fed cutting 25 bps and its projections indicating two additional cuts by December, the macro backdrop turns more supportive for Bitcoin into year-end,” Kennis told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>However, the Nansen executive articulated that the Fed’s path is not the only driver. In his opinion, end-of-year levels hinge more on real rates, dollar strength, liquidity, and broader market dynamics.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>Kennis highlighted that lower policy rates reduce the opportunity cost of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps\">holding Bitcoin</a> and can ease financial conditions.</p><p>If real yields drift lower and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf\">Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds)</a> inflows persist, he believes the “path of least resistance is higher.”</p><p>Still, Nansen’s Kennis warned that recessionary cuts could weigh on broader risk assets, potentially tempering crypto upside.</p><h2>Institutional Flows and Options Markets Signal Growing Confidence in Bitcoin</h2><p>Institutional participation also marks a major shift from previous cycles. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf\">US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, alongside the rise of digital asset treasuries (DATs), reported in a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, have simplified allocations for funds, pensions, and corporates.</p><p>If the SEC finalizes a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">generic listing framework for spot digital-asset ETFs</a>, as reports suggest, product breadth could expand further, accelerating mainstream adoption.</p><p>Markets appear to be adjusting in real time. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Bitcoin has held above $115,000 in the post-FOMC rally</a>, with Glassnode data showing 95% of supply now in profit.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Options markets also reflect the bullish tilt</a>. Open interest has surged toward record levels ahead of next week’s massive September 26 expiry, where $18 billion in notional contracts come due.</p><p>While skeptics caution that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> spikes and profit-taking remain likely, the narrative of rate cuts fueling Bitcoin as a macro hedge is gaining ground.</p><p>If Glover’s and Kennis’ projections hold, Bitcoin could run 24% above current levels by year-end and realize the $145,000 target.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZNJaovz9/\">TradingView</a></p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/binance-cz-trust-wallet-token-twt-utility-roadmap/\">Binance founder CZ sparks 25% Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>rally after utility roadmap reveal.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\">Bitcoin may drop to $105,000</a>if it loses this level.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Over $4.3 billion Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum options expire today</a>–<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">Volatility</a>ahead for BTC and ETH?</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/upbit-lists-four-altcoins-ethfi-resolv-init-spk/\">Upbit expands market</a>with four new altcoin listings.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cathie-wood-backs-300m-solana-deal-on-italian-soccer-team-owner/\">Cathie Wood backs $300 million Solana deal</a>on Italian soccer team owner.</li><li>This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cardano-traders-should-prepare-for-liquidations/\">Cardano traders should prepare for $73 million liquidations</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\">Bitcoin price hints at a 2% dip</a>before resuming $120,000+ journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-launch-breaks-records-but-price-lags/\">XRP ETF launch breaks records</a>, but price lags behind market rally.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/kalshi-overtakes-polymarket-nfl-season-prediction-market/\">Kalshi overtakes Polymarket</a>as NFL season fuels $500 million prediction market surge.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/paypal-usd-stellar-xlm-price/\">PayPal USD officially launches on Stellar</a>– What does this mean for XLM price?</li></ul><h2>Crypto Equities Pre-Market Overview</h2><table><row span=\"3\"><cell><i>Company</i></cell><cell><i>At the Close of September 18</i></cell><cell><i>Pre-Market Overview</i></cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Strategy (MSTR)</cell><cell>$349.12</cell><cell>$348.44 (-0.19%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Coinbase (COIN)</cell><cell>$343.13</cell><cell>$341.00 (-0.62%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)</cell><cell>$33.08</cell><cell>$32.70 (-1.15%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>MARA Holdings (MARA)</cell><cell>$18.50</cell><cell>$18.34 (-0.86%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Riot Platforms (RIOT)</cell><cell>$17.51</cell><cell>$17.39 (-0.71%)</cell></row><row><cell>Core Scientific (CORZ)</cell><cell>$16.75</cell><cell>$16.90 (+0.90%)</cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cuts-bitcoin-145000-us-crypto-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm warns that a failure to do so could lead to a drop to $105,500.</p><h2>Record Options Expiration Looms</h2><p>Glassnode’s data shows that fears of a major price decline have lessened since the Fed’s announcement. While the spot market showed some minor selling pressure, risk-off positions in the derivatives market noticeably increased.</p>Sponsored<p>Open interest in the perpetuals market has slightly decreased. Glassnode noted that open interest, which had peaked at 3.95 million BTC, has now dropped to 3.78 million BTC. An analysis of liquidation data shows that while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/high-spread-between-bitcoin-derivatives-and-spot/\">short positions were squeezed</a> just before the rate announcement, the proportion of long position liquidations increased after the rate cut.</p><p>The potential for major <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> remains, however, as the open interest in the options market has hit a record high of 5 million BTC. A record amount of these options are set to expire next Friday, on September 26.</p><h2>Drop Below $115,200 Could Break Momentum</h2><p>Glassnode suggests paying close attention to the Bitcoin options’ “max pain” price. With both a price increase and decrease on the table, a large-scale liquidation event on either side could have a significant impact on the spot price.</p><p>The current <a href=\"https://%244.3%20Billion%20Bitcoin%20&amp;%20Ethereum%20Options%20Expire%20Today%20%20BeInCrypto%20https://beincrypto.com%20%E2%80%BA%20bitcoin-ethereum-options-expi...\">max pain</a> price for long positions is $112,700, while for short positions it’s $121,600. As of this article’s writing, Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating around $116,990.</p><p>Most of the Bitcoin traded on-chain since the September FOMC has been above $115,200. Glassnode states that maintaining this price level is key to preserving momentum, while losing it risks a drop to $105,500.</p><p>Ultimately, staying above $115,200 would maintain demand-driven momentum, while a drop below that level risks a retraction into the $105,500 to $115,200 range. Glassnode concludes that a comprehensive look at the on-chain signals suggests that market participants may be in a state of waiting for Bitcoin’s direction to be decided.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At press time, it was trading near $117,100, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The breakout from a head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10 still points higher, with a first target of $120,800.</strong></p><p>But not everything is smooth. Two on-chain red flags, selling from large balance groups and younger coin holders, hint at a possible 2% correction before the rally resumes.</p><h2>Selling Pressure Builds From Large Balance Groups</h2>Sponsored<p>Two of Bitcoin’s biggest wallet groups have trimmed their holdings since September 15. These groups are often referred to as “whales” and “sharks” — wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC and 10,000–100,000 BTC, respectively.</p><ul><li>The 1,000–10,000 BTC group dropped their holdings from 4.35 million BTC to 4.33 million BTC.</li><li>The 10,000–100,000 BTC group fell from 2.17 million BTC to 2.16 million BTC.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://app.santiment.net/charts/BK58RjBT__sCl\">Santiment</a></p><p>That’s a net outflow of about 30,000 BTC in just four days. With today’s <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin price</a> above $117,000, nearly $3.5 billion worth of BTC has been trimmed from holdings.</p><p><strong>Want more token insights like this? </strong>Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter <a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\">here</a>.</p><p>Such drops often signal that large investors are booking profits or preparing for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a>.</p><h2>Younger Coins Show Fresh Selling</h2><p>Another key on-chain signal confirms the picture: Spent Output Age Bands. This metric shows what percentage of coins from different “age groups” are being moved or sold. In other words, it tracks how much of the supply last moved weeks or months ago is now being spent again.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, every younger age cohort has increased its share of spent coins:</p><ul><li>1 week to 1 month holders: rose from 8.72% to 9.78%.</li><li>1 to 3 month holders: rose from 3.67% to 6.08%.</li><li>3 to 6 month holders: rose from 2.04% to 3.26%.</li><li>6 to 12 month holders: rose from 1.64% to 3.18%. (relatively younger considering BTC’s history)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/indicators.Soab?a=BTC&amp;mScl=lin&amp;s=1757047420&amp;u=1758257020&amp;zoom=14\">Glassnode</a></p><p>These cohorts are considered “younger” because they bought or moved their coins within the last year. Unlike long-term holders who keep Bitcoin for multiple years, younger holders are quicker to sell into Bitcoin price rallies.</p><p>The rise across all four bands means more short- to mid-term holders might be cashing out. This aligns with the selling already visible from the big balance groups, forming a clear picture of near-term supply pressure.</p><h2>Bitcoin Price Chart Still Points Higher, But With Risks</h2>Sponsored<p>Despite the selling signs, the broader technical setup remains bullish. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-flag-breakout-hurdle/\">Bitcoin broke above</a> an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10, and the breakout level has held since then. As long as the Bitcoin price stays above $114,900, the immediate upside target remains at $120,800.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HEOJm180/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\">TradingView</a></p><p>However, a dip toward $114,900 looks more realistic in the short term, as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> data has flashed another risk. Between August 22 and September 18, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-grip-weakens-heres-why/\">Bitcoin’s price </a>formed lower highs while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> made higher highs. </p><p>This hidden bearish divergence often signals that momentum is slowing, leaving room for a brief 2% pullback (the immediate and strongest support level).</p><p>Yet, if the Bitcoin price dips under $114,900, the pullback could stretch further toward $110,000. A daily close under that level would weaken the bullish structure.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a notional value of $3.5 billion and a total open interest of 30,208.</p><p>With a Put-to-Call ratio 1.23, the maximum pain level for today’s expiring Bitcoin options is $114,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>For their Ethereum counterparts, the notional value for today’s expiring ETH options is $806.75 million, with total open interest of 177,398.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, however, today’s expiring Ethereum options have a Put-to-Call Ratio (PCR) below 1, with Deribit data showing 0.99 as of this writing. Meanwhile, the maximum pain level, or strike price, is $4,500.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/ETH/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>The maximum pain point is a crucial metric in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/\">crypto options trading</a>. It represents the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless. This scenario inflicts the maximum financial loss, or “pain,” on traders holding these options. </p><p>Notably, today’s expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum options are <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-4-billion/\">slightly higher than last week’s</a>. On September 12, BeInCrypto reported nearly $4.3 billion expiring options, highlighting 29,651 BTC and 189,700 ETH contracts, with notional values of $3.42 billion and $858.2 million, respectively.</p><p>However, the main difference between this week’s expiring options and those seen last week is that this time, Ethereum expiring options have a PCR below 1.</p><p>A PCR below 1 indicates that more Call (Purchase) options are traded than Put (Sale) options. Therefore, this suggests a bullish market sentiment for Ethereum, and bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, which has more Puts than Calls.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s PCR at 1.23 and Ethereum’s at 0.99 suggest an almost balanced bet among traders between sale and purchase orders.</p><p>This balanced outlook comes as investors speculate whether the market will move higher or are hedging their portfolios in case of a sell-off.</p><h2>Options Market Signals Caution After Fed Cut as Record Expiry Looms</h2>Sponsored<p>In hindsight, it is worth noting that options had repriced ahead of the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With this, implied <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> for options contracts rose while trading volume declined, suggesting market caution.</p><blockquote><p>“Options are repricing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting, with implied</p><a href=\"\">volatility</a>on options expiring tomorrow rising significantly. Recent actual<a href=\"\">volatility</a>has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead,” analysts at Greeks.live had<a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote><p>Glassnode highlights a post-rate-cut patience in the market, with Bitcoin trading above 115,200 and 95% of supply in profit after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">FOMC rally</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“</p><a href=\"\">Futures</a>show short squeezes, and options open interest hit a record 500,000 BTC ahead of the September 26 expiry. Holding above 115,200 is key while a drop risks a move back toward 105,500,”<a href=\"\">wrote</a>Glassnode analysts.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that next Friday, September 26, the largest weekly Bitcoin options expiry in history will be seen. On that day, over $18 billion in notional value will expire.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>At the $118,000 Bitcoin price level, over $2.4 billion is in the money, with a maximum pain of $110,000. The Put open interest is minimal until $110,000.</p><p>Therefore, next week could be interesting. The margin usually drives short-term price action, so markets should not be surprised to see a flush despite the sentiment.</p><p>In the meantime, however, traders should brace for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> because the max pain concept often influences market behavior.</p><p>According to the Max Pain theory, the asset’s price tends to gravitate toward this level as options near expiration.</p><p>As the options near their expiry time, 8:00 UTC on Deribit, the Bitcoin price, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">trading for $117,147 as of this writing</a>, could pull toward its max pain at $114,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which was <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/\">trading for $4,590</a>, could drop toward $4,500.</p><p>Nevertheless, markets usually stabilize soon after traders adapt to the new price environment. With today’s high-volume expiration, traders and investors can expect a similar outcome, potentially influencing market trends into the weekend.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One to six individuals can come together to form an SMSF.</p>\n<p>SMSFs are largely unique to Australia.

These investors plan to allocate an average of $67,000 to cryptocurrency, indicating a growing mainstream interest in digital assets for retirement portfolios.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OKX took the lead by launching its SMSF product in June 2025, and the demand has exceeded expectations. OKX’s advantage lies in its simplified approach, providing not only crypto access but also connecting clients with accountants and legal advisers to facilitate SMSF setup and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-okx-crypto-australia-retirement-system\">compliance</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts highlight how global exchanges are tailoring their strategies to Australia’s distinctive retirement savings market, where the scale and regulatory environment position SMSFs as a key entry point for cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/36d86b39596f23c8ae34451b82f50db2.jpg\" title=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\"></p>\n<h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Multiple catalysts behind the move of Coinbase and OKX            </h2>\n<p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                </p>\n<p><em>The efforts of Coinbase and OKX to enter Australia’s SMSFs are fueled by local demand and global policy changes.

Globally, policy developments are lending credibility to this trend. For example, a US executive order allowing cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) retirement plans indicates that digital assets are becoming part of mainstream retirement strategies.</p>\n<p>This global context strengthens confidence among Australian investors and regulators. Together, these factors explain why exchanges like Coinbase and OKX view SMSFs as a key opportunity for incorporating cryptocurrency into long-term savings.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Did you know?</strong> In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing in February 2021, Tesla declared that it had bought <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">$1.5 billion</a> worth of BTC.

Stablecoin opposers point to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-risk-crypto-transactions-bitrace-2024-report\" title=\"null\">transfers of illicit funds</a>. Proponents argue that the transparent nature of blockchains <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debunking-the-myth-cryptocurrency-is-used-for-criminal-activity\" title=\"null\">can be used to detect such crimes</a>. </p><p>There is a lack of awareness of how a deep integration of stablecoins in global finance can drive the use of blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency to fight financial crimes, even in traditional finance.</p><h2>The stablecoin story</h2><p>The stablecoin industry is going from strength to strength, aided by increased regulatory clarity and meaningful use cases. The ability to facilitate swifter, more cost-effective transactions than traditional banking rails has accelerated their adoption worldwide. The total value in circulation is <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-surpasses-200-b-as-usdc-dominance-rises\" title=\"null\">estimated to be north of $200 billion</a>.<br></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-08/019864ed-c95d-78ba-83be-6bb720d761b7\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>Average supply of stablecoins in circulation, across all stablecoins. Source: World Economic Forum.</em></figcaption></figure><p>We now have a host of <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/genius-stablecoin-bill-opens-door-for-big-tech-stablecoin/\" title=\"null\">tech</a> firms, <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-amazon-explore-stablecoins-payments\" title=\"null\">retail</a> giants and traditional financial institutions lining up to issue their own stablecoins. The payment economy might be on a metaphorical spiral staircase that runs back to pre-Civil War times. Back then, the US had hundreds of local banks, each issuing their own private currency to be used as legal tender. Despite being a part of everyday payments, those currencies were not accepted too far away from the issuing bank. In hindsight, this probably kept an unintended check on any attempt to obfuscate the money trail.</p><h2>Tracking illicit finance</h2><p>In contrast, with thriving crosschain interoperability, it can be safely assumed that users will not have to jump through hoops to convert one stablecoin to another or any other digital asset or off-ramp them to fiat. This vision of the near future, marked by unabated and instantaneous capital flows across jurisdictions, naturally translates to stringent regulations to address illicit finance. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\"><em><strong>Real-time crypto laundering exposes CEX vulnerabilities — Report</strong></em></a></p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-legitimizes-stablecoins-institutional-adoption\" title=\"null\">Regulatory</a> guardrails for stablecoins mandate adherence to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Surprisingly, the prowess of stablecoins themselves, to beef up law enforcement’s fight against financial crime, is not yet a part of the crypto zeitgeist. </p><p>Stablecoins flowing across the globe on immutable, transparent, public blockchains add teeth to the global fight against illicit finance by providing traceability in international finance with a much-needed leg up.</p><h2>The old world</h2><p>The archaic structure of traditional finance severely handicaps counter-crime initiatives. This is primarily because each bank or financial institution is a walled garden, a closed ecosystem in which the central authority controls all accesses, processes and user experiences. </p><p>Compliance professionals at each such financial institution can only investigate financial activity that transpired strictly within the virtual walls of the organization. This is a sliver of any entity’s entire set of commercial dealings, as any firm or person typically engages with multiple financial institutions. </p><p>Any walled garden hosts only a partial picture of their customers. </p><p>Suspicious Activity Reports filed by each bank are based on an incomplete picture of their customers, potentially causing misreporting of risk levels. Additionally, this outdated predicament causes significant inefficiency for law enforcement agencies, as they must separately obtain access to records from each financial institution that the entity under investigation might have touched and then proceed to painstakingly stitch together the complete picture.</p><h2>The new world</h2><p>A world with agile, international capital flows on stablecoin rails will enable law enforcement to study suspicious patterns using unfragmented, reliable and transparent information gathered directly from blockchains. Tracing across jurisdictions will not entail navigating red tape.</p><p><br>On a more thought-provoking note, a robust stablecoin payment economy will induce routine capital flows from traditional finance organizations to blockchains and vice versa. </p><p>Proceeds from real-world offenses, such as human trafficking, drug peddling and violent crimes, and crypto crimes, such as decentralized finance hacks, ransomware and crypto scams, might be laundered across a combination of traditional finance and crypto products. </p><p>Using live data from blockchains in AML initiatives can provide prompt intelligence even on criminal organizations that primarily use banks to place the spoils of their crimes.</p><p>Case in point, in recent times, the financial crime of sanctions evasion has <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ruble-stablecoin-a7a5-grinex-link-garantex-ft\" title=\"null\">exhibited such patterns</a>, with sanctioned funds flowing interchangeably across both banking and stablecoin rails in an attempt to launder the same and dodge sanctions. </p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The emergence of a pervasive stablecoin infrastructure will do wonders to showcase to the global compliance community how the ubiquitous transparency of public blockchains enables lightning-fast, sophisticated responses toward preventing and detecting illicit finance.</p><p>This can spur much-needed cooperation between anti-crime divisions within traditional finance and crypto, with each sharing relevant intelligence for cross-pollination.</p><p>Custodians of conventional financial products have not yet recognized that metaphorical bread crumbs strewn across blockchains can be used as well-founded signals to infer user intent. A stablecoin industry, deeply integrated with the global banking system, will influence the use of these assets to make the universal financial network safer.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Debanjan Chatterjee, financial analyst.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at the Chartered Professional Accountants conference in Ottawa, Morrow called for clear <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/senate-advances-genius-act-to-create-first-u-s-stablecoin-regulations\">regulations</a> to guide stablecoin usage. He stressed that as the digital asset market grows, Canadian regulators must act swiftly to maintain stability and security.</p>\n    <h2>Clear Rules Needed as Stablecoins Surge</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/jpmorgan-new-stablecoins-set-to-compete-with-circles-usdc-in-us-market/\">Stablecoins</a> have seen rapid growth in recent years, now handling transactions worth $1 trillion annually. <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/09/making-change-accelerating-payments-innovation/\">Morrow emphasized</a> that stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are more reliable for everyday use. He noted that their value is tied to stable assets, such as national currencies, which reduces price instability.</p>\n    <p>Morrow pointed out that while cross-border payments are vital, they must also be secure and efficient. He explained that these digital currencies could help lower transaction costs and speed up international transfers. However, for them to be trusted as real money, Morrow stated, they need clear and consistent regulations.</p>\n    <p>He called on federal and provincial regulators to cooperate on creating comprehensive rules for stablecoins. As interest in these digital assets grows, Canada must align its approach with global standards.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins must be as safe and stable as the funds people hold in their bank accounts,” Morrow added.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Bank of Canada’s Approach to Payments Innovation</h2>\n    <p>Canada’s payment system has faced criticism for lagging behind global counterparts. Many argue that Canada’s banking infrastructure is slow, costly, and lacks competition. Morrow acknowledged these issues and stressed that Canada must modernize its payment system to stay competitive.</p>\n    <p>The Bank of Canada has explored digital currency options in the past. In 2022, it partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate a central bank digital currency. However, by September 2024, the Bank decided to focus on a real-time payment system for instant transfers.</p>\n    <p>Morrow indicated that the country’s slow pace in adopting new technologies must change. He urged the Canadian government and regulators to use the current momentum to drive innovation. Modernizing Canada’s payment system is essential to providing Canadians with faster, cheaper, and more secure services.</p>\n    <h2>Global Stablecoin Regulation and Canada’s Role</h2>\n    <p>The rise of stablecoins has been supported by clearer regulations in the United States. The recent <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/genius-act-loophole-risks-draining-small-banks-senator-warns/\">GENIUS Act</a> in the U.S. has provided more certainty to the market, encouraging wider adoption. Morrow believes Canada must take similar steps to ensure stablecoins are safely integrated into the country’s financial system.</p>\n    <p>With the rapid growth of digital assets worldwide, Morrow warned that Canada risks falling behind. He highlighted the need for regulations that foster innovation while ensuring security. The Bank of Canada’s role in shaping the future of stablecoins will be crucial as global payment systems continue to evolve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/bank-of-canada-calls-for-stablecoin-regulations-amid-global-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While XRP celebrates its groundbreaking ETF launch and Cardano pushes forward with massive healthcare investments, both communities are experiencing something remarkable—yet incomplete.</p>\n    <p>These institutional wins represent genuine progress, but they also highlight the persistent technical barriers that prevent true blockchain revolution. The Layer Brett presale, <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">having raised over $3.78 million</a>, offers something entirely different: a community-driven escape from these limitations through revolutionary Layer 2 technology that transforms passive crypto holding into active participation.</p>\n    <h2>The hidden scalability crisis: Why XRP’s ETF success and Cardano’s $200M healthcare investment can’t fix core blockchain bottlenecks</h2>\n    <p>XRP’s recent institutional momentum tells an incredible story. The first U.S. XRP ETF launched in September, followed by CME adding futures options in October. This institutional embrace signals mainstream acceptance that XRP believers have championed for years. However, beneath this celebration lies an uncomfortable truth: institutional adoption doesn’t solve the fundamental throughput issues that limit real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>Cardano faces similar challenges despite Charles Hoskinson’s ambitious $200 million healthcare initiative in Wyoming. While ADA maintains resilience around $0.87 with surging trading volumes, the project still grapples with the same scalability constraints that have plagued blockchain networks since inception.</p>\n    <p>Both communities deserve better than watching institutional money validate their investments while the underlying technology remains constrained. The question becomes: what happens when institutional demand meets infrastructure limitations?</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett’s community-driven solution: How our Layer 2 technology delivers what XRP and ADA promise but can’t execute</h2>\n    <p>This is where the Layer Brett movement becomes revolutionary. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett delivers the speed and cost efficiency that XRP and Cardano communities have been waiting for. While traditional networks process transactions in seconds or minutes, Layer Brett operates at lightning speed with minimal gas fees—solving the exact problems that limit mainstream adoption.</p>\n    <p>The difference lies in approach. XRP and ADA built their solutions as monolithic networks, inheriting the scalability challenges that come with that architecture. Layer Brett leverages proven Layer 2 technology, creating a foundation that scales naturally with demand.</p>\n    <p>What makes this truly special is the community-first mentality driving development. Unlike corporate-controlled projects that prioritize institutional partnerships over user experience, Layer Brett emerges from genuine grassroots enthusiasm. The project combines meme culture energy with serious technical innovation, creating something that feels both accessible and revolutionary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett’s 675% staking rewards create true community wealth</h2>\n    <p>Traditional crypto investing often feels passive—buy tokens, watch prices, hope for institutional validation. Layer Brett transforms this experience through active participation that generates real returns. The over 675% staking APY represents more than impressive numbers; it demonstrates how community-driven projects can redistribute wealth directly to supporters rather than institutional intermediaries.</p>\n    <p>Consider the viral potential: meme culture combined with legitimate utility creates unprecedented sharing incentives. XRP and Cardano supporters promote their investments hoping for price appreciation. Layer Brett community members share something more compelling—a project that rewards participation immediately while building toward long-term revolution.</p>\n    <h2>Join the Brett revolution: How our meme-powered Layer 2 ecosystem transforms you from crypto spectator to blockchain pioneer</h2>\n    <p>The opportunity window remains open, but momentum builds daily. <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">At $0.0058 per token</a>, early supporters can access genuine Layer 2 innovation before mainstream discovery drives prices higher. This isn’t about following institutional lead—it’s about joining a movement that prioritizes community empowerment over corporate profit.</p>\n    <p>The comparison becomes clear: XRP and Cardano offer institutional validation and steady development progress. Layer Brett offers immediate participation in blockchain’s next evolution. While others celebrate external recognition, the Layer Brett community builds internal value through revolutionary technology and authentic collaboration.</p>\n    <h6>Connect your wallet and buy in today.</h6>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com\">https://layerbrett.com</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">https://t.me/layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">(1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n    <h2>The Commodity Class Is Law</h2>\n    <p>In a market clouded by uncertainty, one truth has already been established: Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies belong to the commodity class.<br/>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts have ruled repeatedly that Bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC v. McDonnell (2018) decision and CME’s regulated Bitcoin futures contracts leave no doubt — Bitcoin trades under the same legal framework as gold, oil, or wheat.<br/>In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reinforced that status by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The commodity class isn’t theory — it’s defined law.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.getmidnight.com/13448471d89a9cd8d7f71026a0334ec8/2025/09/POW.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>The Golden Lineage of Proof-of-Work</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin was the genesis: digital gold with no issuer, no premine, no promises. But the lineage didn’t stop there. Other proof-of-work assets carried forward the same DNA: decentralization, fair mining, and issuance without corporate control.<br/>This is the Golden Lineage — assets that regulators and markets consistently treat as commodities, not securities. And critically, there are only four Proof-of-Work coins launched before 2015 that fully hold to what many call the King’s Law: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin. These are the foundation stones of the commodity class.</p>\n    <h2>Litecoin: The Silver Signal</h2>\n    <p>If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. With faster block times and over a decade of survival, Litecoin has proven itself as a foundational proof-of-work asset.<br/>Now, it has stepped into Bitcoin’s regulatory shadow. In 2025, major exchanges filed for spot Litecoin ETFs, explicitly building on Bitcoin’s commodity precedent. This marks Litecoin as the signal — proof that the commodity class is expanding beyond BTC.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin: The Cultural Commodity</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin adds another branch to the lineage. Born as a meme, it evolved into one of the most mined and most traded proof-of-work assets. No premine, no ICO, and a global community have ensured its survival.<br/>Dogecoin demonstrates that even culture-driven coins can achieve commodity status when they are decentralized, mined fairly, and operate without an issuer.</p>\n    <h2>Vertcoin: The Overlooked Heir</h2>\n    <p>This brings us to the hidden gem in Bitcoin’s lineage: <a href=\"https://vertcoin.org\">Vertcoin (VTC)</a>.<br/>Launched in 2014 with no ICO, no premine, and no centralized control, Vertcoin was designed for one mission: true decentralization. Unlike most networks, it remains ASIC-resistant, keeping mining accessible to everyday participants and aligned with Satoshi’s vision of a people-powered network.<br/>By structure, Vertcoin belongs to the same commodity class as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin:<br/>- Proof-of-Work secured<br/>- Decentralized, no issuer promises<br/>- Fair distribution, no premine or ICO<br/>- Recognized trading markets, fungible and uniform<br/>Yet unlike BTC, LTC, and DOGE, Vertcoin trades far below the spotlight. That gap between commodity-class certainty and market recognition is what makes it the golden opportunity.</p>\n    <h2>The Family Tree Is Written — The Advantage Is Hidden</h2>\n    <p>- Bitcoin: defined as a commodity by law and futures markets.<br/>- Litecoin: signaling commodity expansion through ETF filings.<br/>- Dogecoin: the cultural commodity with scale and community.<br/>- Vertcoin: the overlooked heir, built on the same DNA, still waiting for recognition.<br/>Certainty is rare in crypto — Bitcoin and Litecoin have it. Dogecoin proved it culturally. Vertcoin, the fourth member of the pre-2015 lineage that holds the King’s Law, won’t stay hidden forever.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-defined-it-litecoin-etfs-validate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Traditional capitalism is experiencing a profound transformation, one that is redefining the very fabric of global financial systems. At the forefront of this seismic shift is cryptocurrency—a decentralized, borderless, and permissionless paradigm that operates beyond the control of traditional banking infrastructures and central governments. Cryptocurrencies are not just digital assets anymore; they have evolved into foundational elements of an emerging economic order that many are calling <i>Capitalism 2.0</i>.</p>\n<p>This new financial architecture is driven by an ethos of open-source collaboration, decentralized governance, and blockchain-based transparency. Central banks are being challenged by algorithmic stablecoins. Wall Street is competing with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Institutional investment portfolios now include tokens, and venture capital is pouring billions into Web3 projects. As the lines blur between traditional and digital finance, it’s becoming clear that crypto is not a trend—it’s the next evolution of capitalism itself.</p>\n<h2>Investing in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is a highly dynamic ecosystem characterized by 24/7 trading hours, immense innovation, and often extreme volatility—all of which create both unparalleled opportunities and substantial risks for investors. The key to navigating this explosive environment lies in understanding its nuances and being able to identify asymmetric investment opportunities before they go mainstream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\"> Bitcoin (BTC)</a> continues to be the gold standard of digital assets. As the first and most secure blockchain, it offers scarcity through its capped supply and attracts interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. </p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, with its support for smart contracts and thriving DeFi ecosystem, remains a high-conviction long-term hold. However, the most compelling alpha often lies beyond the blue chips—in emerging sectors and novel protocols.</p>\n<p>Investors today are pouring capital into a range of next-generation projects such as <strong>Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong> that tackle Ethereum’s congestion and high transaction fees. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are gaining traction for enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Meanwhile, AI-integrated blockchain platforms like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are creating synergistic environments where machine learning intersects with secure, decentralized data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The modular blockchain thesis is another strong narrative capturing investor attention. Networks like Celestia and Cosmos build composable ecosystems where components can be decoupled and customized, enabling faster innovation and higher performance at scale. Combine these with DAO-based governance models, and you're looking at investment potential akin to early-stage tech startups—with added liquidity and community participation.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding macro and micro trends in the cryptocurrency space is essential for investors who aim to stay ahead of the curve. Several important movements are currently shaping the landscape, indicating a sustained and widespread integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>\n<p>First, the introduction of <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\"> Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in multiple jurisdictions marks a milestone in regulatory acceptance. These instruments have opened the door for institutional investment, providing exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct custody. As inflows rise, so does market legitimacy, creating a flywheel effect that enhances mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Another critical trend is the ongoing tokenization of <strong>real-world assets (RWAs)</strong>. From tokenized real estate and equities to fractionalized art and bonds, blockchain technology is making traditionally illiquid assets tradeable in seconds. This unlocks capital efficiency and democratizes access to markets previously reserved for elites.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong> continues to evolve, now moving towards more sustainable yield mechanisms and refined tokenomics. Protocols are focusing on utility-driven staking, insurance against smart contract risks, and integration with real-world data sources through oracles. Additionally, compliance layers are being introduced to satisfy regulatory criteria without compromising decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> are also undergoing a transformation. No longer just speculative art pieces, NFTs are being utilized in gaming ecosystems, intellectual property management, ticketing systems, and even decentralized identity solutions. This diversification is expanding their utility and reducing their volatility over time, making them a more compelling investment segment again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as governments and regulators increase their involvement, crypto-native developers are responding with a renewed emphasis on decentralization and censorship resistance. This cat-and-mouse dynamic is driving innovation at a staggering pace—and keeping the market vibrant and investor-focused.</p>\n<h2>Maximizing Profits</h2>\n<p>To generate meaningful profit in the crypto space, investors must move beyond conventional strategies and embrace a contrarian, data-driven approach. Simple buy-and-hold tactics may yield modest returns, but the true potential lies in dynamic allocation, risk hedging, and capital deployment tailored to market cycles.</p>\n<p>One core strategy is adopting a <strong>contrarian mindset</strong>. Profits often emerge from making informed moves when sentiment is at its lowest. History has shown that buying during market capitulations—when “fear” dominates social metrics and sentiment indicators—can yield exponential gains when market confidence returns. Conversely, taking profits during irrational exuberance can protect capital and allow reentry at lower prices.</p>\n<p>Using on-chain analytics tools like Nansen, Glassnode, and Dune Analytics can offer invaluable insights into wallet activity, token supply changes, exchange inflows/outflows, and smart contract interactions. This data-driven approach can uncover accumulation patterns, early project momentum, and whale movements that often precede breakout rallies.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide early access to nascent tokens often before centralized listings. By utilizing liquidity pools, you can engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and token staking—but always with a security-first mindset. Smart contract auditing, impermanent loss mitigation, and thorough whitepaper evaluation are essential to prevent common pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Adopting strategies like <strong>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> into high-conviction assets during bearish periods allows investors to manage risk while building exposure gradually. Periodic rebalancing of the portfolio in bull markets can help lock in gains and maintain a diversified risk profile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-capitalism-2-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In an economic landscape marred by rising inflation and diminishing real returns from traditional financial instruments, crypto presents a disruptive alternative for savvy investors—<strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong>. These assets are far more than just digital representations of the U.S. dollar; they are engineered on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to <i>generate ongoing, passive income</i> with minimal price volatility. As we move into 2025, yield-bearing stablecoins are becoming a transformative force, enabling individuals to monetize idle liquidity without the red tape of conventional banking systems. With a few clicks, investors can earn real yield while retaining the dollar-peg stability they trust—this is income on autopilot, redefined for the digital age.</p>\n<h2>The Growing Importance of Passive Income</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newcomer, one investing truth remains evergreen: <strong>the power of passive income compounds over time</strong>. This principle becomes even more essential during extended bear markets, where portfolio prices fall, market sentiment nosedives, and liquidity becomes elusive. Traditional strategies often falter under such conditions, but passive income allows investors to weather volatility by providing steady, reliable returns.</p>\n<p>Yield-bearing stablecoins address this need elegantly. They offer a mechanism to earn yield without the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In downturns, when price action becomes unpredictable or outright hostile, predictable earnings from these digital instruments serve as a stabilizing force. Whether you're taking a conservative approach or diversifying across high-risk altcoins, passive income can cushion losses and even provide a basis for reinvestment. In fact, some of the most profitable DeFi portfolios have been carved out and grown during periods when the rest of the market stalled or retraced.</p>\n<h2>What Are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?</h2>\n<p>To understand their value, we need to differentiate basic stablecoins from their yield-generating cousins. Standard stablecoins like USDC and USDT simply act as blockchain-based representations of fiat currency. They are typically used for transfers, trading, or holding value. However, they offer <i>zero yield</i>—unless manually deployed into DeFi yield farms, lending platforms, or liquidity pools. That’s where <strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong> redefine the model.</p>\n<p>Examples like <strong>yETH</strong> from Yearn Finance, <strong>aUSDC</strong> issued by Aave, and <strong>sDAI</strong> via Spark Protocol accumulate interest directly from underlying strategies. When you hold these tokens, you participate in lending markets, staking mechanisms, or automated DeFi strategies without doing the heavy lifting yourself. These assets are programmatically designed to capture yield from verified DeFi sources and automatically rebalance for maximum efficiency. There is no need for staking, locking periods, or gas-intensive interaction with smart contracts. These stablecoins offer set-it-and-forget-it convenience.</p>\n<p>Because their earnings are embedded in the token design, yield-bearing stablecoins also benefit from composability across protocols. They can be used as collateral, integrated into vaults, or supplied to other apps where they continue earning—turning one financial position into a multitasking income engine.</p>\n<h2>Key Factors That Influence Yield Generation</h2>\n<p>Not all yield-bearing stablecoins are created equal. The source and sustainability of the yield, along with other macro and technical indicators, greatly affect how much you can earn and how secure your position really is.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong>The foundational risk rests within the protocol generating the yield. Is the core revenue derived from lending, validator staking, or liquidity provision? Or is it based on inflationary token emissions that could dry up overnight? Sustainable yield comes from value-generating activity, not financial engineering.</li>\n      <li><strong>Adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL):</strong>A higher TVL often signals trust and usage volume but can also compress yields as more users chase limited returns. Conversely, emerging protocols may offer higher APYs but carry greater implementation or security risk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Smart Contract Optimization:</strong>Yield-bearing stablecoins rely on automation, and the quality of the smart contracts determines performance. Solutions that include real-time rebalancing, adaptive fee routing, and smart reinvestment strategies usually outperform more static alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Asset Backing and Transparency:</strong>Some tokens are fully collateralized with high-grade assets or deploy clear rate models with strong reserves. Others mix loose asset backing with speculative tokenomics—often hiding risks. Thorough due diligence is not optional; smart investors demand clarity, particularly in hectic markets.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In sum, reliable passive income is about both yield and risk. An attractive APY means little if capital is at risk due to an insecure or mismanaged platform.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of passive earnings, <strong>there are risks involved</strong>. Soft rugs, smart contract exploits, protocol governance failures, and depegging events can all significantly impact returns—or wipe them out entirely.
