Once analysed the files were deleted.</p>\n    <p>One of the details in the stolen data is \"Total Sales\" which shows how much money a person has spent with each brand.</p>\n    <p>Some customers are shown to have spent more than $10,000 with a handful spending $30,000-$86,000 in stores in the small sample analysed by the BBC.</p>\n    <p>This information is particularly concerning for victims as it could lead to high spenders being targeted by secondary hacks and scams if the hacker decides to leak the information to other criminals.</p>\n    <p>Shiny Hunters appears to be acting alone and told the BBC over Telegram chat that they breached the luxury brands in April through Kering.</p>\n    <p>The hacker contacted the French company in early June and claims to have been in on-off negotiations with them over a ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. This is denied by the company which says it has not engaged in any conversations with the criminal.</p>\n    <p>The company says it has refused to pay the hacker in accordance with long-standing law enforcement advice.</p>\n    <p>\"In June, we identified that an unauthorized third party gained temporary access to our systems and accessed limited customer data from some of our Houses. No financial information - such as bank account numbers, credit card information, or government-issued identification numbers - was involved in the incident,\" a Kering spokesperson said adding it has since secured its IT systems.</p>\n    <p>The data breach which happened in April came at the time of a wave of attacks on luxury brands including Cartier and Louis Vuitton also disclosed breaches to customers and the public.</p>\n    <p>It's not known if those attacks are linked to Shiny Hunters.</p>\n    <p>In June, cyber security experts at Google issued a warning about a trend of attacks linked to Shiny Hunters that the tech giant also subsequently fell victim to.</p>\n    <p>The hacker or hackers are known by Google as UNC6040 which have been stealing data through tricking employees into handing over their log in details for internal company Salesforce software.</p>\n    <h2>What to do you if your information has been stolen</h2>\n    <p>Stolen information in cyber-attacks may include your name, address, date of birth and online order history.</p>\n    <p>Scammers may use these to try and look genuine and contact you pretending to be another organisation, including a bank or government.</p>\n    <p>So it's important to stay vigilant if you receive suspicious emails, messages or phone calls.</p>\n    <p>Be aware that scammers often try and press you to do something urgently.</p>\n    <p>If you do get a call from your bank and are unsure if it's genuine, hang up and call the number on your card or the bank's website.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/recovering-a-hacked-account\">National Cyber Security Agency</a> says you should change your password, and use two-factor authentication if possible.</p>\n    <p>Passwords made up of three random words are harder to crack, and do not reuse password across multiple accounts.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

Be kind to yourself</h2>\n    <p>Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping.</p>\n    <p>Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched.</p>\n    <p>Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it.</p>\n    <p>If you are concerned then you should contact your GP.</p>\n    <h2>2. Create routines</h2>\n    <p>Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory.</p>\n    <p>Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\"</p>\n    <p>It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making.</p>\n    <h2>3. Take breaks</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7672/live/5fead5c0-8f1b-11f0-8ce3-5fb6152ae494.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Person is organizing their work and personal agenda in a notebook at home, using sticky notes and colorful markers to plan their week, surrounded by envelopes, a smartphone, and a notepad \"/>\n    <p>It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room.</p>\n    <p>But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely.</p>\n    <p>Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly.</p>\n    <p>Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next.</p>\n    <h2>4. Use calendars and reminders</h2>\n    <p>Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness.</p>\n    <p>Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space.</p>\n    <p>Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores.</p>\n    <p>This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\"</p>\n    <h2>Swans</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/76e5/live/f7a2f920-8f1a-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman in a white top drinks water in a kitchen surrounded by fresh vegetables and a laptop\"/>\n    <p>Alongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen focus.</p>\n    <p>Each letter stands for a key habit that can help clear the mental mist and keep your mind performing at its best:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Sleep:</strong>Sleep is non-negotiable - it gives your brain time to rest and consolidate memories. Aim for between seven and nine hours each night.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Water:</strong>Our bodies are about 60% water and even mild dehydration can make you feel unfocused so keep water nearby and sip it regularly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Moving your body boosts blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps you think more clearly. Try going on short walks, a light jog or regularly stretching</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong>Nourish your brain with whole foods rather than processed ones. Choline is a nutrient vital for brain health so eating food that is rich in it like eggs, fish and nuts can support concentration and focus.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Stress:</strong>Chronic stress floods the body with cortisol - a hormone that helps regulate your body's response to stress - and that can cloud your thinking. Find ways to lower stress through breathing exercises, mindfulness and hobbies.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Use the <a href=\"https://www.newcastle-hospitals.nhs.uk/services/great-north-childrens-hospital/childrens-health-psychology/resources/managing-brain-fog/\">NHS website</a> to find out more about brain fog and how to manage it.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87ydw7xdxvo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Its prime minister urged the international community to stop applying \"double standards\" and to punish Israel.</p>\n    <p>Qatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel. It has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012.</p>\n    <p>On Sunday, Netanyahu told reporters that the US-Israel relationship was as \"durable as the stones in the Western Wall\" while he and Rubio made a short visit to the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City.</p>\n    <p>During the trip - on which they were accompanied by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee - Rubio wrote a note and placed it into the wall, a traditional ritual performed by visitors. The men ignored reporters' questions focusing on Israel's strikes in Qatar.</p>\n    <p>Also thought to have been discussed by Netanyahu and Rubio are Israeli military plans to seize Gaza City and Israel's continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, the Israeli military pressed ahead with the demolition of residential buildings in Gaza City, and - according to local media - is now poised to begin ground operations in the Western neighbourhoods of the city.</p>\n    <p>It has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area.</p>\n    <p>Some say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City.</p>\n    <p>The UN has warned an intensification of the offensive on an area where a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg4p90z1kxo\">famine has already been declared</a> will push civilians into an \"even deeper catastrophe\". </p>\n    <p>Netanyahu and Rubio's meeting comes ahead of a UN General Assembly session next week, at which some leading US allies - including the UK, France, Canada, Australia and Belgium - are expected to recognise the State of Palestine.</p>\n    <p>This expected recognition has intensified debate within Israel around the future of the West Bank, with more hardline elements of the government insisting annexation is the only way to prevent a Palestinian state.</p>\n    <p>In late August, the Israeli government gave final approval for the E1 settlement project east of Jerusalem, which would, in effect, split the West Bank in two - dividing the Palestinian populations in the north and south.</p>\n    <p>Signing an agreement to press ahead with E1 last Thursday, Netanyahu said: \"We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier this month, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich unveiled his proposal for the annexation of approximately four-fifths of the West Bank.</p>\n    <p>Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.</p>\n    <p>The settlements are illegal under international law.</p>\n    <p>On Monday evening, Rubio is set to visit the City of David archaeological park, which was established by a settler organisation in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan, in occupied East Jerusalem.</p>\n    <p>He will attend the inauguration of the \"Pilgrimage Road\", a tunnel excavated underneath Palestinian homes that is said to mark the route of a Roman-era street taken by pilgrims to the Biblical temple that once stood on the site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary).</p>\n    <p>Critics say the City of David park is an attempt to politicise archaeology, at the expense of Palestinian residents.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxw4xkxg51o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The 77th Primetime Emmys Awards generated another slate of viral moments, from cash awards for short speeches to history-making wins and heartfelt thank yous.</p>\n<p>This year's big winners of the night were HBO's medical drama The Pitt, Apple TV+'s Hollywood satire The Studio and Netflix's chilling psychological miniseries Adolescence.</p>\n<p>Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series.</p>\n<p>The Late Show host Stephen Colbert pulled off a big win after his fellow nominees in the talk show category rallied behind him following his show's abrupt cancellation.</p>\n<p>And awards night host Nate Bargatze implored winners to keep their long-winded speeches snappy with a running gag that saw his charity donation docked if speech-givers went over their allotted time.</p>\n<p>Here's a look at this year's big moments from the ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.</p>\n<h2>Adolescence sweeps its category</h2>\n<p>Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne's drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd72d98gj58o\">dominated the miniseries category</a> with wins for best series and for stars Owen Cooper and supporting actress Erin Doherty.</p>\n<p>Cooper, 15, made Emmys history as the youngest supporting actor to win his category, and delivered a heart-warming acceptance speech after giving presenter Sydney Sweeney a shy hug.</p>\n<p>\"It means so much to me, my family, people back home. So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,\" Cooper said backstage after his win.</p>\n<p>Backstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would \"spark a bit of a conversation in the UK\" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success.</p>\n<h2>The Studio wins big</h2>\n<p>The Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season.</p>\n<p>Rogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's \"getting embarrassing\".</p>\n<p>Alas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech.</p>\n<h2>The Pitt bests Severance</h2>\n<p>It came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee.</p>\n<p>The Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win \"a dream\".</p>\n<p>\"I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,\" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama.</p>\n<p>Before that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show.</p>\n<h2>Host Nate Bargatze keeps speeches in check with a cheque</h2>\n<p>First-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over.</p>\n<p>\"It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea.</p>\n<p>The \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag.</p>\n<p>The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>During a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's \"actually making money\".</p>\n<p>But with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add on another $100,000.</p>\n<h2>Severance's Trammell Tillman makes Emmys history</h2>\n<p>Severance star Tramell Tillman, who plays the enigmatic Seth Milchick in Apple TV+'s mind-bending drama, became the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series in the award show's 77-year history.</p>\n<p>During his speech, Tillman dedicated the award to his mother, whom he described as his first acting coach.</p>\n<p>Speaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams.</p>\n<p>He said his character is a man that is aware of his race and place \"in the world of Lumon\" and was proud that he was able to \"elevate his story\" and \"practice authenticity\" on the show.</p>\n<h2>Despite show being axed, a gracious Colbert thanks CBS</h2>\n<p>Colbert, whose late-night chat show The Late Show was<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20n4q0q9zqo\"> cancelled by CBS earlier this year</a>, offered up his vintage headshot and made a public plea for work when he took the stage as a presenter early in the telecast. He also received a standing ovation and rapturous chants of \"Stephen, Stephen!\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9zep0y7reo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.</p>\n    <p>However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.</p>\n    <p>His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"It is getting to the point where the only difference between them is just a slightly lighter shade of blue.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On a scorchingly hot day in the American Midwest, Tim Maxwell is voicing his fears about the future of farming.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects.</p>\n<p>\"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company.</p>\n<p>He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs.</p>\n<p>\"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\"</p>\n<p>His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops.</p>\n<p>American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July.</p>\n<p>With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening.</p>\n<p>Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis.</p>\n<p>Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular.</p>\n<p>Mr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says.</p>\n<p>\"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\"</p>\n<p>So why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy?</p>\n<h2>Farmers on a 'trade and financial precipice'</h2>\n<p>If you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days.</p>\n<p>There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar.</p>\n<p>But when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs.</p>\n<p>\"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine.</p>\n<p>\"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\"</p>\n<p>In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China.</p>\n<p>In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China.</p>\n<p>Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock.</p>\n<p>September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year.</p>\n<p>Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University.</p>\n<p>\"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\"</p>\n<p>The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser.</p>\n<p>Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States…</p>\n<p>\"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke.</p>\n<p>\"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\"</p>\n<p>American farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency.</p>\n<p>In a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\"</p>\n<h2>Trump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day'</h2>\n<p>Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjedvwed1xgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Many truly great works of art over the years have been shot in one take - from World War One epic 1917 to the Spice Girls' music video for Wannabe.</p>\n<p>But a lot of the most famous examples - including that 90s girlband masterpiece - weren't actually shot continuously in real life. They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been.</p>\n<p>One of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyxn4wqkq0o\">which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards,</a> was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption.</p>\n<p>It's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March.</p>\n<p>Audiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama.</p>\n<p>Its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world.</p>\n<p>The drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed.</p>\n<p>Cooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode.</p>\n<p>They find him in his bedroom and place him under arrest. \"You're making a big mistake,\" insists the boy's dad, played by Stephen Graham, who also co-created the series with writer Jack Thorne.</p>\n<p>But as the episode unfolds, it's clear there is no mistake. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately proves Jamie's guilt, and Adolescence begins to examine its key questions: what led to this murder, and what motive could a teenager possibly have had.</p>\n<p>It was a storyline based on real events. \"I read an article about a young boy who'd stabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Wcu3t4yOQbE?si=-lJLGBjecSfL-5RH&amp;t=104\">Graham told Radio X's Chris Moyles</a>.</p>\n<p>A similar but separate teen stabbing hit the headlines just a couple of months later. \"And these two incidents were at the opposite ends of the country,\" Graham noted.</p>\n<p>\"And I just thought, why is this happening? And not just because I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compass can look at that situation and think, what's going on with society today that we're in this era where these young boys are stabbing young girls to death?\"</p>\n<p>Graham knew the success of the show would hinge on the young actor chosen to play Jamie, and casting director Shaheen Baig struck gold with Cooper - who had first become interested in acting around the age of 10.</p>\n<p>In a joint interview with Baig, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/owen-cooper-shaheen-baig-adolescence\">Cooper explained:</a> \"I don't know where it came from, but I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer.</p>\n<p>\"I still play football now, and then asking them if I wanted to start drama lessons, it was a bit out of the blue, really.\"</p>\n<p>Baig recalled: \"It was really [about] trying to find somebody with the emotional register to be able to play Jamie.</p>\n<p>\"Owen sent us an improv tape, and I remember first watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart.\" It felt very natural.\"</p>\n<p>Many of the headlines surrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wasn't actually true.</p>\n<p>\"It has frustrated us a bit,\" said drama teacher Esther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting classes Cooper had attended for two years in Didsbury, Manchester.</p>\n<p>The Adolescence team, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp91yz4p44vo\">she told BBC News in April,</a> had approached the Drama MOB school while casting the series, asking to see tapes of their \"strongest northern boys\".</p>\n<p>\"They kept coming back for Owen,\" she recalled. \"He just had something.\"</p>\n<p>It was true that Cooper didn't have any TV or film credits to his name, but not that he had never tried his hand at acting.</p>\n<p>In fact, Morgan suggested Cooper's comfort with one-take shooting was partly due to the drama school's focus on improvisation.</p>\n<p>When the show launched, Morgan said: \"It felt amazing, but I didn't realise it would be as good as it was, I didn't expect it to be talked about so much.\"</p>\n<p>For several weeks, the series dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday).</p>\n<p>\"We wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament,\" <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/18/adolescence-writer-jack-thorne-incel-culture-netflix\">Thorne said.</a></p>\n<p>The government subsequently supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised.</p>\n<p>Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood\" <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2025/03/19/adolescence-review-it-will-chill-the-blood-of-any-parent-of/\">said the Telegraph's Anita Singh</a>. It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\"</p>\n<p>Clearly, Emmy voters didn't forget about it either. The show's impact was so undeniable that it was seen as the dead-cert for best limited series.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd72d98gj58o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
