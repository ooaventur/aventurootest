That will take it to £12,534.60 a year, a rise of £561.60 compared with now.</li>\n      <li>The old basic state pension - for those who reached state pension age before April 2016 - is expected to go up to £184.75 a week. That will take it to £9,607 a year, a rise of £431.60 compared with now.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Sir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <p>The standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying tax.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027.</p>\n    <p>\"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>Not all pensioners get the full amount, because it depends on years of qualifying contributions through the National Insurance system.</p>\n    <p>For many retired people, the state pension is not their only source of income as they will also receive money from workplace or private pensions.</p>\n    <p>The state pension is the second-largest item in the government budget after health spending.</p>\n    <p>The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition designed the triple lock to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the incomes of working people.</p>\n    <p>But there has been intense debate over the cost of the triple lock and whether it is justified, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves previously pledging that the Labour government would keep it in place until the end of the current parliament.</p>\n    <p>In July, the government's official forecaster said the cost of the triple lock guarantee was set to be three times higher by the end of the decade than was originally anticipated when it began.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Three and a half years later he's been released in a prisoner swap, one of eight civilians freed in a surprise move.</p>\n    <p>While Russia and Ukraine have swapped military prisoners of war before, it is very rare for Russia to release Ukrainian civilians.</p>\n    <p>Dmytro has been catching up frantically on all he's missed. But he's also phoning the families of every Ukrainian he met in captivity: he memorised all their names and each detail.</p>\n    <p>He knows that for some, his call may be the first confirmation that their relative is alive.</p>\n    <h2>The welcome home</h2>\n    <p>There were celebrations here last month when Dmytro was returned from Russia in a group of 146 Ukrainians.</p>\n    <p>A crowd came out waving blue and yellow national flags, cheering as the buses carrying the freed men passed hooting their horns.</p>\n    <p>Most on board were soldiers with sunken cheeks, emaciated after their years behind bars.</p>\n    <p>Officials won't say exactly how they got the eight Ukrainian civilians back in the same exchange, only that it involved sending back in return \"people Russia was interested in\".</p>\n    <p>One source said those included residents of the Kursk region in Russia, evacuated when Ukrainian forces launched their 2024 incursion. The group's exact status after that is unclear.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9b2f/live/8eb556a0-923b-11f0-a1c9-9feb11d883c1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ombudsman's Office The moment Dmytro Khyliuk was freed. The photo shows Dmytro hugging someone, while draped in a Ukrainian flag, with a big grin on his face\"/>\n    <p>Stepping off the bus to a cheering crowd, Dmytro's first phone call was to tell his mother he was free. Both his parents are elderly and unwell and his greatest fear had been never seeing them again.</p>\n    <p>\"The hardest was not knowing when you'll be allowed back. You could be freed the next day or stay prisoner for 10 years. Nobody knows how long it's for.\"</p>\n    <h2>Constant cruelty</h2>\n    <p>We met Dmytro shortly after his release as he recuperated at a Kyiv hospital.</p>\n    <p>The details he shared of his captivity are chilling.</p>\n    <p>\"They grabbed us and literally dragged us to the prison and on the way they beat us with rubber batons shouting things like, 'How many people have you killed?'\" he said, describing his transfer to Russia.</p>\n    <p>He was held in multiple facilities and his account chimes with many others we've heard over the years.</p>\n    <p>\"Sometimes they'd let the guard dog off its leash so that it could bite us. The cruelty was really shocking and it was constant.\"</p>\n    <p>He tells me he was bitten and left bleeding. \"I was so stressed I only felt the pain 20 minutes later.\"</p>\n    <p>The journalist was never charged with any crime.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfb6/live/889398c0-923d-11f0-a1c9-9feb11d883c1.png.webp\" alt=\"Francesco Tosto/BBC Dmytro's father holds a note they received from their son while he was held by Russia, reading &quot;I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok&quot; \"/>\n    <p>Physically the first year was the hardest. \"We were starving. We were given very little food for a long time,\" he remembers. He lost more than 20kg in the first few months, causing him dizzy spells. But the soldiers he was held with were treated far worse.</p>\n    <p>\"They would call them for interrogation, and they were beaten and tortured with electric shock,\" Dmytro remembers.</p>\n    <p>He heard their pain and saw the bruises.</p>\n    <h2>His parents' fear</h2>\n    <p>The journalist's family home is a world away from all that, in the pretty village of Kozarovychi just outside Kyiv.</p>\n    <p>It feels peaceful, apart from the air raids, with gardens full of poultry, blackberry bushes and fruit trees.</p>\n    <p>But the back wall of Dmytro's house still has chunks torn out of it by shrapnel and the lawn was only just repaired where Russian troops had parked a tank.</p>\n    <p>In 2022, right at the start of their full-scale invasion when the Russians were advancing on Kyiv, they took over the village.</p>\n    <p>A few days later, as Dmytro and his father, Vasyl, tried to check the damage to their home, they were detained.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3846/live/57fe6bf0-923c-11f0-a1c9-9feb11d883c1.png.webp\" alt=\"Francesco Tosto/BBC Dmytro's parents Halyna and Vasyl sit on their bed at home in the Kyiv region\"/>\n    <p>Russian troops forced both men to the ground, bound and blindfolded them, and marched them into captivity. The pair now know they were held in a basement beneath the local warehouses where the Russians had made their base.</p>\n    <p>The men were moved several times as the number of civilian detainees increased.</p>\n    <p>Vasyl was eventually set free but for many months he feared the worst for his son.</p>\n    <p>\"I didn't know where he'd been taken and I was scared,\" the pensioner tells me. \"There were gunshots at night. One man was taken outside, then a shot was fired. He didn't come back. I still don't know the fate of all the people who were there.\"</p>\n    <p>Then he and his wife got a tiny scrap of paper from a Russian prison.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok,\" Dmytro wrote to them both, in Ukrainian. They would receive just one more note in his entire time in captivity.</p>\n    <h2>Ukraine's missing</h2>\n    <p>Other families have had no news at all.</p>\n    <p>Across Ukraine, officials say more than 16,000 civilians are currently missing. So far, they've only located a fraction of them in Russian prisons.</p>\n    <p>Moscow doesn't publish lists because detaining civilians with no cause is illegal.

We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

We always made sure to make a proper night of it whenever he was fighting, and he gave us some great memories.\"</p>\n    <p>Hatton built up a stellar record in the light-welterweight ranks, winning 41 consecutive fights in a career that began in 1997 in Widnes, and the bright lights of America were irresistible.</p>\n    <p>Hatton fought and beat Colombia's Juan Urango and Mexican Jose Luis Castillo in Paradise, the neighbourhood that contains many of the famous Vegas tourist hotspots.</p>\n    <p>His reputation as a star attraction in Nevada was growing, as was his fanbase.</p>\n    <p>Armed with a 43-0 record, Hatton challenged global superstar Floyd Mayweather for his welterweight belts in 2007, this time at the MGM Grand.</p>\n    <p>This was in an era before Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury headlined stadiums.</p>\n    <p>It was Hatton's time, and it was witnessed by Hatton's people. Many planeloads of them.</p>\n    <p>A pre-fight weigh-in was attended by over 5,000 people, many of them travelling Hatton fans who serenaded him with chants of \"Walking in a Hatton wonderland\" while relentlessly booing pound-for-pound all-time great Mayweather.</p>\n    <p>Hatton was a Manchester City supporter, but he united Mancunians.</p>\n    <p>\"I've never seen anything like that weigh-in,\" says Sean McManamon, a fan from Urmston who attended the Mayweather fight with his father and a friend.</p>\n    <p>\"The Americans were stunned by the amount of people and the noise. It was deafening.</p>\n    <p>\"We paid about £700 for tickets to the fight - they were right at the back, but we just had to be there.</p>\n    <p>\"Ricky was a proper Mancunian. We're big United fans, but you put your football allegiance aside for Ricky Hatton.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/946/cpsprodpb/1cb0/live/ebfa96f0-9276-11f0-8447-89d0c49c75e5.jpg\" alt=\"Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis carry Ricky Hatton's belts into the ring before his fight against Paulie Malignaggi at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in 2008\"/>\n    <p>Before the Malignaggi fight in 2008, Hatton's belts were brought into the ring by Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis</p>\n    <p>A raucous crowd sang Hatton's name throughout the fight, but their hero was defeated by knockout in the 10th round. He claimed to have lost concentration after being infuriated by the referee's decision to deduct a point from his score in round six.</p>\n    <p>But the thousands who followed Hatton across the Atlantic were proud to have done so, and the contrast between the rugged Hatton and the pristine Mayweather drew in new fans.</p>\n    <p>\"Thousands of us just descended on Vegas,\" says 45-year-old James Corcoran, a Hatton fan who hosts the Oasis Podcast and travelled for the Mayweather contest.</p>\n    <p>\"The atmosphere was electric - everywhere you went, all you heard was 'One Ricky Hatton' being sung. Everyone loved him.</p>\n    <p>\"Mayweather was American and the number one boxer in the world. But Ricky really connected with people there - there were lots of Americans supporting him.</p>\n    <p>\"We're all often drawn to the athletes who aren't the polished, consummate professionals but feel more like someone you could have bumped into in the pub the night before.</p>\n    <p>\"That's who he was. It's like the British Rocky story.\"</p>\n    <p>Hatton's next assignment was a May 2008 homecoming fight against Juan Lazcano, winning on points in front of 55,000 at the home of his beloved Manchester City.</p>\n    <p>That earned him a return to the MGM Grand six months later to defend his light-welterweight belts, and this time Hatton won big in Vegas, defeating the Italian-American Paulie Malignaggi whose corner threw in the towel in the 11th round.</p>\n    <p>Before the fight, so many travelling fans from the North West had made the trip that a beaming Hatton took part in a photo shoot in which he held up transparent bags full of tickets.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/f308/live/c11792c0-9272-11f0-b8e5-3be75a11e2ba.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Hatton poses with transparent bags full of tickets before his 2008 light-welterwight fight with Paulie Malignaggi at the MCM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas\"/>\n    <p>Ricky Hatton's popularity drew thousands of fans from Manchester to Las Vegas, despite the high cost of flights, tickets and accommodation</p>\n    <p>\"I went to the Malignaggi fight with a few of my mates,\" says Jamie Hind. \"It was an incredible experience being out there with all of the other fans from the North West who had come over.</p>\n    <p>\"When it's somebody that you feel you have a real affinity with, heading to Vegas to back him just felt like it was an opportunity too good to miss, one of the best things you could do with your life.\"</p>\n    <p>A final return to Vegas came in 2009, when Hatton went head to head with Manny Pacquiao. The Filipino had already won titles in five different divisions and was too strong for Hatton, knocking him out in the second round.</p>\n    <p>It turned out to be the penultimate fight of Hatton's professional career, and the last in Vegas.</p>\n    <p>But the Stateside legacy that Hatton left, and the experiences he gave to the fans who travelled so far to cheer him on alongside their loved ones, will be cherished long after his untimely death.</p>\n    <p>\"We still talk about going over there to follow him now,\" McManamon says.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't see my mate who I went to the Mayweather fight with that much any more, but last time I did we spent ages talking about what a privilege it was to go and see Ricky fight there.</p>\n    <p>\"Anyone who went to one of those fights will never forget it. He typified that Mancunian heart and sense of humour.</p>\n    <p>\"He was one of the lads. That's why people loved him so much.\"</p>\n    <h2>Related topics</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published1 day ago</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"Ricky Hatton poses in a gym\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/df15/live/c69ef830-917a-11f0-974d-05c67cdfea1c.jpg 976w\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published1 day ago</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"Boxer Ricky Hatton (left) and footballer Wayne Rooney (right) in the ring after a Hatton victory in Las Vegas in 2007\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/343/cpsprodpb/dcb8/live/885eafe0-91aa-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/dcb8/live/885eafe0-91aa-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/dcb8/live/885eafe0-91aa-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 320w\" width=\"343\" height=\"193\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/c5yvedx7yw1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is vital sign to show a women's body is healthy.</p>\n    <p>Other teams adopt different tracking methods, with Wales using Vodafone's Connect app which has GPS trackers - placed in the players' shirts - combined with data collected on their performance, menstrual cycle phases and mental and physical wellbeing.</p>\n    <p>Their players also get daily monitoring questions on the app.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/c26c/live/2d9448f0-8e61-11f0-96e7-475804d250b1.jpg\" alt=\"A picture of Red Rose Abby Dow running with the World Cup ball\"/>\n    <p>Dow made her debut for England in 2017 and scored five tries in her first two games</p>\n    <h2>'Cocktails' and adjustments in gym - how data is used</h2>\n    <p>After the physios and doctors have looked at the data, adaptations can be made in training, which could include a reduction of intensity, taking out extra conditioning or in a lot of cases adding extra mobility sessions in the warm-up.</p>\n    <p>\"It's about working out how can we maximise ourselves and when you are not feeling so great [bleeding], how can we adjust things like the gym to suit you,\" explained Dow.</p>\n    <p>\"You are not going to get PBs [personal bests] and that is OK.</p>\n    <p>\"The coaches are not going to go, 'can you push?', because we know that that isn't going to happen and that isn't something to be frowned upon.\"</p>\n    <p>Jarrell-Searcy, 26, said her team's coaches are \"very careful with our numbers and pushing into what they call, the red zone\".</p>\n    <p>The red zone can be seen where a player is in a state where they are fatigued and more at risk of injury through tiredness.</p>\n    <p>\"It's cycle informed, but it's not as cycle mediated,\" added Jarrell-Searcy.</p>\n    <p>This means the menstrual cycle doesn't control what adaptations are made, it just influences decisions made by the professionals.</p>\n    <p>The menstrual cycle is personal, so often the physios will monitor the player during the sessions and games, but it is unlikely they will sit out training or a game.</p>\n    <p>\"The perception of a period can take over, but when the players have their rugby head on, they tend to be focused and pretty involved,\" said Okell.</p>\n    <p>Regardless of periods, Jarrell-Searcy added the game schedule stayed the same and a bleed was \"not going to make or break you as an athlete\".</p>\n    <p>There are other things to aid players during stages of their menstrual cycle.</p>\n    <p>Clubs have nutritionists who can use the tracking data from players to help prepare the body for the bleed and ensure they get enough nutrients before, during and after sessions.</p>\n    <p>For example, an athlete will eat more carbohydrates to give them the energy stores they need.</p>\n    <p>\"Some athletes will have a heavier bleed than others and we have to look at whether they will need some medical intervention in terms of adding in tablets.\" added Okell.</p>\n    <p>This would give athletes more vitamins and minerals they might lose during a bleed.</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We're not men's athletes, so we need to more so than just 40g of protein a day every day.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It's not like this like 24-hour cycle that they (men) get to have,\" said Jarell-Searcy. \"We do need to be aware that you have to increase your intake of certain things and your behaviour around recovery to accommodate your hormonal fluctuations.\"</p>\n    <p>Players also take things to try to minimise the pain of cramping in the stomach so they can continue to perform.</p>\n    <p>This includes 'Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail' - named after a former member of the USA medical and physio team - which is a mixture of vitamins and minerals designed to replace those lost during a bleed.</p>\n    <p>\"You just take it and then tough it out for the the next 20 minutes until it kicks in and then you're OK to train,\" revealed Jarrell-Searcy.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published1 February 2023</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Is there a link between injury and periods?</h2>\n    <p>No research shows there is any particular time a player is more at risk of injury during the menstrual cycle.</p>\n    <p>\"We can injure ourselves on every day of the menstrual cycle,\" said Okell.</p>\n    <p>\"It's really hard to say that players are getting injured in the phases without the specific hormonal testing.\"</p>\n    <p>According to a study conducted by the National Library of Medicine, 'a causal relationship has not yet been established', to whether a menstrual cycle is related to injuries.</p>\n    <p>However, Okell said there may be a link between injury and the lack of confidence to move freely for fear of leaking on their shorts.</p>\n    <p>She explained players \"change their movement patterns and the way they do things that can potentially cause an injury risk\".</p>\n    <p>\"We would promote this is something we don't need to be fearful [of] and hold yourself back or not do a particular training,\" added Okell.</p>\n    <h2>Related topics</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published1 day ago</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"The new Women's Rugby World Cup trophy\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1600/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/a9e9/live/f4c98fa0-8c83-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png 976w\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published9 December 2023</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cgqnklkq81po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy.\"</p>\n    <p>But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: \"AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines,\" she said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmek723dz9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Also if a user aged under 16 is using TikTok after 10pm it prompts a 'wind down' feature with a full-screen reminder.</li>\n      <li>Snapchat pointed us to their UK parent guide in which it suggests that parents set screen time guidelines with their children.</li>\n      <li>Instagram parent company Meta says that they have introduced 'Instagram Teen Accounts' which switch to sleep mode after 10pm and remind users to leave the app after 60 minutes. There are also parental supervision tools on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.</li>\n      <li>YouTube says it has \"robust\" parental controls and has recently made its Take a Break and Bedtime reminders more prominent.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lelqg0jy3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To confirm terms and conditions, click the \"Apply Now\" button and review info on the secure credit card terms page.</p>\n    <p>&#13;\n\tLow interest rate (or 0%) credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars on <a href=\"https://www.comparecards.com/balance-transfer\">balance transfers</a> and on routine purchases carried over as credit card balances. Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tKeep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR.  Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tGenerally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers – within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a <a href=\"https://www.comparecards.com\">credit card</a> that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tThe interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Methodology</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Credit scores ranges may vary.

    "body": "<p>It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.</p>\n<p>But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.</p>\n<p>And once installed, it’s tough to remove.</p>\n<p>\n            While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo<strong> </strong>has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.\n    </p>\n<p>In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.</p>\n<p>Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.</p>\n<p>“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”</p>\n<p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.</p>\n<p>\n            Some American lawmakers are pushing for a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/tiktok-ban-national-security-hearing/index.html\">national ban</a> on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/tech/tiktok-ceo-hearing/index.html\">was grilled</a> by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/tech/temu-shopping-app-us-popularity-intl-hnk/index.html\">topping US download charts</a> and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.\n    </p>\n<p>While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.</p>\n<p>\n            There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/media/tiktok-ceo-congress-reliable-sources/index.html\">there are concerns</a> from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The findings follow <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">Google’s suspension</a> of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pinduoduo-app-malware-detailed-by-cybersecurity-researchers?sref=IIP4JEyu\">ensuing report</a> from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">previously rejected</a> “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”\n    </p>\n<p>CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.</p>\n<h2>Rise to success</h2>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and<strong> </strong>a market value three times that of eBay\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EBAY&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (EBAY)</a>, wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/tech/pinduoduo-colin-huang-intl-hnk/index.html\">Colin Huang</a>, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BABA&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (BABA)</a> and JD.com\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=JD&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (JD)</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.</p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo posted triple digit<a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\"> growth</a> in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/26/technology/pinduoduo-ipo-china-startup/index.html\">it listed</a> in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its <a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\">earnings reports</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.</p>\n<p>According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>\n<p>“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.</p>\n<p>By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.</p>\n<p>This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.</p>\n<p>The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.</p>\n<p>PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.</p>\n<h2>What experts found</h2>\n<p>Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.</p>\n<p>Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.</p>\n<p>The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.</p>\n<p>“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.</p>\n<p>The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.</p>\n<p>Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.</p>\n<p>“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.</p>\n<h2>Android targeted</h2>\n<p>\n            In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/tech/huawei-harmony-os/index.html\">Android system</a>. Apple\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (AAPL)</a>’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n    </p>\n<p>Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.</p>\n<p>CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.</p>\n<p>Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.</p>\n<p>Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.</p>\n<p>Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.</p>\n<p>Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.</p>\n<p>Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.</p>\n<p>They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.</p>\n<h2>Disbanding the team</h2>\n<p>\n            Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/P_EYQxOEupqdU0BJMRqWsw\">report</a> by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with <a href=\"https://github.com/davincifans101/pinduoduo_backdoor_detailed_report/blob/main/README.md\">their own reports</a> confirming the original findings.\n    </p>\n<p>Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.</p>\n<p>Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cnn.it/40OSomK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is a helpful perk if you plan on buying anything with the card.<strong>Choose your payment due date:</strong> A little flexibility can go a long way when it comes to managing your finances. The card lets you choose from any available payment date, whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the month. That way, you can set up automatic payments that are aligned with your paycheck.<strong>No late fees:</strong> One of the most unique perks is that there are no late fees, ever. While you should always pay your bill on time, because late payments can still affect your credit, it's nice to know that you won't be charged if you do slip up and miss a payment.<strong>No penalty APR:</strong> If you miss some payments, most credit cards will increase your interest rate to their penalty APR. The Citi Simplicity® Card never charges a penalty rate, so your APR isn't at risk of increasing due to late payments.<strong>No annual fee:</strong> This card comes with no annual fee, which is an important feature if your goal is to pay off debt.</p>\n    <p>With the quality benefits the card offers, it's primarily aimed at consumers who have a credit score of 670 or better. There are reports of people with scores in the mid 600s being approved for this card.

And they often are also subject to a cap and limited in what purchases they apply to. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is perfect for someone that wants an easy-to-use card that still offers high rewards: you’ll earn a best-in-class flat rewards right away on your purchases -- with no limits or hoops to jump through.</p>\n    <p><strong>$200 cash rewards welcome offer</strong> -- New Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card holders can earn a $200 cash rewards welcome offer for spending just $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. Not only is this a very competitive sign-up bonus for a card with no annual fee, but it's also one of the things that sets this Wells Fargo credit card apart from other 2% back cards. We’ve yet to come across another credit card with 2% unlimited cash rewards that also has a sign-up bonus.</p>\n    <p><strong>12 months from account opening 0% APR intro offer </strong>-- New cardholders can enjoy 0% intro APR on both new purchases and eligible balance transfers for a full 12 months from account opening. (After that period, a go-to rate of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies.) That's a great offer, even when compared to cards marketed just for a 0% intro APR. It means that this card will allow you to avoid interest on purchases and balance transfers for a full year!</p>\n    <p>Keep in mind that balance transfers need to be made within the first 120 days to qualify for a reduced interest rate and a lower balance transfer fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>No annual fee </strong>-- In many cases, high rewards rates mean high annual fees. Not with the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which sports a $0 annual fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>Cell phone protection</strong> -- With the price of a typical cell phone in the hundreds of dollars, having some sort of insurance is a good idea. With this Wells Fargo card, you can get built-in cell phone protection of up to $600 just by paying your cell phone bill with your card. Coverage is subject to a $25 deductible.</p>\n    <p>Approval for the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is most likely for applicants with good credit, which typically means a credit score of 670 or higher.

Nigel Farage, a man with grey hair and a purple striped tie speaks in front of a turquoise backdrop.\"/>\n    <p>People I speak to at the top of government acknowledge the last few weeks have been dreadful for them and they are kicking themselves about the mistakes they have made.</p>\n    <p>The latest twist, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgy79yr74do\">the departure of another senior aide to the prime minister, after the leaking of sexually explicit messages from nearly a decade ago</a>, is seen by some in government as symptomatic of the factional acrimony reverberating through Labour.</p>\n    <p>But there is something else going on here which amplifies the jitters within Labour and causes contortions and anguish for others here at Westminster.</p>\n    <p>You can sum it up in a word: Reform.</p>\n    <p>They are frightening their rivals right now.</p>\n    <p>Their comfortable and now sustained over months lead in the opinion polls, alongside their habit of demonstrating momentum – the defection of Conservative shadow minister Danny Kruger being the latest case in point - is accelerating the difficult questions and conundrums the other parties wrestle with.</p>\n    <p>For Labour, the fear that runs to their bones is bequeathing power to an outfit they loathe, Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>For the Conservatives, frequently leaking defectors to Nigel Farage, every one sharpens the existential questions they confront.</p>\n    <p>And for the Liberal Democrats, they have a record breaking 72 MPs but are frustrated at a perceived lack of attention, amid the din elsewhere.</p>\n    <p>Those close to the prime minister are candid about how rough things have been for them and the task they have winning back the trust of so many of their MPs.</p>\n    <p>\"We're not oblivious to the scale of the problem. We were aware of it before the summer, but the last two weeks have made it more difficult,\" is how one senior figure put it.</p>\n    <p>Another senior figure tells me Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party Conference in a fortnight's time \"will leave people in absolutely no doubt at all what he stands for and what the government stands for\".</p>\n    <p>That, in itself, is a tacit acknowledgement that from No10's point of view nowhere near enough people could say what he stands for now.</p>\n    <p>The argument we are likely to hear is being rehearsed already: the prime minister told Channel 4 News that he has every intention of sticking around as Labour's leader, and made the case for why:</p>\n    <p>\"I am absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour Party and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.\"</p>\n    <p>What, then, of Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party?</p>\n    <p>My phone rings and it is a former Conservative cabinet minister on the other end.</p>\n    <p>They say it is \"another unsurprising exit\" and describe Kruger as \"impossible\" and an \"ideologue\".</p>\n    <p>But when I bump into another former Conservative cabinet minister they are more pensive at what they fear the defection says about the Tories.</p>\n    <p>As the Conservatives also approach their annual conference, they confront a moment of peril greater than any in their modern history.</p>\n    <p>And then there is Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>Make no mistake, they face colossal questions:</p>\n    <p>Just for a start, can they build the campaigning infrastructure, the local parties, the list of vetted candidates, the policy heft and attract the talent to present themselves as a viable alternative government?</p>\n    <p>Then there is the cranking up of scrutiny they will now face, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce845w70g0yo\">such as this story from the BBC's Billy Kenber and Phil Kemp</a>.</p>\n    <p>They are taking on all of this and a lot more in the blink of an eye and it is far from certain it is do-able.</p>\n    <p>But with each passing month, their opponents treat with increasing credibility the possibility it could happen.</p>\n    <p>What we witnessing, so often, in other parties right now is their reaction to that.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2ejlpdjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It's going well, until he pulls Michael Jackson's Off The Wall from its sleeve, ready to drop the 1979 disco classic Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.</p>\n    <p>Suddenly, someone's tugging at his arm. It's the rapper Q-Tip, and there's an uncommon urgency to his voice as he shouts: \"No! You can't play that. Not in front of Prince!\"</p>\n    <p>Remembering the star's rivalry with Jackson in the 1980s, Ronson whips the record off the decks. But that leaves him with a problem.</p>\n    <p>\"At this point there's only 20 seconds left [of the previous song]. I pull another record out, but the tempos don't match and I flub the mix.\"</p>\n    <p>Ronson glances over to the VIP area, where Prince is holding court in a plush throne.</p>\n    <p>\"And he's glaring down at me like, 'What is this train wreck?'</p>\n    <p>\"It was slightly humiliating.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e6e9/live/9026fe20-9232-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Mark Ronson, with his hair dyed red, DJs at an unidentified club in 1993\"/>\n    <p>Luckily, train wrecks were a rarity.</p>\n    <p>Long before he was an Oscar-winning hitmaker for Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse, Ronson was one of New York's most in-demand DJs.</p>\n    <p>A nocturnal animal, he'd bait his prey with crates of vinyl, swooping in for the kill with a perfectly-timed drop of AC/DC's Back In Black or Busta Rhymes' Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See.</p>\n    <p>\"I could walk into any room and, almost like the Terminator, scan the crowd and be like, 'I know what the first three records are',\" he says.</p>\n    <p>That's as close to boastfulness as Ronson gets. He's so laid-back it's almost comical, speaking in a perpetually sleepy drawl, like the Big Lebowski of music.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e2b8/live/d608dad0-9232-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mark Ronson Mark Ronson as a toddler, holding up several 7-inch singles\"/>\n    <p>We meet in Notting Hill's Music and Video Exchange – the shop that kick-started his record collection – and it's only when he starts rifling through the racks that the 50-year-old comes to life.</p>\n    <p>\"This one changed my life,\" he says, pulling out a dog-eared copy of Pete Rock's They Reminisce Over You.</p>\n    <p>\"Oh, and here's Salt-N-Pepa's Shoop… Now, <i>that's</i> my song!\"</p>\n    <p>A similar enthusiasm permeates Ronson's new memoir, Night People, which concentrates on the 1990s DJ career that saw him playing for everyone from Jay-Z to Mariah Carey.</p>\n    <p>\"She had very specific songs she wanted to hear,\" he recalls. \"There was a great R&amp;B record called Say I'm Your Number One, by Princess, that she'd always request.</p>\n    <p>\"Eventually, I just knew to play it as soon as I saw her, to save her a trip to the booth.\"</p>\n    <p>When he pitched the book, which ends long before his successes with Winehouse on Back To Black and Bruno Mars on Uptown Funk, \"people were scratching their heads\", Ronson admits.</p>\n    <p>\"They were like, 'Oh right, so you want to write about the time before the thing we know you for?'\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2dd5/live/b6260350-9232-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Mark Ronson playing guitar next to Amy Winehouse singing into a microphone on stage\"/>\n    <p>But he stuck to his guns. The memoir is a heartfelt love letter to a bygone era, inspired by the death of his close friend and contemporary DJ Blu Jemz in 2018.</p>\n    <p>\"I was just staring at all the records [we used to play] on my shelf, thinking about how each one was so evocative of a memory and a moment in time.</p>\n    <p>\"It's arguably the last time New York was the apex of hip-hop both creatively and commercially - A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls, Lil' Kim, Busta Rhymes... all of it. And they were out in the clubs every night.\"</p>\n    <p>Another figure who loomed over the scene was P Diddy, aka Sean Combs, who's currently awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution.</p>\n    <p>Diddy gave Ronson one of his big breaks, hiring him to play at A-list events, including his 29th birthday party, after tipping the DJ with a $100 bill containing his phone number.</p>\n    <p>\"It's undeniable that the way he picked me for certain gigs elevated my star,\" says Ronson, calling the accusations against Diddy \"horrific\".</p>\n    <p>\"I had no idea of anything like that going on,\" he says, acknowledging the musician \"wielded a tremendous amount of power and cachet\" in New York.</p>\n    <p>\"But in the five years I DJ'd for him, I doubt he spoke more than five sentences to me.</p>\n    <p>\"He was mostly out there dancing and I knew if he was dancing, no-one was gonna yell at me.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d4b/live/f60e5580-9232-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Mark Ronson Childhood photo of Mark Ronson and his mother \"/>\n    <p>At the outset, Ronson wanted his book to capture the seediness of 90s club culture, where he'd play \"night in, night out for $100\" while \"cokehead club owners shouted at me for not playing enough Madonna\".</p>\n    <p>As he wrote, another story also emerged.</p>\n    <p>Ronson was born in London to jewellery designer Ann Dexter-Jones and music publisher Laurence Ronson. Their house in St John's Wood was a frequent haunt for actors and musicians, including Keith Moon and Robin Williams.</p>\n    <p>\"My parents had crazy parties all the time,\" he recalls. \"Fifty or 60 slightly cracked people, smoking, drinking, having a great time.\"</p>\n    <p>The aftermath was drastically different. In the book, he writes of \"angry crescendos and heavy silences\" from his parents' bedroom, which instilled a \"constant watchfulness that became instinct before I understood why\".</p>\n    <p>Later in life, DJing fulfilled a \"need for control\" that stemmed from that early instability.</p>\n    <p>\"It wasn't always the greatest way to grow up for a kid, and there was something about the DJ booth that was incredibly comforting.</p>\n    <p>\"It's like I'm an army of one. I make all the rules. It's a refuge, in a way.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f64/live/2fecf090-9233-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Andrew Wyatt, Anthony Rossomando, Lady Gaga and Mark Ronson pose with their Oscar statuettes\"/>\n    <p>Learning to navigate delicate situations also helped Ronson's career as a producer.</p>\n    <p>There's an almost too-perfect example in Lady Gaga's documentary Five Foot Two where, arriving for a recording session, the star crashes into Ronson's car.</p>\n    <p>Mortified, she enters the studio in a garbled flurry of apologies. Ronson simply stretches out his arms for a conciliatory hug.</p>\n    <p>\"If you have a problem, I wish you'd just say it to my face instead of my bumper,\" he deadpans.</p>\n    <p>The situation is immediately defused.</p>\n    <p>Reminded of the scene, he says: \"I remember working on that record [2016's Joanne] pretty well, and Lady Gaga is probably one of the most chased, hounded, paparazzi-ed people you could imagine.</p>\n    <p>\"Sometimes we'd slam the door and there'd be 20 people on the other side taking pictures. So my role is just to shut out the outside world [and] make the artist feel relaxed and comfortable at all times.</p>\n    <p>\"Even when they've trashed your car.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b08b/live/af6e7570-9231-11f0-9503-a35e38a7e112.png.webp\" alt=\"Mark Ronson and Mark Savage at the Music &amp; Video Exchange in London, comparing several records\"/>\n    <p>His unflappability also helped along Winehouse's Back To Black, bringing focus to a feverish creative streak.</p>\n    <p>\"I remember some of my friends saying, 'Oh, you're working with Amy? Good luck. She's been working on this album for three years',\" he recalls.</p>\n    <p>\"But when we got in the studio, she was such a fireball of inspiration. We demoed three or four songs, we wrote Back to Black, she wrote Rehab... All these things in five days. It's a lot of incredible memories.\"</p>\n    <p>Other songs took longer. Uptown Funk needed seven months. Dua Lipa's Barbie anthem Dance The Night was rewritten \"five or six times with different hooks\".</p>\n    <p>But those are stories for another time... and \"maybe\" a second volume of Ronson's memoir.</p>\n    <p>Right now, though, I've lost him to the record store's vinyl bins, picking out old favourites by the Stone Roses, Brand New Heavies and Cypress Hill - and prompting a moment of introspection.</p>\n    <p>\"There are people who enjoy a night out and then there are night people,\" he decides.</p>\n    <p>\"I was definitely the latter... but I had no idea where it would take me.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrge1prpyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Leviev previously denied the allegations.</p>\n    <p>Authorities did not immediately provide details of the reason for the arrest of Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut.</p>\n    <p>In 2019, Leviev was convicted of four charges of fraud in a separate case and sentenced to 15 months in prison, but he was released after serving only five months.</p>\n    <p>According to Israel's Ynet website, his lawyer told reporters Leviev had been \"traveling freely around the world\".</p>\n    <p>\"I spoke with him this morning after he was detained, but we don't yet understand the reason,\" they said after his arrest in Georgia.</p>\n    <p>Between 2017 and 2019, Leviev's catfishing scheme - creating a false online persona - involved luring women into romantic relationships with an extravagant lifestyle of private jets and luxury holidays.</p>\n    <p>His victims shared their stories in the documentary series, saying they were courted by Leviev with glamorous gifts and getaways to gain their trust.</p>\n    <p>They said Leviev would later pretend he was being pursued by his \"enemies\" and ask them to transfer him significant sums of money, before breaking off all contact.</p>\n    <p>Cecilie Fjellhøy, one of the women featured in the Netflix series, said she gave Leviev more than $270,000 over the course of their relationship.</p>\n    <p>Last year, another woman Iren Tranov, filed a lawsuit against Leviev in Israel for 414,000 shekels (£91,000), saying she lent him more than 144,000 shekels (£31,000) which he never repaid.</p>\n    <p>Leviev previously told BBC Newsbeat he strongly denied the accusations made against him in the documentary.</p>\n    <p>Speaking to the BBC in 2023, Kate Konlin, a former girlfriend of Leviev's, also accused him of emotional and physical abuse while they were together.</p>\n    <p>During an argument, Ms Konlin said he pushed her and she cut her foot on a step with a rough edge.</p>\n    <p>\"I was bleeding. I felt dead. I wanted to kill myself,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>After going to hospital, she filed a complaint against Leviev with the police.</p>\n    <p>Leviev later rejected the accusations and said he had never physically harmed any woman.</p>\n    <p>The Tinder Swindler became Netflix's most-watched documentary in 90 countries when it was released in February 2022.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn95jjn1q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Senate Republicans voted on Monday to confirm a senior Trump official to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors as the White House raced to strengthen the US president’s control over the central bank ahead of its latest meeting.</p>\n    <p>Hours before Fed policymakers convene for their September decision on interest rates, the Senate voted 48 to 27 to confirm Stephen Miran – already chair of Donald Trump’s council of economic advisers – as a governor.</p>\n    <p>The vote concluded just as a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/appeals-court-declines-let-trump-remove-fed-governor-cook-2025-09-16/\">US appeals court</a> declined the Trump administration’s request to fire Lisa Cook, a governor appointed by Joe Biden, before the two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday. The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit means that Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate with interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Start small</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e336/live/2660dc90-8fda-11f0-a984-69b738896393.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A mother organising her child's room, with the cupboard open and items strewn on the floor\"/>\n    <p>The biggest challenge for many is starting the process, so it's important to give yourself permission to declutter.</p>\n    <p>This includes throwing away items, including gifts, that have been kept through a sense of obligation rather than enjoyment.</p>\n    <p>Going slowly is also a must, says writer and Interior Design Masters judge Michelle Ogundehin.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not about thinking 'right, that's it! It's all got to go!' It's about taking it one step at a time,\" she explains.</p>\n    <p>Ogundehin suggests picking an individual drawer or cupboard first, then building up gradually over time. This makes the task feel manageable rather than overwhelming.</p>\n    <h2>2. Plan where to take your items</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c114/live/668c0eb0-8fdb-11f0-a984-69b738896393.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A black woman organising clothes into a donations box\"/>\n    <p>It is essential to plan ahead for what will happen to the items you discard. Ideally this should be <i>before</i> decluttering begins, or within the first few days.</p>\n    <p>\"You don't want to have piles and piles of stuff building up in the hallway,\" says professional organiser Ingrid Jansen.</p>\n    <p>As the co-founder of Declutter Hub, a community of over 60,000 members alongside a weekly podcast, she says there are ever increasing options for items to be donated, recycled, given away or disposed of.</p>\n    <p>Consider charity shops, or giveaway apps like Freegle and Freecycle, or the tip for items which can't be reused.</p>\n    <p>There's also the option to sell items second hand through online marketplaces such as Vinted or eBay.</p>\n    <p>But, fellow Declutter Hub co-founder Lesley Spellman warns that the lure of upselling can be a double-edged sword.</p>\n    <p>Despite our best intentions, it can lead to churning - the habit of packing items for disposal, without actually moving them on.</p>\n    <p>\"Selling is a fantastic way to make money out of your clutter, but you have to exercise some realism,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>If you're that person that's got three bin bags of stuff still under your desk, it may be time to get rid.</p>\n    <h2>3. Prioritise quality not quantity</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6049/live/66ba7c40-8fdc-11f0-b986-51c52739b2d9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A child precariously carrying a pile of shoes to the recycling centre\"/>\n    <p>We've all heard the phrase \"be brutal!\", but effective decluttering doesn't mean discarding things you love for the sake of it.</p>\n    <p>Instead, Ogundehin advises: \"surround yourself with the things that tell the story that you want them to tell\".</p>\n    <p>\"Keep the things that reinforce you, that uplift you when you walk through the door,\" she adds, be that holiday purchases, pictures, or masterpieces by your children, nephews or nieces.</p>\n    <p>Key to managing this is employing what Ogundehin terms \"containment\" - dedicating set spaces for objects, rather than spreading them endlessly throughout your home.</p>\n    <h2>4. Distinguish between nostalgia and sentimentality</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1aee/live/25633b50-8fdd-11f0-b986-51c52739b2d9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A child reading a book to her three giant teddies\"/>\n    <p>Emotional attachment is one of the main reasons people struggle to let go of items.</p>\n    <p>This attachment is often tied to both nostalgia and sentimentality, but these are distinct concepts says psychotherapist Stelios Kiosses, host of Channel 4's The Hoarder Next Door.</p>\n    <p>Sentimentality refers to the emotional value an item holds in the present, often because it symbolises a relationship, achievement, or important moment to us.</p>\n    <p>Nostalgia, meanwhile, is the feeling of longing for the past - with an item triggering memories.</p>\n    <p>\"You become sentimental about your child's toy, but you're nostalgic of the time you used to play with that toy with your child,\" explains Kiosses.</p>\n    <p>Understanding and recognising the difference between the two can be a \"really important\" route to letting go.</p>\n    <p>Take your children's first pair of shoes. \"You think you keep it for them\", Declutter Hub's Jansen adds, \"but actually it's your memory, because you remember going to shops and buying it with them and thinking how cute they looked.\"</p>\n    <p>So, really think about the reasons behind keeping items and whether they'll genuinely be missed by people still around the home.</p>\n    <p>Either way, these days smartphones allow us to take swift mementos. When a picture speaks a thousand words, do we really need to keep everything?</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgen8pkgjjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Watch Trump arrive in New York for his arraignment</p>\n<p>01:18</p>\n<p>What we covered here</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p>Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”</p>\n<p>In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.</p>\n<p>However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.</p>\n<p>The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.</p>\n<p>The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategy</p>\n<p>From CNN's Jeff Zeleny</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.</p>\n<p>But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump, gives an interview outside of Trump Tower on March 21 in New York City.</p>\n<p>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”</p>\n<p>On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.”</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>The former president met with attorneys at Trump Tower on the eve of his arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Kristen Holmes</p>\n<p>From left to right: Susan Necheles, Todd Blanche and Joe Tacopina.</p>\n<p>(Reuters/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>Trump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Photos: Trump arrives in New York City a day before his expected arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Photo Desk</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has landed in New York’s La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse.</p>\n<p>History was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury.

Just 114 days later, they have taken drastic action to avoid a Championship relegation fight.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c80g7ge472mo\">the Blades sacked manager Ruben Selles</a> after losing all six of their games so far in the 2025-26 season.</p>\n    <p>They are bottom of the Championship, below even crisis-hit rivals Sheffield Wednesday. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c7408r78j39t\">A 5-0 loss to Ipswich</a> on Friday means they have conceded 14 goals in those six matches, and have not scored in the league since their opening game.</p>\n    <p>It left Selles' position untenable and he was removed from his position on Sunday morning, with a club statement saying the decision had been made following a \"disappointing start\" to the campaign.</p>\n    <p>To save their season, the Blades have turned to a familiar face. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gq3001pr0o\">Chris Wilder has returned to Bramall Lane</a> for his third spell in charge, capping approximately three months of chaos at the club.</p>\n    <p>\"The owners appear to be admitting defeat, holding their hands up and making amends,\" BBC Sheffield sports editor Rob Staton said. \"It's rare you see that level of humility in football.</p>\n    <p>\"Wilder loves Sheffield United and will be jumping at the chance to get back in and get things going again. He knows the club better than anyone, will be able to walk back in and crack on quickly.</p>\n    <p>\"It's an incredible set of events that will be all the more remarkable if he turns United's season around. There's still plenty of time left to get them up the table.\"</p>\n    <p>Wilder was replaced by Selles in the summer after the 57-year-old Englishman's second stint as Blades boss ended in play-off heartbreak.</p>\n    <p>A total of 92 points from 46 matches in the regular Championship season - with two of those deducted because of previous payment defaults - was only enough for third place last year for Wilder's United, as they finished 10 points off centurions Leeds and Burnley.</p>\n    <p>United thumped Bristol City 6-0 in the play-off semi-finals, and led Sunderland in the Wembley final until the 76th minute. But Tyrese Campbell's opener was cancelled out by Eliezer Mayenda, then in the 95th-minute Tom Watson's winner <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c62vgp6z7q3t\">condemned the Blades to a record 10th failure to earn promotion through the play-offs</a>.</p>\n    <h2>'None of the players they signed have had an impact'</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/165a/live/7c0b6000-918a-11f0-9f13-01e9f580d459.jpg\" alt=\"Ruben Selles \"/>\n    <p>Ruben Selles kept his players on the pitch after they lost to Bristol City in August</p>\n    <p>Wilder exited in June, nearly a month after the play-off final. Selles was announced less than an hour later, after impressing at Reading and Hull previously. But on the pitch it went wrong from the very start.</p>\n    <p>Bristol City, the side Sheffield United beat so comprehensively in the play-offs, thumped them 4-1 at Bramall Lane. Selles gave his players a very public dressing down on the pitch in front of fans after the game.</p>\n    <p>The Blades then lost at Birmingham in the League Cup, before narrow defeats against Swansea, Millwall and league leaders Middlesbrough. The thrashing at Ipswich proved the final straw.</p>\n    <p>Chaos at Sheffield United extends beyond the pitch too. Selles' comments upon taking the Bramall Lane role hinted that rumours of Wilder being uncomfortable with AI-led recruitment models may not have been far off the mark.</p>\n    <p>Selles was the choice of new owners, US-based consortium COH Sports, who completed a long-awaited takeover in December 2024. Wilder signed a new deal soon after, but it does not seem like he was the board's man – although it is hard to know for sure, because they have not yet given any interviews.</p>\n    <p>During the summer, United's spine was ripped out as three key players left - defender Anel Ahmedhodzic, midfielder Vini Souza and striker Kieffer Moore.</p>\n    <p>Coming in the other way were two unknown players from the Bulgarian league, plus young loanees Tyler Bindon and Louie Barry. These were the only men signed before the loss to Bristol City on the opening day.</p>\n    <p>In contrast, the final days of the window were a flurry of action. Experienced striker Danny Ings, Atalanta utility player Ben Godfrey and Millwall defender Japhet Tanganga all arrived.</p>\n    <p>Then on deadline day, four more players were signed including defenders Mark McGuinness and Ben Mee – but former club captain Jack Robinson was allowed to leave for Birmingham.</p>\n    <p>\"There definitely was a plan to use AI and analytics,\" Staton told BBC Sport. \"The argument would be that teams like Brentford have used this for a long time, so it was not that out there.</p>\n    <p>\"But none of the players they have signed have had an impact, and before the window closed they seemed to revert to a conventional policy - signings you would attribute to recruitment staff at the club already.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't know if they have abandoned the AI model, but there has been a shift, and the club have signed players who would appeal to Wilder.\"</p>\n    <h2>'They folded like a pack of cards'</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/62ff/live/b4356d40-918a-11f0-9f13-01e9f580d459.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Ings\"/>\n    <p>Danny Ings was one of several players signed by Sheffield United in the final days of the transfer window</p>\n    <p>Selles was under pressure from the start. One supporter called BBC Radio Sheffield's football phone-in after the opening-day hammering saying the Spaniard should go.</p>\n    <p>By the evening of 12 September, following the 5-0 loss at Ipswich, one caller had become dozens. Selles had lost the fans.</p>\n    <p>\"The tactics didn't work, he was very aggressive with a front-loaded team and one sitting midfielder,\" Staton said of why Selles failed.</p>\n    <p>\"The fans, it went sour immediately and it felt with every passing game it was getting worse. He was given a volley of abuse at Boro. We had a phone-in on Friday and we had fans calling in saying he had to go.\"</p>\n    <p>Selles has been hampered by players who starred under Wilder, like Sydie Peck, Harrison Burrows and Michael Cooper, all losing their form this campaign. Gus Hamer, last year's top player in the Championship, sat on the bench as Ipswich hit United for five, as did key striker Tyrese Campbell.</p>\n    <p>But Staton does not think they downed tools.</p>\n    <p>\"I went to Spain for the training camp, [there was] no hint the players didn't like Selles,\" he said. \"But the body language on the pitch told a different story.</p>\n    <p>\"When they conceded, they folded like a pack of cards - we saw that against Ipswich.\"</p>\n    <p>So 114 days after the play-off final, Sheffield United are heading back to where they started. They will hope it is not too late.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cvg9qrnnem0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kennedy Jr. The vice president also pointed fingers at those he sees as responsible for Kirk's death.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")</p>\n    <p>JD VANCE: We're trying to figure out how to prevent this festering violence that you see on the far left from becoming even more and more mainstream.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: To tell us more about the show and how Charlie Kirk's legacy is being shaped, NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik are both here. Hello to you both.</p>\n    <p>DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there.</p>\n    <p>DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey there.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: Domenico, to start with you, often, in moments of mourning, we hear leaders call for unity. President Trump has not really been focusing on that message in the last few days. Did Vice President Vance today?</p>\n    <p>MONTANARO: Yes and no. I mean, Vance talked about how much he appreciated Democratic colleagues, senators and lawmakers who expressed their sympathy for Vance after Kirk's death because they know that he was close to Kirk. But then Vance closed with a message of action, pointing out that the administration would be going after those that they view as part of a malignant problem, as he called it, on the left when it comes to violence.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")</p>\n    <p>VANCE: There is no unity with people who scream at children over their parents' politics. There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder. There is no unity with someone who harasses an innocent family the day after the father of that family lost a dear friend. There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination.</p>\n    <p>MONTANARO: Now, Vance didn't acknowledge violence toward Democrats, like the murder of a Minnesota state senator and her husband earlier this year or the 2020 plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, or, of course, January 6.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: He also cited polling that he felt backed up his premise that acceptance of violence is more prevalent on the left. You are the person who monitors polls for NPR. What do the numbers actually show?</p>\n    <p>MONTANARO: Yeah, the numbers he cited were coming from YouGov. It was a poll that was taken last week after Kirk's killing. It found 24% of respondents who identified as, quote, \"very liberal\" considered it acceptable for a person to be happy about the death of a public figure they oppose. That's compared to 3% of those who were very conservative. And no doubt, I mean, I found it disturbing that there's been some glee from some corners with progressives online, but we've seen differences in attitudes over the years, depending what's asked and how it's asked.</p>\n    <p>For example, a Public Religion Research Institute poll from last year found that Republicans are far more likely to believe that true American patriots may have to resort to violence to save the country. And a University of Chicago poll from just before the election last year, found a negligible difference between Democrats and Republicans on whether they'd support use of force to either stop Trump from trying to get back to the White House or, on the other side, to help him. You know, so it cuts different ways, but the White House clearly using that first data point as a justification for saying that it's more rampant on the left.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: Turning to you, David, a lot of the vice president's guests assigned blame to the political left. How is that shaping the narrative that forms around Kirk's death and his legacy?</p>\n    <p>FOLKENFLIK: Right, and that takes you beyond the eulogizing of him as a husband, a father, a friend, a political leader in the MAGA right and an adviser, obviously, to the Trump world. You know, in this point, you saw people taking the microphone, essentially, to define the reality, define the legacy and set the tone of what they think should be next. I want to play a clip from you of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. He talked on the show about channeling the anger about Kirk's murder towards rooting out what he called a domestic terror movement on the left.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")</p>\n    <p>STEPHEN MILLER: With God is my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks, and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name.</p>\n    <p>FOLKENFLIK: Making him a kind of martyr for a kind of government-centered vengeance, if we are to take what this powerful White House official says literally. You know, journalism gives you the facts quickly, or tries to, as well as correctly, or it tries its best - can't keep up with speculation, but particularly can't keep up with the digital age, where every opinion somebody might have is rocketed into the ether for us all to absorb. And currently, every framing now from the government comes at us in a variety of ways, including through Charlie Kirk's own show.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: Domenico, what message does it send when the vice president of the United States hosts the radio show and video podcast for Charlie Kirk from the White House?</p>\n    <p>MONTANARO: Yeah, I think it really speaks to the importance of Kirk in MAGA world, you know, not just as an outside operator who helped convince many young voters, young men, in particular, to become Trump voters, but also as an inside political player. Vance said he wouldn't be VP without him. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Kirk organized his endorsement event with Trump and advocated on his behalf to be Health and Human Services secretary. Vance credited Kirk with pushing for White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, for example, to remain as campaign manager when others were calling for her ouster.</p>\n    <p>I think it also speaks to the concern Vance and others have about where the movement goes next. He said, specifically, he's worried about the, quote-unquote, \"talent\" of who would be able to replace Kirk on these college campuses, for example. In other words, who is going to be that person to be able to go and be as effective as he was in this style of combative oppositional dialogue?</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: And briefly, David, how would you answer that from a media perspective?</p>\n    <p>FOLKENFLIK: Well, the thing that I think in terms if you think about rhetoric and what's being conveyed, anyway, is the sense that these were folks who came to power in part 'cause they said we are living in a cancel culture where broad, controversial incendiary remarks - even those of the kinds of Kirk himself - are causing people to be, you know, major lefty institutions in the media to go after them. But right now, what you're hearing is them wanting to go after those who they see as critics of Charlie Kirk and what he represented and what they want to do.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: NPR's David Folkenflik and Domenico Montanaro, thank you both.</p>\n    <p>MONTANARO: You're so welcome.</p>\n    <p>FOLKENFLIK: You bet.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

But he omitted more recent acts of violence targeting Democrats, such as the June attack in Minnesota that killed a Democratic state lawmaker and her spouse, and left another Democratic lawmaker wounded.</p>\n    <p>\"This is not a both-sides problem. If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth we must be told,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Vance said the administration intended to \"go after the NGO network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence,\" though he did not he detail what shape those plans might take.</p>\n    <p>Taking questions from Vance, Miller said the government planned to target what he said were \"the actual organized cells that carry out and facilitate the violence,\" citing people behind doxing campaigns and speech intended to trigger or incite violence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4522x3014+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70%2Fc8%2Ffcb6872a451eb6b5aebf63340331%2Fgettyimages-2234217123.jpg\" alt=\"Air Force Two carrying Vice President JD Vance, with the casket of Charlie Kirk on board, flies past the Utah State Capitol while departing from Salt Lake City International Airport last Thursday.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Air Force Two carrying Vice President JD Vance, with the casket of Charlie Kirk on board, flies past the Utah State Capitol while departing from Salt Lake City International Airport last Thursday.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Patrick T.

Go do it.\"</p>\n    <p>Throughout the show, Vance also spoke of his friendship with Kirk and credited him with helping push for Trump to select him as his vice president. At 41, Vance is the second youngest vice president in U.S. history. He's played an active role in the White House's response to Kirk's death. Last Friday, he transported Kirk's body from Utah back to his home in Arizona, traveling alongside Kirk's widow and family.</p>\n    <h3>Kirk's influence</h3>\n    <p>Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 when he was just 18 years old, meant as a space for young conservatives to turn to at a time when more liberal groups dominated campus life. Since then, the organization has grown significantly, and in the days since Kirk's death, the group has reported an uptick in interest, receiving 37,000 applications to start chapters around the country, according to Andrew Kolvet, the executive producer of <i>The Charlie Kirk Show</i>.</p>\n    <p>As <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5537991/for-charlie-kirks-followers-grief-shock-and-questions-about-the-future\">young conservative organizers and content creators</a> mourn Kirk's death, many say his efforts through Turning Point helped shape their political beliefs.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm a Gen Z conservative, so I was really raised within the MAGA movement. And within the MAGA movement, as a Gen Z conservative, means you're very much a part of the Turning Point USA movement,\" Leavitt, 28, told Vance during her appearance on the show.</p>\n    <p>\"My political education was not just through the rise of President Trump, but also the rise of Charlie Kirk,\" she added.</p>\n    <p>It remains unclear what the future of Turning Point looks like without Kirk, but in her conversation with Vance, Wiles suggested that the vice president, along with Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., stay leading figures in that movement.</p>\n    <p>\"Now we have three and a half years to convert Trump voters to being Republicans so that in 2028 we can keep the White House, the House and the Senate. That's what Charlie helped us think through,\" she said. \"He cannot be replaced by any one person.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5542176/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In August, Trump escalated his fight against the Fed by attempting to fire <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/25/nx-s1-5517335/trump-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook\">governor Lisa Cook</a>, a move that a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5529281/appeals-court-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-independence-trump\">temporarily blocked</a> last week.</p>\n    <p>It's against this backdrop that Fed governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly stepped down last month, opening up a seat on the board that Trump has been so publicly seeking to influence. He quickly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5495582/trump-stephen-miran-federal-reserve-board\">nominated Miran</a>, one of his top economic advisers, to finish the remainder of Kugler's term, which runs through January 2026.</p>\n    <p>The senators voted 48-47 in Miran's favor on Monday. At a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526956/senate-federal-reserve-trump-stephen-miran\">Senate Banking Committee hearing</a> earlier this month, Miran said he would not resign his position as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers if he were confirmed to the role, but would take an unpaid leave of absence.</p>\n    <p>That, coupled with some of his previous writings calling for less independence for the Fed, rattled Democrats in the room.</p>\n    <p>\"Right now, the banking committee should be investigating the president's direct attacks on that independence, not pretending that it's business as usual,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the committee's highest-ranking Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5526013/elizabeth-warren-trump-stephen-miran-fed-independence\">told NPR in September</a>.</p>\n    <p>The committee ultimately voted 13-11 along party lines to advance Miran's nomination to the full Senate. Miran is expected now to join the Fed in time for its highly anticipated two-day meeting on interest rates, which begins Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>\"This is setting us up for a very tight process in advance of a very important central bank meeting,\" Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, told NPR.</p>\n    <p>But critics are worried about more than just the timing. They say his unprecedented plan to take unpaid leave from the White House rather than resign altogether is alarming, warning it could give the president undue influence at the Fed, which is supposed to operate independently of the administration.</p>\n    <p>\"It functionally means he remains a White House employee at the same time as working for the importantly independent Federal Reserve,\" Gilbert said. \"So we're really concerned about this and what it means for the independence of this agency.\"</p>\n    <p>White House spokesperson Kush Desai told NPR in a statement that Miran will take an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisers, have no White House email access, lose his White House badge and \"not provide any advisory guidance as part of CEA in any way.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Instead of resorting to ignorant or intentionally misleading attacks, Democrats and 'nonpartisan' watchdog groups should just admit that Dr. Stephen Miran is eminently qualified to serve on the Fed, and he will do so in compliance with the law,\" Desai wrote.</p>\n    <h3>Who is Stephen Miran?</h3>\n    <p>Miran holds a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. His dissertation advisor was Martin Feldstein, an influential economist who served as Ronald Reagan's chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.</p>\n    <p>Miran graduated in 2010 and began his career in financial markets, working as an analyst for Lily Pond Capital Management, Fidelity Investments and Sovarnum Capital. In 2020, he joined the first Trump administration as a senior advisor to the Department of the Treasury.</p>\n    <p>He left that role after former President Joe Biden was inaugurated and <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amberwave-partners-launches-iusa-exchange-traded-fund-to-drive-investment-in-american-jobs-security-growth-301465014.html\">returned to the private sector</a>, eventually joining Hudson Bay Capital Management and the libertarian-leaning <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/person/stephen-miran\">Manhattan Institute</a>.</p>\n    <p>There, he wrote dozens of op-eds criticizing Biden's economic policy (including the <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/the-inflation-reduction-act-all-for-nothing\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>) and, notably, advocating for a less independent Federal Reserve. The Fed is designed to be independent of the executive branch, though it is accountable to Congress.</p>\n    <p>\"Central bank independence is widely regarded as an essential element of effective economic stewardship,\" Miran <a href=\"https://manhattan.institute/article/reform-the-federal-reserves-governance-to-deliver-better-monetary-outcomes\">wrote in March 2024</a>. \"Yet pure independence is incompatible with a democratic system.\"</p>\n    <p>Miran has proposed controversial reforms such as shortening Fed board members' terms and \"clarifying that members serve at the will of the U.S. president.\" As it stands, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48233#:~:text=Most%20officials%20in%20advice%20and,for%20cause%20by%20the%20President.%22\">Federal Reserve Act</a> requires presidents to demonstrate \"cause\" for removing members before the end of their 14-year terms, which no president has successfully done.</p>\n    <p>Gilbert, of Public Citizen, said the Fed has intentionally been \"kept away from the whims of the White House,\" because it sets monetary policy based on the relative success of the economy — not on politics.</p>\n    <p>\"If you're a president, you might have reason to be touting how the economy is doing as part of a political gambit or something you want to share in an electoral context — not factors that should influence our markets,\" she said.</p>\n    <h3>What has Miran said about his role on the Board?</h3>\n    <p>Trump announced his intention to nominate Miran as his Council of Economic Advisers in December 2024, and the Senate confirmed him in March of this year with a party-line vote. Miran has backed Trump's trade policies and is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-stephen-miran-trump-appointee-federal-reserve-board-governors-2025-8\">widely credited</a> as the architect behind the administration's so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5345802/trump-tariffs-liberation-day\">reciprocal tariffs</a>\" on U.S. trading partners.</p>\n    <p>Trump nominated Miran for the Fed role in early August. At his Senate Banking Committee hearing earlier this month, Miran acknowledged that Trump nominated him \"because I have policy views that I suppose that he liked.\"</p>\n    <p>But, he said, if confirmed, \"I will act independently, as the Federal Reserve always does, based on my own personal analysis of economic data.\"</p>\n    <p>Miran's views on the Fed's independence were called into question at the hearing, when he said he would not resign his White House job if confirmed to the Fed.</p>\n    <p>\"I have received advice from counsel that what is required is an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisers,\" Miran said. \"And so, considering the term for which I'm being nominated is a little bit more than four months, that is what I will be taking.\"</p>\n    <p>That prompted immediate concern from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Sen. Jack Reed, D.-R.I., said Miran's \"independence has already been seriously compromised,\" while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t_umSV-CA4\">Sen. John Kennedy</a>, R-La., asked Miran to commit to \"ignore all the rhetoric from all politicians,\" which he did.</p>\n    <p>In one exchange, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1868238997432467\">Sen. Andy Kim</a>, D-N.J. questioned why Miran wants the Fed job and why he didn't push back on his counsel's advice to take unpaid leave.</p>\n    <p>\"You have every right to say 'No, I'm going to resign.' You can determine your own career — you know that, right?\" Kim asked Miran, who responded affirmatively. \"You could very well be continuing to act in a way that is in the political interest of the president because you know he is going to be your future boss again.\"</p>\n    <p>Miran said that if he were later confirmed to a longer term, he would resign his White House role. Trump said when he nominated Miran that he would continue to search for a nominee to fill a fresh, 14-year term beginning in early 2026.</p>\n    <p>Gilbert said Miran's plans not to resign from the White House are concerning regardless of the length of his Fed term, saying there is a \"slippery slope when it comes to Fed independence.\"</p>\n    <p>She says the conflict of interest is especially worrisome because it's happening at the same time as Trump is trying to remove Cook, another Fed governor. She called the administration's \"attempt to put a finger on the direction of the Fed … obvious and really problematic.\"</p>\n    <p>\"The central bank is intended to keep us stable,\" she told NPR. \"It matters for regular Americans as we think about our economy, as we think about how we are interacting as consumers. And it is simply a problem to have it not be independent.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5542126/stephen-miran-fed-reserve-board\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>'Crisis for PM grows' and Owen Cooper wins Emmy at 15</p>\n    <p>A number of the papers have suggested that there is increasing pressure on the UK prime minister after the resignation of his aide Paul Ovenden following the publication of \"lewd\" WhatsApp messages. The Guardian says that the \"crisis engulfing Keir Starmer has deepened on the eve of Donald Trump's visit to the UK\". A photograph of 15-year-old Owen Cooper holding his Emmy aloft is front and centre for the paper, after the teenager became the youngest male Emmy winner for his starring role in Adolescence.</p>\n    <p>The Metro describes this as Sir Keir's third \"political crisis\" in 10 days, after Downing Street's director of strategy was forced to quit over offensive texts about ex-Labour MP Diane Abbott. The messages were initially reported in the Daily Mail, and are understood to have been made eight years ago, as part of an online private conversation. In a statement. Mr Ovenden said he was \"truly, deeply sorry for it and the hurt it will cause\".</p>\n    <p>\"Starmer fights for his future\" says the i Paper, also leading on the \"embattled\" prime minister's \"fortnight from hell\".</p>\n    <p>\"Mandelson emails add to pressure on Starmer\" declares the Times, alleging that the prime minister knew about the emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein prior to defending him in the Commons. The paper says he will face a three-hour emergency debate on his handling of the scandal, just hours before Donald Trump touches down on UK soil for a state visit. A photograph of Owen Cooper leads the paper, captioned \"Class act\".</p>\n    <p>The US president is expected to \"go easy\" on Starmer according to the Telegraph, despite knowing he is \"on the ropes\". Monday saw the prime minister make his first public comments since sacking Lord Mandelson, and the Telegraph says he \"appeared to blame his advisers\". Sir Keir insisted that he would not resign as he was \"absolutely clear what the task is in front of me\".</p>\n    <p>\"Meltdown!\" warns the Mail, reporting that MPs have said Sir Keir will be \"out by May\" as unrest within the Labour party mounts. Sydney Sweeney is pictured on the front page of the paper, directing readers a story on whether the actress was \"shunned\" at the Emmys over her support of Trump.</p>\n    <p>A Truth Social post from Trump is the main story for the Financial Times, after the president told US companies to stop reporting quarterly results and copy China's \"more long-term approach\". TikTok's long-awaited sale has also made the front page, and the paper reports that a \"framework deal\" has been reached some 18 months after American operations were \"thrown into doubt\". The deal is yet to be approved by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.</p>\n    <p>\"In name of the 97\" reads the headline of the Mirror, reporting on new legislation named after the Hillsborough victims. The law will force public officials to tell the truth during investigations into major disasters. It took 27 years before a court finally ruled that those who died were unlawfully killed, and that the fans who were caught up in the crush bore no responsibility for causing it.</p>\n    <p>\"Millions will face another surge in food bills\" warns the Express, reporting that inflation on food and drink is expected to hit 5.7% by Christmas. The paper says there are fears that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will introduce \"another punishing tax raid\" in her Autumn budget, driving up prices ahead of the holiday season.</p>\n    <p>Prince Harry is pictured on the front page of the Star, after he told the Guardian that he \"didn't air dirty linen\" in his book Spare.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g933zgd49o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The proof is there.</p>\n    <p>\"I like Amorim, with everything he says, he seems to be a likeable man. But unfortunately results paint a picture.</p>\n    <p>\"At this moment in time it isn't good enough. At this moment in time if results don't improve, performances don't really matter that much. He has to win some games or the pressure is going to come on him massively.\"</p>\n    <p>Following last season's struggles, where United finished 15th in the league and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, Amorim worked hard in the summer trying to create a harmonious dressing room culture.</p>\n    <p>While there are some within the United squad who are thought to be uneasy about the 40-year-old's refusal to change his tactics, there is no sign of widespread discontent as yet.</p>\n    <p>The optimism around Amorim is not confined to the Old Trafford boardroom.</p>\n    <p>Joao Noronha Lopes, favourite to win the Benfica presidential election on 25 October, is thought to be keen on bringing him back to the club where he made his name as a player, making 154 appearances across six seasons.</p>\n    <p>Lopes was at Etihad Stadium for Sunday's derby, where he was accompanied by Pedro Ferreira and Nuno Gomes, the former Portugal and Benfica forward, who is one of Amorim's closest friends.</p>\n    <p>Speaking to Portuguese media before the group left for Manchester, Gomes spoke about the prospect of hiring him.</p>\n    <p>\"I can't answer that question,\" he said. \"Ruben Amorim is the coach of Manchester United.</p>\n    <p>\"But one thing I do know, Ruben Amorim will be the coach of Benfica one day.\"</p>\n    <p>Mainoo doesn't have the right partner - Scholes</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cewndg799yro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The incident made him reconsider the years he had spent reporting on the lives cut short by gun violence — and the stress it had put on his body.</p>\n    <p>\"For the first time really, I had to look deep and engage with what was truly bearing down on my heart,\" he says. \"And for me that had been more than a decade of telling stories of Black death and survival.\"</p>\n    <p>As a reporter in Trenton, Philadelphia and New Orleans, Lee covered the deaths of young men who looked like him.

Tears for your death over and over and again.\"</p>\n    <p>Lee's new memoir, <i>A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America</i>, is part history, and part personal turning point. He traces the bloody history Black Americans have with firearms, recalls gun violence in his own youth and follows his ancestors' path back to Ghana. </p>\n    <p>The book reads like a plea for people to see the humanity of those lost to gun violence — and for this country to care enough to act.</p>\n    <p>\"We have an opportunity and we still have this opportunity to be the great nation that we've professed,\" Lee says. \"I'm not a policy maker. I don't profess to be an expert in gun policy. But what I do believe is that until we break our lust for these guns, nothing will change.\"</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1650x2550+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F66%2F8ac03d97466dac0623471ca1c01f%2F9781250098016.jpg\" alt=\"A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America, Trymaine Lee\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On President Trump's comments about the violence in majority-Black cities</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hearing the president talk about Chicago and Baltimore and other cities, and he goes on to talk about how people in these communities were \"<a href=\"https://x.com/barrie4council/status/1963252762944143506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1963252762944143506%7Ctwgr%5E2e3b618ba1118b0fcf9919e8b3992e510e09ea24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fprofessor-why-trumps-born-to-be-criminals-comment-shou-2000060818\">born to be criminal[s</a>].\" The violence is innate, right? There's something in these people that makes them inherently violent, and the gun is just their tool. </p>\n    <p>But I think one of the biggest things that people miss or don't fully understand is that there is a direct pipeline from a slew of places with super lax gun laws that are poured right into Chicago. And that every one of these guns starts legally. And so along the pipeline, from the factory to the wholesale market, to the retail market, to stores, to gun shows, there are all these places where guns are siphoned off by the so-called good guys with guns. And so while there is violence in Chicago and there is criminality in Chicago, there's criminality that happens long before then to allow these guns to pour into these cities in ecosystems and environments already [twisted] and bound by so much systemic violence and so much lack and so much hunger, and so much trauma that folks are carrying.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On speaking to the mothers of Black men and boys who were shot and killed</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There was this string of killings, starting with like Trayvon Martin, and I got close enough to the families where they trusted me to tell their stories. In the middle of all the noise, I had a direct line to most of these families. And the look in a mother's eyes in particular who has lost a son to murder or violence, it's like nothing you've ever seen. And I still see those eyes. I've never been able to remove those eyes, right? The pain that you see in them, the ocean of emotion welling up in them. And that no matter what we do, all the humanizing, all of the, you know, making sense of the systems and the police and the law and all those things will not bring their child back.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the importance of showing respect to the victims of violence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>And the actual process of gathering the information for your report is also tough because you have ask dumb questions. \"What did you see? What did you hear? What was it like the last time you talked to them?\" Questions that are intrusive and at the worst moment in someone's life. And then you're asking for a picture, right? And then, you're over there talking to the police.</p>\n    <p>There's something exploitative by nature: I'm getting so much more out of this than you are. But I always wanted to do it humanely and with great respect. And then you have to take that back to the newsroom. And I literally had an editor once — it was after a shooting and one young person was killed and I think another one was wounded — and he said, \"Oh, that's just a garden-variety killing.\" He described the killing of a young teenager. And mind you, we don't have any context to the situation. ... We don't know how, why, who. We don't anything. But this was so routine that it wasn't worth covering. \"Don't worry about it, it's garden variety.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling with the notion of \"objectivity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The kind of objectivity that we're so often taught in this practice is a blindness. It's like a convenient ignoring of what you actually see. I think what's more appropriate is fairness. And that objectivity in that notion, it's an arm's length from your subject matter. And I never fully believed in that part. I think you have to have your facts right. I think that you have to be fair to people on as many sides as there are. But the notion of objectivity never rang solid for me.</p>\n    <p>What I managed to do, and I hope I continue to do in putting shape to the experiences of people, is going to the people and telling their story as openly and honestly as possible, and painting the picture, and bringing people into their experiences. And even when it's painful, giving a little bit of that pain for everybody to hold. Hold a little of this. If she has to hold some; you have to hold some too.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On tracing a gun from manufacturer to use</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It was so important, I think, to connect the dots between what's happening in factory towns in Massachusetts where these guns are produced, to the communities where these are so easily bought and sold with very little regulation, in the South mostly, to how they end up in Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit and Philadelphia … to show that there is no disconnect, that it's one long string, and that no one is left off of the broad ripple of impact here.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.</p>\n<p>All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.</p>\n<p>This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.</p>\n<p>There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.</p>\n<p>And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.</p>\n<h2>How Windsor became 'Trumpton'</h2>\n<p>For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.</p>\n<p>Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.</p>\n<p>For Palace officials, attention to detail is all.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.</p>\n<p>It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.</p>\n<p>\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider.</p>\n<p>\"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".</p>\n<p>King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.</p>\n<p>Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.</p>\n<h2>'Pressure to make this massive'</h2>\n<p>So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.</p>\n<p>The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.</p>\n<p>\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.</p>\n<p>The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)</p>\n<p>For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"</p>\n<p>Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"</p>\n<h2>The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests</h2>\n<p>Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"</p>\n<p>Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.</p>\n<p>They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.</p>\n<p>\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"</p>\n<p>For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.</p>\n<h2>Serious business behind the pageantry</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Paris St-Germain won last season's tournament - the first to be held using a new expanded format with a 36-team league phase</p>\n<p><strong>BBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty:</strong> My pick to win it are <strong>Liverpool,</strong> purely on the basis of the huge strengthening they have carried out this summer. Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are two high-class players who are Champions League-ready.</p>\n<p>The vagaries of the new league system last season saw Liverpool meet eventual winners PSG in the last 16, where they lost on penalties at Anfield.</p>\n<p>If Liverpool reach the knockout phase, which they surely will, then the Anfield factor grows with every game.</p>\n<p>PSG will be the big danger once again, a superb side who deserve the status as the best team in Europe, while Real Madrid come into every Champions League conversation as potential winners.</p>\n<p><strong>BBC's senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel:</strong> I'm going for <strong>Liverpool.</strong> Four wins from four in the Premier League and they haven't even nearly hit top gear yet. Oh, and Isak is waiting in the wings. Arne Slot's side are the team to beat.</p>\n<p><strong>Former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger:</strong> Real are usually the club with the strongest mentality in this competition, but PSG have to be one of the favourites and Liverpool are too, given that they had such a good Premier League season then invested so much in their squad.</p>\n<p>Those two teams come immediately to mind when I think about who will play in the final, and if I have to pick one to win it then I will go with <strong>Liverpool.</strong> Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.</p>\n<p><strong>BBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray:</strong> When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than <strong>Liverpool.</strong></p>\n<p>Last season they lost out only narrowly to the eventual winners in a penalty shootout. It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.</p>\n<p><strong>Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson:</strong> Tipping <strong>Real Madrid</strong> to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. </p>\n<p>His progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.</p>\n<p><strong>The Observer football correspondent Rory Smith:</strong> It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since <strong>Real Madrid</strong> won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.</p>\n<p><strong>Former England captain Steph Houghton:</strong> I am backing <strong>PSG</strong> to win it again. They are a young squad that has experienced winning already, plus they are athletic and forward thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin:</strong> For a change, I went with my head over my heart. I love <strong>PSG</strong> and the way they play, and the way they have changed the way football is being played now with their attacking attitude. I also love that they love their wingers!</p>\n<p><strong>Spanish football expert Guillem Balague:</strong> I feel <strong>PSG</strong> have started a new era of success that has to do with using cleverly the predominant model of our times - positional football - mixed with quality, clear leadership and top players in each position. </p>\n<p>Barcelona will be close, but I'm not sure they will sort out their defensive deficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c1kwmjxwpkxo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Trump will later travel to Chequers on Thursday for a business reception, working lunch and press conference with Keir Starmer.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, ministers will be hoping that Tuesday’s roundtable with financial bosses from the City and Wall Street will secure further foreign investments that can generate growth and positive headlines before a challenging budget in November.</p>\n    <p>That is expected to include a £100bn investment from Blackstone, the alternative asset manager known for its private equity investments and which manages about $1.2tn (£880bn) worth of assets. It is due to confirm the investment out of the $500bn it is due to invest in Europe over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>Sky News, which broke news of Blackstone’s investment on Monday morning, said the funds would involve private equity buyouts as well as other forms of investment.</p>\n    <p>Blackstone, which is led by Steve Schwarzman, is marking 25 years in London this year, having launched operations in the City in 2000. The office currently employs 650 people, and has about $100bn already invested in the UK. That includes real estate investments, including a datacentre in the north of England. Schwarzman told Bloomberg in June that “the UK government has been really helpful, really focused to make that happen”.</p>\n    <p>Blackstone’s investment pledge will be welcome news, helping to offset challenging decisions in the upcoming autumn budget. Rumours are swirling that the chancellor is considering a number of potential tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental income – in an effort to plug a shortfall of up to £40bn in the public finances.</p>\n    <p>The government has launched a fresh charm offensive to try to keep businesses onside, and Reeves last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/rachel-reeves-tells-private-equity-bosses-she-plans-to-shut-down-more-regulators\">pledged to shut down more regulators across the UK to encourage growth.</a></p>\n    <p>Reeves – who in July claimed regulators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/15/rachel-reeves-rules-red-tape-boot-on-neck-innovation-mansion-house\">were a “boot on the neck” of business</a> – told private equity bosses that there was “still more to do”, having already sacked the chair of the competitions watchdog, shut down the payments regulator and “severely” constrained the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I want to take out more regulators; there’s still too many,” Reeves told investment firms at the British Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association summit in London.</p>\n    <p>The Treasury declined to comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/reeves-to-host-bosses-of-uk-and-us-financial-firms-as-trump-visit-begins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was not a rubber bullet. If you see my son, his head was broken, a hole is there.\" Narendra Shrestha wants to know who will take responsibility for the death of his son Sulov, who was among scores killed in violent unrest that rocked Nepal last week. Mr Shrestha, 45, is perched outside the gates of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital's mortuary in the capital. He's already been inside and identified 21-year-old Sulov's body. \"I want to ask this country,\" he says, choking back tears, \"if they can fire, they can shoot my son, then I and his mother, will also stand. Who will we live for now? We also want to die.\" A female family member sits beside him, holding his hand, while a man protects him from the beating sun with an umbrella. Other families were also waiting to identify their young loved ones whose lives were cut short: one had dreamed of being a judge, another was a student working in a Kathmandu hotel, a third was learning French. They are among more than 70 people who died in anti-corruption protests at the start of last week, which toppled the government of the Himalayan nation. More than 1,000 were injured in the two days of unrest. Pritam Roy Narendra Shrestha says his son was shot in the head: \"Who will we live for now?\" A ban on social media was the impetus for the protests, but anger against government corruption had been building in recent weeks. By the time the ban was reversed late on Monday, 8 September, the protests had swelled into a wider movement. Crowds torched politicians' homes and official buildings as an outpouring of anger at the ruling class boiled over. Many of those killed were shot - police are accused of opening fire on the crowds. But others were burned in fires or died in confrontations with police. Casualty figures have been going up as authorities clean up the debris. In response to the allegations, Nepal's police have said they will investigate what happened during those two days of violent protests. It's still unclear who gave the orders for security forces to open fire. Family handout There are several families like Mr Shrestha's waiting outside the mortuary for their names to be called so they can identify the bodies. One man, Rasik KC, is waiting for the body of his 22-year-old nephew, Rashik Khatiwada. Rashik was shot twice in the chest, Mr KC says. He found out about the death after seeing clips on social media. His anguish has now turned to anger, demanding some kind of accountability from the government. \"We want justice,\" he says. Family handout Abhishek Chaulagain, 22, was shot in the forehead The BBC spoke with more than a dozen people who lost family members in the protests. The relatives of Subash Bohora, 21, said there was a time in his life when he wanted to be a judge. He died outside Nepal's parliament building after a bullet pierced his neck. Ayush Thapa, 19, was a French language student who was interested in the British Army and hated Nepali politicians, his family says. He was shot in the chest. Abishek Chaulagain, 22, was a student working in one of the capital's hotels when he was shot in the forehead. \"We had never come across a disaster like this,\" says Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu. She says they treated more than 450 patients in their emergency room during the protests. Six people died. \"Our hospital [has been] in operation for 17 years. We were able to manage patients during the earthquake. [This] situation was worse.\" On the first night of protests, Dr Santosh Paudel was working at Bir Hospital, not far from the parliament building. Of the 173 patients his team treated in the hospital's emergency ward, five died and four are still in critical condition. Dr Paudel says he was surprised to see patients with \"sharp rifle injuries\" in addition to rubber bullets. \"We saw [two types of bullets] clearly, the long one, which is fired by shotguns, and the small ones with the sharp edge that is fired from rifles,\" said Dr Paudel. He said many of the patients that came later in the day had multiple bullet injuries. Pritam Roy Parliament was attacked and images of it set ablaze were seen around the world Protests began last Monday when thousands heeded a call by demonstrators describing themselves as Generation Z to gather near parliament in Kathmandu over the decision to ban platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, as well as over wider dissatisfaction with the government. Ministers said police had to use force, which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Saying they'd failed to register locally, the government announced social media platforms needed to be regulated to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. But popular platforms such as Instagram have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business – and protesters accused the government of trying to silence them. By Tuesday, violent crowds were setting fire to government buildings in the capital Kathmandu. Parliament was torched even though Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already resigned. Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki has a tough road ahead. Not only does the 73-year-old former chief justice need to appoint a new cabinet, she must rebuild confidence in the country's leadership. She has agreed to fresh elections on 5 March 2026, but the first real test of her new government will be her investigation into the protests and if she can bring the perpetrators of the deadly violence – including those who shot protesters, as well as those behind the widespread vandalism – to justice. Pritam Roy \"International law says they are not allowed to shoot,\" says Abishek Shrestha, 22, from his hospital bed, his home for the next month. Metal rods protrude from the white and pink gauze wrapped around his right leg, where he was shot. \"I'm Nepali and they are not allowed to shoot me, but they shot me. It's all because of the government, police, rules and regulation. We have to change this.\" An investigation is little comfort to Mr Shrestha as he mourns Sulov. \"Politicians, they will say sorry. Sorry doesn't make a dead son come alive again.\" Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated Asia Nepal Related Private zoo run by billionaire Ambani family cleared of 'foul play' India's top court suspends parts of contentious Muslim property law Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager More from the BBC 1 day ago Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Sushila Karki said the government must heed protesters' demands for \"an end to corruption, good governance and economic equality\". 1 day ago 2 days ago Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated The House of Representatives was dissolved by the country's president, following deadly anti-corruption protests. 2 days ago 3 days ago Nepal gets first female PM after deadly unrest Former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki is sworn in after a deal with protest leaders. 3 days ago 4 days ago Worried migrants head home from India after Nepal turmoil Nepalis rush home from India as deadly protests have engulfed the Himalayan nation. 4 days ago 4 days ago See Kathmandu's destroyed and barricaded streets after violence There's an intense military presence on the Nepali capital's streets, says the BBC's Samira Hussain. 4 days ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

Is it approaching a \"South Africa moment\", when a combination of political pressure, economic, sporting and cultural boycotts helped to force Pretoria to abandon apartheid? Or can the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu weather the diplomatic storm, leaving Israel free to pursue its goals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank without causing permanent damage to its international standing? Two former prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have already accused Netanyahu of turning Israel into an international pariah. Thanks to a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, the number of countries Netanyahu can travel to without the risk of being arrested has shrunk dramatically. At the UN, several countries, including Britain, France, Australia, Belgium and Canada, have said they are planning to recognise Palestine as a state next week. And Gulf countries, reacting with fury to last Tuesday's Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar , have been meeting in Doha to discuss a unified response, with some calling on countries which enjoy relations with Israel to think again. But with images of starvation emerging from Gaza over the summer and the Israeli army poised to invade - and quite possibly destroy - Gaza City, more and more European governments are showing their displeasure in ways that go beyond mere statements. Even Netanyahu admitted on Monday that Israel is facing \"a kind of\" economic isolation on the world stage. Speaking at a finance ministry conference in Jerusalem, he blamed the isolation on negative publicity abroad, and said Israel needed to invest in \"influence operations\" in traditional and social media to counteract it. Reuters The Israeli military is continuing with its offensive in Gaza despite international condemnation At the start of the month, Belgium announced a series of sanctions, including a ban on imports from illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a review of procurement policies with Israeli companies and restrictions on consular assistance to Belgians living in settlements. It also declared two hardline Israeli government ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, persona non grata, along with Jewish settlers accused of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Other countries, including Britain and France, had already taken similar steps. But sanctions on violent settlers imposed by the Biden administration last year were scrapped on Donald Trump's first day back in the White House. A week after Belgium's move, Spain announced its own measures, turning an existing de facto arms embargo into law, announcing a partial import ban, barring entry to Spanish territory for anyone involved in genocide or war crimes in Gaza, and prohibiting Israel-bound ships and aircraft carrying weapons from docking at Spanish ports or entering its airspace. Israel's combative foreign minister, Gideon Saar, accused Spain of advancing antisemitic policies and suggested that Spain would suffer more than Israel from the arms trade ban. EPA Some countries have sought to target far-right Israeli lawmakers Itamar Ben-Gvir (l) and Bezalel Smotrich But there are other alarming signs for Israel. In August, Norway's vast $2tn (1.7tn euros; £1.6tn) sovereign wealth fund announced it would start divesting from companies listed in Israel. By the middle of the month, 23 companies had been removed and finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said more could follow. Meanwhile, the EU, Israel's largest trading partner, plans to sanction far-right ministers and partly suspend trade elements of its association agreement with Israel. In her 10 September State of the Union speech, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said events in Gaza had \"shaken the conscience of the world\". A day later, 314 former European diplomats and officials wrote to von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas calling for tougher measures, including a full suspension of the association agreement. One feature of the sanctions levelled at South Africa between the 1960s and the end of apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority - in the 1990s was a series of cultural and sporting boycotts. Again, there are signs of this starting to happen with Israel. The Eurovision Song Contest might not sound like a significant event in this context, but Israel has a long and illustrious history with the competition, winning it four times since 1973. For Israel, participation is symbolic of the Jewish state's acceptance among the family of nations. But Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia have all said, or hinted, that they will withdraw in 2026 if Israel is allowed to compete , with a decision expected in December. EPA Israel has been a Eurovision regular since the 1970s but some countries have threatened to boycott next year's competition In Hollywood, a letter calling for a boycott of Israeli production companies, festivals and broadcasters \"that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people\" has attracted more than 4,000 signatures in a week, including household names like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem. Tzvika Gottlieb, CEO of the Israeli Film and TV Producers Association, called the petition \"profoundly misguided\". \"By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us,\" he said. Then there is sport. The Vuelta de Espana cycling race was repeatedly disrupted by groups protesting the presence of the Israel-Premier Tech team, forcing a messy, premature end on Saturday and the cancellation of the podium ceremony. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called the protests a source of \"pride\", but opposition politicians said government actions had caused international embarrassment. Also in Spain, seven Israeli chess players withdrew from a tournament after being told they would not be able to compete under their flag. The Israeli government's response to what the media have already dubbed a \"diplomatic tsunami\" has generally been defiant. Netanyahu accused Spain of a \"blatant genocidal threat\" after its prime minister said his country, lacking nuclear bombs, aircraft carriers or large oil reserves, was not able to stop Israel's offensive in Gaza by itself. After Belgium announced its sanctions, Gideon Saar wrote on X that it was \"regrettable that even when Israel is fighting an existential threat, which is in Europe's vital interest, there are those who can't resist their anti-Israeli obsession\". On Monday, Netanuahu said that Israel should reduce the dependence of its industries on trade with other countries, including arms and other defence products. \"We might find ourselves blocked not only in R&D but also in actual industrial production,\" he said. \"We must start developing our capabilities to rely more on ourselves.\" Reuters The Vuelta, one of cycling's major annual races, was repeatedly disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests But among those who have represented Israel abroad, there is deep anxiety. Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel's ambassador to Germany from 2017 to 2021, told me he could not recall a time when Israel's international standing was so \"impaired\", but said some measures were \"highly objectionable\" because they target all Israelis. \"Instead of singling out the policies of the government, this is alienating a lot of moderate Israelis in the middle ground,\" he said. He said some steps, like recognising the state of Palestine, were likely to prove counterproductive, as it \"gives ammunition to people like Smotrich and Ben Gvir and even enhances their argument to annex [the West Bank]\". Despite his fears, the former ambassador does not believe Israel's diplomatic isolation is irreversible. \"We're not in a South African moment, but we're in a possible preamble to a South African moment,\" he said. Others believe more profound change is needed to halt Israel's slide towards pariah status. \"We have to regain our place in the family of nations,\" another former diplomat, Ilan Baruch, told me. \"We need to get back to our senses.\" Baruch, who was ambassador in South Africa a decade after the end of apartheid, resigned from the diplomatic service in 2011, saying he was no longer able to defend Israel's occupation. Since retiring, he's been a vocal critic of the government and supporter of a two-state solution. He believes recent sanctions are necessary, saying: \"That's how South Africa was pushed to its knees.\" Reuters Israel maintains the backing of the US, whose Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting this week Baruch continued: \"I would say that assertive pressure on Israel in any way the Europeans believe is at their disposal should be welcome.\" If necessary, he said, this should include changes to visa regimes and cultural boycotts, adding: \"I'm prepared for the pain.\" But for all the expressions of outrage and talk of pressure, some veteran observers doubt Israel is on the edge of a diplomatic precipice. \"Those who are willing to go down the Spanish route are still outliers,\" Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, told me. He said efforts to take collective action within the EU – scrapping elements of the association agreement or even, as some have suggested, freezing Israel out of the EU's Horizon research and innovation programme – are unlikely to garner sufficient support, with Germany, Italy and Hungary among members resisting such moves. Israel also still has the staunch backing of the US, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Washington's \"relationship with Israel is going to remain strong\" as he departed for an official visit. Levy still believes Israel's international isolation is \"irreversible\" but says the Trump administration's continued support means it has not yet reached the point where it can change the course of events in Gaza. \"Netanyahu is running out of road,\" Levy said. \"But we haven't hit the end of the road yet.\" Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders 'Netanyahu, we're not leaving': Defiance in Gaza City as Israel shows aid sites planned for evacuees Bowen: Diplomacy in ruins after Israel strikes Hamas leaders in Qatar Middle East Israel-Gaza war Israel Benjamin Netanyahu Related Qatar hosts Arab-Islamic emergency summit over Israeli strike on Doha Rubio in Israel as IDF destroys more Gaza City buildings Greta Thunberg's Gaza flotilla hit by drones, organisers claim More from the BBC 3 hrs ago Critically ill children arrive in Scotland from Gaza The Scottish government has committed to supporting the treatment of up to 20 Palestinian youngsters. 3 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Israel demolishes more high-rise towers as Gaza City offensive ramps up BBC Verify's Merlyn Thomas looks at the latest Israeli strikes on buildings in Gaza City city over the weekend. 5 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders At a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\". 5 hrs ago 6 hrs ago Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sport Pedro Sánchez says Israel should be treated in the same way as Russia over its war in Ukraine. 6 hrs ago 1 day ago Netanyahu is only obstacle to bringing hostages home, families say Their intervention comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives in Israel to meet the Israeli PM. 1 day ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects. \"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company. He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs. \"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\" Bloomberg via Getty Images American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, in part due to economic tensions with China His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops. American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July. With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening. Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis. Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular. 'I'm in a little bit of a worried place:' Tim Maxwell owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa Mr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says. \"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\" So why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy? Farmers on a 'trade and financial precipice' If you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days. There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar. But when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs. Anna Jones at the Iowa State Fair where there was much talk about the impact of tariffs \"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine. \"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\" In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China. In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China. Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock. September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year. The Iowa State Fair attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. \"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\" The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser. Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States… \"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke. \"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\" Farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", sell a huge number of crops to China American farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency. In a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\" Trump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day' Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture. And they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance. In his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\" Getty Images Supporters of Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\". \"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\" And it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. But he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts. \"That is a problem.\" Tariffs will make us great again There's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances. Yet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump. Experts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole. Though a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small. \"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics. At Iowa's State Fair, many of the conversations revolved around Trump and tariffs (pictured: attendee John Wilson with Judah the Big Ram) For some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run. \"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa. \"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\" Some may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China. A case of selective blame attribution? For Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play. \"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\" Starting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change. What he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\". Bloomberg via Getty Images Rural America: the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump, says one expert Some repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\". \"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". Ms Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\" Prof Shepherd, of the University of Michigan, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side. He calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\" 'We're giving him a chance - there'd better be results' Mr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\" But he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return. Many of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support. 'A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,' farmer Gil Gullickson (left). 'But history proves that tariffs don't end well' Mr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under. Back at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear. \"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less. \"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\" Listen to Corn Belt People on BBC Radio 4 at 4pm bst on Monday 15 September Additional reporting: Florence Freeman Trump is used to shaking off criticism - but the Epstein story is different The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation How Trump is using the courts to get what he wants - and changing the shape of presidential power Trump tariffs Agriculture Iowa Rural life Donald Trump US politics Related China accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly laws Brazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffs AstraZeneca pauses £200m Cambridge investment More from the BBC 3 hrs ago Marine officers search river ahead of Trump visit Specialist marine officers increase patrols ahead of the US president's visit to Windsor. 3 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Trump renews push to end companies' quarterly reports The US president urges regulators to adopt a semi-annual schedule for financial reports. 5 hrs ago 6 hrs ago Democratic New York governor endorses Zohran Mamdani for NYC mayor Some establishment Democrats have been uneasy about the 33-year-old's left-wing platform. 6 hrs ago 7 hrs ago Trump says Venezuela 'sending drugs, gang members' as tensions rise Tension has been running high between the two countries since the US deployed war ships to the South Caribbean. 7 hrs ago 12 hrs ago Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 12 hrs ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

Here's how to fix it 21 hours ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save BBC When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks. Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode. This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness. Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, and conditions such as long Covid and autoimmune conditions like lupus disease, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind at once. Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze. 1. Be kind to yourself Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping. Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched. Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it. If you are concerned then you should contact your GP. 2. Create routines Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory. Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\" It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making. 3. Take breaks Getty Images Taking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focus It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room. But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely. Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly. Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next. 4. Use calendars and reminders Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness. Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space. Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores. This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\" Swans Getty Images Staying hydrated and eating whole foods can help clear brain fog Alongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen focus. Each letter stands for a key habit that can help clear the mental mist and keep your mind performing at its best: Sleep: Sleep is non-negotiable - it gives your brain time to rest and consolidate memories. Aim for between seven and nine hours each night. Water: Our bodies are about 60% water and even mild dehydration can make you feel unfocused so keep water nearby and sip it regularly Activity : Moving your body boosts blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps you think more clearly. Try going on short walks, a light jog or regularly stretching Nutrition: Nourish your brain with whole foods rather than processed ones. Choline is a nutrient vital for brain health so eating food that is rich in it like eggs, fish and nuts can support concentration and focus. Stress: Chronic stress floods the body with cortisol - a hormone that helps regulate your body's response to stress - and that can cloud your thinking. Find ways to lower stress through breathing exercises, mindfulness and hobbies. Use the NHS website to find out more about brain fog and how to manage it. Feeling stressed?

Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request. Outside of the UK you can watch on YouTube One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her. Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations. Warsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022 Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business. Mr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver \"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run. Troy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa He says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022. Instagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died Monic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation. Instagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building Kayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us. Monic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life For Monic's family, grief is now tangled with fear. Fear for other families who could suffer the same loss they have, if nothing is done. \"We are all looking at Monica's death,\" her relative Michael told us. \"But who is there for the girls still alive? They're still there. Still suffering.\" The BBC asked Charles \"Abbey\" Mwesigwa to respond to all the allegations made in our investigation. He denied running an illegal prostitution ring. He said: \"These are all false allegations. \"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it.\" He also said: \"[Monic] died with her passport meaning no-one was demanding her money for taking her. Prior to her death, I hadn't seen her for over four to five weeks. \"I knew [Monic and Kayla] and [they] were renting with different landlords. If no-one in both flats was arrested or any of the landlords, then there was a reason. Both incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and maybe they can help you.\" The BBC contacted Al Barsha Police Station to request to see the case files for Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi. It did not respond to that request or to allegations Monica and Kayla's deaths had not been properly investigated. The BBC was unable to see any toxicology reports in relation to Monic Karungi, or speak to the landlord of the apartment in which she was living when she died.

Soldiers from the Royal Dragoon Guard, of which she had been deputy colonel-in-chief, carried the coffin from the royal hearse into the cathedral. The hearse had brought the coffin, draped in the royal standard, from Kensington Palace where the duchess died aged 92 earlier this month, with a piper playing as the hearse left. Her immediate family, including her widower the Duke of Kent and their three children, were there and attended a service marking the reception of the duchess' coffin into the cathedral, which is part of the traditional Roman Catholic funeral tradition. PA Media The royal hearse had brought the coffin from Kensington Palace to the cathedral The King and Queen and other senior royals will attend Tuesday's Requiem Mass at the cathedral, the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in Britain's modern history. Music will include Ave Verum Corpus by Mozart, which was selected by the duchess as her favourite piece when she was a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs in 1990. A piper will play the lament Sleep, Dearie, Sleep, which was played at the funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II. With her family proud of their Yorkshire connections, the wreath on the coffin includes white roses, the emblem of Yorkshire; sprigs of yew from the gardens of Hovingham Hall, her family's home; and other flowers and herbs such as rosemary for remembrance. The duchess, married to the late Queen's first cousin, had been the oldest member of the Royal Family when she died. Many tributes have been paid to her, including from the Prince and Princess of Wales who said she had \"worked tirelessly to help others and supported many causes, including through her love of music\". The duchess had become a primary school music teacher, calling herself Mrs Kent, with the pupils not knowing anything about her royal life. She will also be remembered as a familiar figure at the Wimbledon tennis championships, where she handed over trophies - and consoled those who had lost, including a tearful Jana Novotna in 1993. The coffin will remain in the cathedral's Lady Chapel overnight. The funeral on Tuesday afternoon will be a private family service, after which the coffin will be taken to the royal burial ground in Frogmore in Windsor.

Girl with Balloon, valued at £270,000, was taken from the Grove Gallery in central London in September last year. James Love, 54, who hid the work after another man had smashed through the door of the gallery, wanted the Banksy \"on his walls\", jurors were told. The limited edition print was recovered by the Met Police when Mr Love told them where to find it. PA Media Larry Fraser has already admitted smashing into the gallery and taking the print Kingston Crown Court heard the other man, 48-year-old Larry Fraser, had already pleaded guilty to burglary. Prosecution barrister Philip Stott said Mr Love was a \"relatively successful builder\" whereas Fraser was \"impoverished\" and only had £1.75 in his bank account the day before the theft. Mr Love had transferred £200 to Fraser on the day of the offence, Mr Stott said. On the evening the Banksy was taken, the mobile phones of both men were being used in the vicinity of the gallery, the jury was told, and Fraser is said to have called Mr Love minutes after smashing the gallery doors and taking the painting. After leaving the gallery, Fraser took the print into a nearby property where he left the artwork and changed his top, the trial heard. Soon after, the night watchman at the building was \"startled\" to find a \"large painting\" by an interior doorway and had \"no idea how it had got there because it hadn't been there when he walked past the same spot earlier that evening\", Mr Stott said. He claimed the duo pushed past the night watchman, collected the artwork and drove to a block of flats in the Isle of Dogs where Mr Love unloaded the Banksy. Love heart collection Mr Stott said there was a \"relatively large number of pictures, about four, featuring love hearts\" on the walls of Mr Love's home and that the stolen work was \"consistent with those others\". \"Given that it was Mr Love who had multiple pieces of art based on love hearts already on his walls, it was likely stolen with a view to it eventually, when the heat had died down, ending up in the same place.\" Mr Love, of North Stifford, Grays, Essex denies burglary, and the trial continues.

More than 2,200 people, from 27 countries, attended this year's event on the tiny island of Easdale off the west coast of Scotland. Rules state that stones must come from naturally occurring island slate, however some were found to have been ground into a \"suspiciously circular\" shape to help them bounce on water. Organiser Dr Kyle Mathews told BBC News that the offenders had \"held their hands up\" and apologised. Entrants choose their own stones and judges use a measuring device, the \"ring of truth\", to ensure they are no bigger than three inches in diameter. Each competitor is allowed three skims and stones must bounce at least twice on water before sinking. Getty Images Stones are measured by judges using the \"ring of truth\" Dr Matthews, also known as the \"Toss Master\", told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that judges heard \"rumours and murmurings of some nefarious deeds\". \"There was a little bit of stone doctoring,\" he said. \"They had shaped it so that it was perfectly circular and fitted our three inch measurer. \"As it's a piece of metal, I don't think we can blame it too much. \"The problem was we didn't just notice at the time that they were suspiciously circular.\" AFP via Getty Images The rules state stones can only be picked from naturally occurring slate World Stone Skimming Championships Jonathan Jennings was the overall winner of this year's event Dr Matthews said lessons had been learned and they would \"move on to an even greater event next year\". Entrant Jonathan Jennings went on to victory last week as the contest's first American winner, skimming his stones a cumulative distance of 177m. The event was first organised in 1983 by island resident Albert Baker and after a break was revived in 1997 by community group Eilean Eisdeal. The contest is staged in a former slate quarry that was flooded by a tidal wave in 1881. It is run by volunteers and the proceeds support local community projects and charities. Last year it raised £15,000. Easdale is the smallest permanently inhabited island of the Inner Hebrides with a population of about 60 people.

Lauren King, whose six-year-old Bebe King was the youngest of three children murdered in the attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July 2024, told the hearing at Liverpool Town Hall that the inquiry needed to \"face the truth\" and deliver \"real change\". The inquiry - set up to examine the history of their killer and his contact with various agencies - also heard from the parents of Alice Aguiar, nine, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven. They described how their lives had been shattered by the loss of their beloved daughters. Warning: This report contains distressing information Eight other children and two adults were seriously wounded during the attack at a dance studio in Hart Street. Earlier this month, the inquiry heard evidence from some of those who had survived. Family photos Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Aguiar were murdered in the attack on 29 July 2024 Monday had been earmarked as a day for the parents of the three murdered girls to address the inquiry. Jenni and David Stancombe, Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar, and Lauren and Ben King all fought through tears and sat side-by-side in the witness box as their statements were delivered. Mrs King, 42, described Bebe as \"joyful\", \"hilarious\" and \"magical\", and said her bond with her daughter had been \"spiritual\". Her voice rose in anger as she demanded \"accountability\". \"This was preventable,\" she said. \"And no other child, no other family, no other community should ever endure what we now live with every single day.\" She described the desperate hours after she and Mr King were told a man had attacked the dance studio - including \"hours walking around in the intense heat\" not knowing whether Bebe was alive. Mrs King said they had been standing in the street, in public, when they were first told Bebe had been killed. \"These are moments no form of therapy can ever resolve,\" she said. PA Media The parents of the three girls murdered on 29 July 2024 gave evidence at a public inquiry She finished by telling the inquiry: \"We will carry her in our hearts for the rest of our lives. \"But those sitting here today carry a responsibility too: to make sure no other child, no other sister, no other family ever suffers what ours has suffered.\" Earlier, a statement from Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar, read by their lawyer Chris Walker, described how their \"little family unit\" had been destroyed when their only daughter was killed. Mrs Aguiar, 34, described a scene of \"panic and terror\" when she arrived to collect Alice. She described \"injured little girls\" all over the car park. She ran into the building, where the killer was still being detained by police, the inquiry heard. \"I saw devastation everywhere, blood smeared on the walls, cries and sobs of little girls in fear and agony from their wounds,\" she said. PA Media Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar (centre) told the inquiry of the scenes of \"panic and terror\" on Hart Street Mrs Aguiar said she had found her daughter outside, where paramedics were tending to her injuries. \"My happy, loving, innocent little girl [was] hurt by a monster,\" she said. Alice was taken to Southport hospital where, after 13 hours, Mr and Mrs Aguiar were told she had not survived her wounds. \"We just hope that she couldn't feel any pain and that she wasn't scared,\" Mrs Aguiar wrote. \"This haunts us both. We live with this thought most days now.\" Jenni Stancombe, 37, told the inquiry her daughter Elsie was \"our joy, our pride, our everything\", adding: \"She just radiated warmth and love to everyone around her.\" She told the inquiry her daughter's death could not be categorised simply as \"knife crime\". \"The issue runs much deeper than the weapon that was used,\" she said. \"It's about the root causes, the drive, the intent, and the series of failures that allowed it to happen.\" PA Media Jenni Stancombe (left) and David Stancombe (right) said their daughter's death could not simply be defined as \"knife crime\". Mrs Stancombe recalled the moment they had received a call to say a man had attacked the dance class, and how they had driven to the scene in their car before abandoning it in the middle of the road. She said two police officers had had to lift Mr Stancombe off his feet to stop him running inside the building. She said they had been able to see the \"devastation\" caused as they searched among the other wounded girls for Elsie. \"What we saw that day will stay with us for the rest of our lives,\" Mrs Stancombe told the inquiry. \"Out of respect for the other victims, I will not go into detail, but it goes without saying; no human being should ever witness what we did that day.\" She said after they had described Elsie's clothing, a police officer confirmed a child inside the building fitting that description \"hadn't made it\". \"David knelt down in front of me and just looked at me. I didn't believe them. I didn't want to believe them,\" she said. \"Elsie's life was stolen, robbed in the most traumatic way.\" The inquiry continues.

Leroy Douglas, 44, was handed a minimum term of two-and-a-half years in 2005 for robbery, but remains in custody as he is subject to an indeterminate sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). The controversial measure was scrapped in 2012 , but campaigners are calling for those currently serving an IPP to be resentenced and have filed a case against the UK before the United Nations. The Ministry of Justice said it released the highest annual number of IPP prisoners on record last year with additional support given to those in custody. Man still in jail 20 years after laptop robbery 'My brother will die in jail without law change' Prison crisis will 'force' indeterminate sentence change IPPs are a type of sentence which means inmates can be detained indefinitely if the parole board decides it is not safe to release them . They were designed to detain offenders who posed a \"significant\" risk of causing serious harm to the public, but faced criticism after being handed out for less serious crimes. Defendants must serve a minimum term before being considered for release by the parole board but this is not automatic. They are also subject to licence conditions which they must follow or risk being recalled to prison once they are released. Anthony Douglas, 63, said his son was a \"normal kid\" growing up who was \"easily led\" to make bad decisions. He said Leroy Douglas, who is now in HMP Stocken in Stretton, Rutland started to get into trouble along with friends and received convictions for crimes including for shoplifting as a teenager and young man. However, he said it \"all escalated\" when the dad-of-two was sentenced for stealing a mobile phone belonging to his cousin's boyfriend in 2005. Instead of a fixed term two and a half year custody sentence, he was handed an IPP, which his family said was a \"shock to everyone\". \"He got two-and-a-half years and the next thing I know is that he's still in there all these years later,\" Mr Douglas said. \"I expected him to do half of the two-and-a-half years and start fresh again.\" Family photo Leroy, pictured with his sister Natalie, was a typical child before he started getting into trouble Mr Douglas has not been able to make the journey to visit his son in person since he was sentenced, but speaks to him regularly on the phone. While in custody, Leroy Douglas had to be told of his daughter's death after she suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage aged 20, as well as losing his grandparents and other family members, something which his dad said had affected his mental health. According to Mr Douglas he has been moved to different facilities a number of times, which has resulted in him having to repeat training and courses needed for him to be considered for release. \"We are not the only ones suffering, the whole family is with him being in prison,\" he said. Mr Douglas admitted his son had struggled with poor behaviour while in custody, but said being in a prison environment from a young age had created the \"product that he is today\". \"His family is outside, so inside the only role models he's got are those who are already in prison,\" he said. \"He started to act out because he doesn't think it's fair that he's been kept in there that long, so that's had an impact on his behaviour.\" While Leroy Douglas has suffered with addiction in the past, his dad said he had tested negative for drugs while in prison. Natalie Douglas Natalie and Anthony say Leroy has had to deal with losing loved ones while in prison Andrew Taylor, criminal barrister at Apex Chambers, has represented about 10 clients who were given IPP sentences. He described the situation as \"draconian and unfair\". \"I've had clients who on the face of it without IPP sentences might have faced fixed term sentences of four or five years which gives them a definite release date,\" he said. \"But if you have an IPP it's effectively for life. Many subjected to them get recalled sometimes for the most minor sentences.\" Mr Taylor said there needed to be a \"large scale resentencing\" of people who were subject to IPPs. While he said not all those subject to them would otherwise have been released immediately, \"there was no longer a need to have people locked up like this\". \"These people become hopeless, they have no hope on getting out which can lead to violent behaviour in prisons, and we have a radical shortage of prison spaces,\" he said. \"The first aim of prison should be rehabilitation, and IPP sentences go against that.\" Family handout Anthony Douglas says his son's IPP sentence has affected the whole family Figures from June show there are about 2,500 prisoners who have either never been released or have been recalled to prison under the IPP scheme. On Thursday campaigners from Wales, including Shirley Debono whose son Shaun Lloyd was handed an IPP sentence aged 18 , went to Downing Street to hand over a letter calling for the sentences to be abolished retrospectively, and for those still affected to be resentenced. The group have also filed a case against the UK government before the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. In the letter, the campaigners urged the government to \"do the right thing by ending one of the greatest miscarriages of justice and restore hope and justice to thousands of IPP prisoners and their families\". The added children had \"grown up separated from their parents, not knowing when or if they will ever see them again\". According to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data, the number of people released from prison but living with an IPP has been cut from from 3,018 to 1,134 between December 2023 and March 2025. A total of 602 recalled IPP prisoners were released from custody in the past 12 months, the highest number of annual releases on record. The MoJ said: \"We are determined to make progress towards safe and sustainable releases for those in prison, but not in a way that undermines public protection.\" Wrongly jailed man loses prison stay refund appeal Why are wrongfully convicted prisoners charged jail costs?

Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US on Thursday over his links to the late convicted paedophile. The government said the \"depth and extent\" of Mandelson's relationship with the financier had not been known when he was appointed last year. This is the first time financial evidence of Epstein paying for Mandelson's travel has come to light. The BBC has contacted Mandelson for a response. Just months after Mandelson contributed a 10-page note to Epstein's 2003 \"50th birthday book\", in which he referred to Epstein as his \"best pal\" , Epstein paid for Mandelson's travel. It is unclear where and when Mandelson's travel took place. The first travel payment by Epstein is dated 4 April 2003 - before he was convicted in 2008 - and cost $3,844.90. A week later, Epstein paid a further $3,642.06. The travel receipts were among more than the 33,000 Epstein-related records released earlier this month by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee, provided by the Department of Justice. The documents show Epstein's financial account with a New York travel agent, Shoppers Travel Inc, which was used by Epstein to book commercial flights for his associates and employees. Victims also allege to have been flown commercially by Epstein in this way. In emails from October 2005, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, Mandelson is said to have complained to Epstein about a lack of British Airways airmiles and Epstein offered to pay for his Caribbean flight. Mandelson is reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The Labour peer and former cabinet minister also told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before he began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Mandelson does not deny these emails. In a previous statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\" In a letter Mandelson wrote to staff at the British embassy in Washington after being sacked, he said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

Sources stressed Sir Keir was not aware of the contents of the emails when he stood by Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The BBC understands that a media enquiry outlining details of the messages between the pair was sent to the Foreign Office on Tuesday, and passed on to No 10. Sir Oliver Robbins, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, asked Lord Mandelson about the emails on Tuesday but did not receive a response until the next day. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of lying to the public. She said: \"Looks like the prime minister and Labour MPs spent the week lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson's involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"If No10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement\". Backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake called No 10's reported handling of the situation \"really embarrassing\". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: \"Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails were presented to them clearly has deep failings.\" Blake added: \"Whoever is gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop, and they need to be getting things to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.\" Asked whether Lord Mandelson should be required to leave the House of Lords, Blake said it was something \"we should be considering\". Downing Street later said the prime minister \"strongly\" rejected criticism of the leadership in No 10 from some of his MPs. Starmer maintained full confidence in his \"top team\" and was \"focused on delivering for the country,\" they said. Downing Street also rejected claims the prime minister is failing to engage with MPs, saying he meets with backbenchers \"regularly\" and pointing to a meeting held on Monday night, which they say was \"positive\". Badenoch also said the prime minister had \"very serious questions to answer\". \"The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when,\" she added. Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US shortly before 11:00 on Thursday. Downing Street said the emails contained \"new information\" that was not known at the time of Lord Mandelson's appointment. United States District Court Southern District of New York A picture understood to have been taken on the Caribbean island of St Barts in 2006 The full emails were published by Bloomberg and the Sun on Wednesday evening. \"I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,\" Mandelson wrote the day before Epstein reported to prison in 2008 for soliciting sex from a minor. Mandelson added: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release... Your friends stay with you and love you.\" In an interview with the Sun on Wednesday, Lord Mandelson said he felt a \"tremendous sense of regret\" that he had met Epstein, and that he \"took at face value the lies that he fed me and many others\". The BBC earlier reported that Lord Mandelson's emails were sent from an old account to which he no longer had access. Officials cite this as the reason they had not been seen earlier. In a statement announcing Lord Mandelson's dismissal, the Foreign Office said: \"The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.\" Following his sacking, Mandelson said being the UK's ambassador to the US had been \"the privilege of my life\". It comes as Sir Keir faces growing pressure over his handling of Lord Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US. Labour MP Clive Lewis, an outspoken voice on the Labour left, said Sir Keir \"doesn't seem up to the job\" , adding that there was a \"very, very dangerous atmosphere\" among Labour MPs. Another Labour MP Jo White said the \"clock is ticking\" for Sir Keir to turn polls around before local elections next May. Labour MP Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs committee, has written to the new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper asking for details on the vetting process for Lord Mandelson's appointment, and whether security concerns were dismissed. Thornberry's letter was first reported by Sky News. It also emerged that Jeffrey Epstein paid for Lord Mandelson's travel on two separate occasions in 2003 totalling more than $7,400 (£5,400), according to documents released by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee. Earlier this week, US lawmakers released an alleged \"birthday book\" containing messages sent to Jeffrey Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003 - including one from Lord Mandelson . In his letter, which features photos of the pair, Lord Mandelson described Jeffrey Epstein as his \"best pal\", and an \"intelligent, sharp-witted man\".

A further £142 million in UK aid will support Ukraine's energy infrastructure and vulnerable communities, while 100 new sanctions will aim to further hit Russia's economy and military supplies. Cooper was met by Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha at a railway station in Kyiv on Friday morning, and later met President Volodymyr Zelensky. Her visit, which the Foreign Office says reaffirms the UK's support for Ukraine, comes days after Russian drones violating Polish airspace were shot down by Poland and Nato. The Foreign Office said there had been \"a summer of Russian delay tactics at peace talks\" aimed at ending the conflict in the region, as well as increased attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Cooper added support for Kyiv was \"unwavering and stronger than ever\" and that fresh funding would support Ukraine through the winter and into 2026. She continued: \"Putin's bombardment of Ukrainian civilians, his stalling and delaying in internationally-backed peace talks, and his blatant disregard for human life must end.\" Of the funding boost, £100 million will be used to help civilians in frontline communities, including to repair critical water and heating systems, support livelihoods and strengthen resilience over the winter. The remaining £42 million will go towards carrying out vital repairs to Ukraine's electricity network and putting in place critical protection for gas and power infrastructure. Cooper will visit Kyiv's cabinet of ministers government building, which was hit for the first time on Sunday when Russia carried out its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the war began. She will also visit a residential building destroyed by a Russian strike. Separately, Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday after an invitation by an organisation that supports Ukrainians with life-changing injuries caused by the war. The Duke of Sussex, who arrived by train on Friday morning, said he wanted to do \"everything possible\" to help the recovery of injured military personnel. Reuters Prince Harry poses for a picture with wounded Ukrainian serviceman Vasyl, 38 As well as hitting economic and military targets, the Foreign Office said fresh sanctions on Russia will also hit 70 more ships involved in Putin's \"shadow fleet\" operation, responsible for illicitly carrying cargo including oil exports since the war began. Among the companies sanctioned are firms which supply Russia with equipment such as electronics, chemicals and explosives used to manufacture missiles and other weapons. Cooper said the measures \"form the next stage in the UK's leading efforts to ramp up economic pressure, alongside our security support and our work alongside the coalition of the willing for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine\". Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Theresa May is among the peers who are vehemently opposed to the legislation, arguing that it there were not enough safeguards to prevent people being pressured into ending their lives. The former Conservative PM spoke as the House of Lords began its scrutiny of the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which was passed by MPs with a majority of 23 in June. Responding outside the chamber, Leadbeater said terminally ill people supporting the Bill were \"definitely not suicidal\" but \"they are dying, and they have no choice about that\". Outside Parliament, demonstrators for and against the plans made their views known as the Bill progresses towards potentially coming into force in England and Wales. Inside, the red benches in the Lords were packed with a record number of requests to speak as two days of consideration began, with Leadbeater, who introduced the Bill to the Commons, watching from the gallery. Baroness May spoke in opposition, warning of the risk of medical cover-ups, and saying she had a friend who calls it the \"license to kill Bill\" as a result. She said in her view the legislation would be \"an assisted suicide Bill\", adding: \"Suicide is wrong, but this Bill, effectively, says suicide is okay. What message does that give to our society?\" The Bill did not have good enough safeguards to prevent people from being pressurised to end their lives, she said, and she also worried about knock-on effects around normalising deaths by suicide for people who feel their life is \"less worth living than others\". \"I worry about the impact it will have on people with disabilities, with chronic illness, with mental health problems, because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others,\" she said. Leadbeater praised Baroness May's \"very powerful contribution\" to the debate but said she found \"the framing around suicide very uncomfortable\". \"The terminally ill people I've met are definitely not suicidal,\" she told PA Media. \"They definitely don't want to die, but they are dying, and they have no choice about that.\" The MP for Spen Valley dismissed talk of potential medical cover-ups, saying the legislation aimed to put a \"very robust\" law in place to create \"a framework around the assisted death rather than the lack of framework that there is at the moment\". With peers speaking against the Bill outnumbering those in favour by about two-to-one on the first day of two days of debate, Leadbeater said she was still confident the Bill would ultimately be allowed by the Lords. \"I do remain confident that the will of the public will be respected, as will the will of the elected chamber,\" she said, referring to the House of Commons. During the debate, peers made emotional pleas on both sides of the assisted dying debate, many sharing personal tales of loss underpinning their stance. The former justice secretary Lord Charlie Falconer, who is the sponsor of the Bill in the Lords, branded the current legal situation \"confused\", causing \"terrible suffering\" and lacking \"compassion and safeguards\". Lord Falconer reassured peers there would be \"more than enough time\" for scrutiny before the current Parliamentary session ended next spring and that he was \"very open\" to suggestions for how the Bill could be \"further strengthened and improved\". However, he reminded his colleagues the Bill had already been passed by MPs and the House of Lords should \"respect the primacy of the Commons\", instead of trying to block the plans. \"We must do our job in this House, and our job is not to frustrate, it is to scrutinise,\" he said. As debate began, Conservative peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean told colleagues he had changed his mind on the issue after his father, who \"died in agony\" from cancer, said his son was to blame for not allowing him to end his suffering. \"I was completely poleaxed by that,\" he said, adding his father told him: \"you have consistently voted to prevent me getting what I want, which is having the opportunity to decide how and when I come to die\". \"As a Christian I have thought about that long and hard, and come to the conclusion that my father was right,\" he added. House of Cards trilogy author Lord Michael Dobbs described the current legal framework as \"cruel and untenable\" and insisted those who were opposed for religious reasons had \"no right to impose your view on others\". He said: \"I wish I'd had the opportunity out of love to help my mother pass peacefully in my arms, instead of watching her years of suffering. \"It would have been her choice, but she had no choice, and instead I'm left with an enduring memory of endless pain.\" Speaking in support, Baroness Margaret Hodge said \"denying choice represents a fundamental attack on the freedom and right of individuals to control their life at that terrible time when they're dying\". She said: \"In my view, we're presented with a straightforward choice: are we prepared to allow people in this country faced with certain and imminent death to choose how they die? \"I want that choice for myself, I would have wanted that choice for those close to me whom I have seen die in terrible agony.\" Speaking against, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said certain aspects of the assisted dying Bill \"blur the line\" for doctors around euthanasia. Lady Grey-Thompson, a Paralympian and long-time campaigner on the rights of disabled people, said: \"Clause 25, sub-clause eight, allows the co-ordinating doctor to assist the person to ingest or otherwise self-administer the substance. This blurs the line between assisted dying and euthanasia.\" Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally has warned that the \"choice\" to die \"is an illusion\" without \"fully-funded palliative and social care services\". Dame Sarah told the Lords: \"Above all, this Bill fails in its central plank, that it delivers choice. \"A meaningful choice would see the measures in this Bill set alongside equally available, fully-funded palliative and social care services. \"Without the choice offered, this choice is an illusion.\" The House of Lords will continue its scrutiny of the Bill on Friday, 19 September.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy saw zero growth in the month, which was in line with expectations, following a 0.4% expansion in June. However, monthly figures are volatile, and the ONS has said it will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period. In the three months to July, the economy expanded by 0.2% The government is under mounting pressure to deliver on its key priority of boosting economic growth ahead of the Budget on 26 November. In the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans with increasing speculation she will raise taxes to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. The ONS said the service sector grew by 0.4% over the three months to July, helped by a good performance from the health sector, computer programming and office support services. However, this was offset by a fall in output from the production sector, which includes manufacturing. In July itself, manufacturing contracted by 1.3% - the sharpest monthly decline since July last year. The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, and then grew by 0.3% between April and June. The ONS said the latest figures showed the economy had \"continued to slow\" over the past three months. However, it is still on track to grow in the third quarter. What is GDP? When is the Budget and what might be in it? Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the UK's finances were \"looking pretty resilient to the barrage of shocks faced this year\". The latest data also comes ahead of the Bank of England's next interest rate decision on 18 September, with policymakers weighing up flagging growth against stubborn inflation. 'Sign of things to come' Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in the Budget if she wants to meet her self-imposed rules on the economy. These are: day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30 to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30 Estimates for the size of the \"black hole\" in the public finances that Reeves needs to fill in order to meet her rules vary widely, between £18bn and £50bn, but the chancellor has rejected the latter forecast . Since Labour pledged in its manifesto last year not to raise taxes on \"working people\" - namely income tax, National Insurance and VAT - speculation is growing around what changes she might make. Companies have long spoken of the financial hit they have taken from a rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage that came into force in April. And some have warned that tax rises for business could hamper growth further, with some saying they are holding off on hiring or investing until the details of the Budget become clear. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the \"weak start to the third quarter [is] a sign of things to come\". \"Economic activity is expected to slow in the second half of the year as the temporary factors which pushed up growth in the first half of 2025 begin to fade,\" she said. \"Additionally, the later date of the Autumn Budget could prolong some uncertainties for businesses, delaying investment decisions and acting as a drag on growth until more clarity emerges.\" Responding to the latest growth figures, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We know there's more to do to boost growth because whilst our economy isn't broken, it does feel stuck. \"That's the result of years of underinvestment, which we're determined to reverse through our plan for change. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Any economic growth is welcome - but this government is distracted from the problems the country is facing. \"While the government lurch from one scandal to another, borrowing costs recently hit a 27-year high - a damning vote of no confidence in Labour that makes painful tax rises all but certain.\" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The government talks of going full throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. \"Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our High Streets and ministers' refusal to jettison their short-sighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.\" Personal finance GDP UK economy Related When is the Budget and what might be in it?

Left-wing backbencher Bell Riberio-Addy said she had not secured the 80 MP nominations needed by 17:00 BST on Thursday to progress. Phillipson, meanwhile, has secured 175 votes, while Powell has 117. In the next stage, the contenders have to win the backing of 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, such as a trade union, to go through to a ballot of members. 'Being deputy Labour leader is a ghastly job' Rayner's replacement will show which way political wind is blowing in Labour \"I want to unite our party and our movement, deliver the change our country needs and beat Reform,\" Phillipson said in a video posted on social media following Thursday evening's deadline. \"Now is the time to come together so we can unite to win again.\" Powell, meanwhile, has vowed to act as a \"bridge for all parts\" of the party. \"At a time when there are forces trying to spread division and hatred, Labour must be the voice of unity and hope,\" she said in a statement. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner, after she failed to pay enough tax on her £800,000 flat in Hove . The winner of the contest will not become deputy prime minister, as Rayner was, because that position has been handed to Justice Secretary David Lammy. Posting on social media after nominations closed on Thursday, Ribeiro-Addy said: \"Unfortunately, I have not secured the high number of nominations required to proceed in the deputy leadership contest. \"I am disappointed that the full range of Labour members' views will not be represented on the ballot paper.\" The position of deputy leader is a potentially powerful one, as a link between the Labour membership and the party leadership - and whoever wins will be at the forefront of Labour election campaigns. Crucially, they cannot be sacked by the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, as they will have their own mandate. Voting for the next deputy leader is likely to open for Labour members on 8 October and close on 23 October, with the winner being announced two days later. The remaining candidates will have an opportunity to woo Labour members at hustings during the party's conference in Liverpool at the end of September. The contest opens up chances for unhappy MPs and party members to express their discontent with the leadership, potentially overshadowing the big ministerial speeches. Phillipson - the only cabinet member left in the race - emerged as the early frontrunner after attracting support from MPs who are loyal to the government. But party members may prefer a candidate who is prepared to challenge Sir Keir, potentially harming Phillipson's chances. Powell - who was recently sacked from her cabinet role in a ministerial reshuffle - may attract the support of Labour MPs dissatisfied with the performance of Sir Keir's government and its policies. Many senior Labour figures have said the next leader should be a woman and from outside London to counter what they see as the London-centric and male-dominated party leadership.

Micheál Martin described the meeting, which took place on Friday at Chequers, as \"warm and constructive\". The Irish government, along with all of Northern Ireland's political parties and victims' groups, oppose the existing UK Legacy Act. In December, the Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn formally started the process to repeal the act. \"Very good progress has been made on legacy and the prime minister and I agreed that we are close to setting out a framework to address legacy issues, recognising its importance to victims and survivors, and to the wider community in Northern Ireland and across these islands,\" Martin told reporters following the meeting. When asked if the updated framework would be completed in a matter of weeks, he said: \"I am not going to put a time down on it but it'll be shortly.\" The Legacy Act was passed by the previous Conservative government in September 2023 despite widespread opposition to it. It created a new legacy body, the the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR), to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The act shut down all historical inquests. The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families. 'Need for a ceasefire' The situation in Gaza and the war between Russia and Ukraine were also mentioned at the meeting. \"We discussed the catastrophic situation in Gaza - the need for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and a massive surge in humanitarian aid,\" Martin said. \"We also committed to continue working together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.\" Their meeting comes after the tánaiste (Irish deputy minister) previously told a crowd in Oxford that the new agreement on dealing with legacy cases was \"effectively there\".

The former environment secretary inherited the housing brief from Angela Rayner in last week's reshuffle, after she resigned over her tax affairs . Reed told the BBC the only way out of what he called a housing \"crisis\" was to \"build baby build\" and threatened sanctions on developers who dragged their feet, although he did not specify what that might entail. Industry leaders have warned the government faces a \"huge challenge\" to reach its target, with housebuilders facing \"mounting pressures\". The Conservatives said the government's housing pledges \"are for the birds\". \"Everyone knows Labour can't deliver on their housing promises,\" shadow housing secretary James Cleverly said. \"New housing relies on backing builders. But from day one this government has been anti-business and anti-growth.\" The promise to build 1.5 million new homes over the next Parliament - which is due to run until 2029 - was a key pledge in Labour's general election manifesto. BBC Verify's Housing Tracker recently showed the number of new homes in England fell during Labour's first year in power, continuing a fall that began under the Conservatives. However, applications to build more homes have risen over the past six months. Legislation aimed at reforming the planning system to speed up housebuilding is currently going through Parliament. UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes? Labour's plan to build 1.5m homes – can it be delivered? Pressed over whether the 1.5 million pledge was a hope or a guarantee, Reed told the BBC: \"It's what we're going to do. \"We'll do it by working in partnership with the developers and with the builders,\" he said. \"My job is to get every barrier out of the way that is stopping that construction going ahead.\" Speaking during a visit to a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, Reed said he was going to come up with an \"acceleration package\" that would get planning applications approved more quickly and \"spades in the ground\". He added: \"I don't want the developers dragging their feet. They don't want to drag their feet - it's their business. \"They make money from going ahead with construction. I'm going to work in partnership with the developers but there will be sanctions if the building doesn't go ahead at pace and at scale.\" This week the Home Builders Federation warned the sector was facing rising regulatory costs and taxes , \"compounded by delays in processing planning applications\". In Bedfordshire, Garry Dixon, who runs a construction company that works on smaller residential developments, said rising costs were a \"massive\" challenge. \"I would say three years ago you were getting bricks at 75p, 80p a brick and now they're like £1.20 a brick,\" he said. \"It's just huge, and that's just one sector of the build.\" He said the government should put more money into training and apprenticeships to ensure the sector had the skills it needed, but that was not a \"quick fix\". Steve Reed was speaking to the BBC at a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire Reed was also challenged over whether the government's pledge to stop housing asylum seekers in hotels by the end of the Parliament could increase pressure on housing. The promise has prompted concern that asylum seekers could be moved into houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) - rental homes for groups of people sharing facilities. Reed told the BBC: \"We're looking at a number of options. We intend to do this in a way that does not put further pressure on the housing market. \"People are already struggling to find a place to live, to rent or to buy. We don't want to add to that burden so we will find a solution to that.\" The government has already said it is looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers , as well as considering using prefabricated buildings or warehouses. Reed was moved from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government after Rayner resigned over failing to pay enough tax on a flat purchase. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Reed said he was \"very close\" to Rayner and her resignation was \"very painful\". \"Angela's a friend who was going through a very, very difficult time. And you know on the one level, I wanted to reach out to her and support her as a friend and I did that,\" he said. \"But on another level, there are these events that I'm watching on the TV news at the same time. And it's quite odd when you suddenly find yourself and the things that are happening to the people around you in the news too.\" You can listen to Steve Reed's full interview on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson on BBC Sounds .

The move by Manchester Metropolitan University comes after Mandelson was sacked as UK ambassador to the USA by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday. He was dismissed after it was revealed that he sent Epstein supportive messages while the disgraced American financier was facing sex offences charges. A spokesman for the university - of which Mandelson was chancellor between 2016 and 2024 - said his honorary awards have been rescinded \"following the revelations that have come to light in recent days\". He had been given honorary doctorate on his appointment as chancellor, and a commemorative medal at the end of his tenure. Mandelson's links to Epstein had been discussed by the university's board of governors during his tenure, when a photograph of the two was made public. \"At that time we were reassured that there was no ongoing connection nor anything that would compromise Lord Mandelson's position,\" the university spokesman said. He added: \"Our thoughts are with the victims who were subjected to the appalling crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and to all those who continue to be affected today. \"The University no longer has any ties with Lord Mandelson.\" Mandelson, one of the principal architects of New Labour, was appointed as ambassador to the USA in December 2024. Epstein died of suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in New York City on 10 August 2019, while awaiting trial.

The annual competition, organised by The Kennel Club and Dogs Trust, took place on Thursday in Victoria Tower Gardens, in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament. Poykee, a 13-year-old Keeshond, took the crown as the competition's 2025 winner. He is owned by Sarah Edwards, the Labour MP for Tamworth. Ms Edwards said: \"It's really amazing. I was hoping that we had a chance – certainly I've been gearing Poykee up and making sure that he dazzles the judges and his personality shines through.\" Kieran Cleeves/PA Media Poykee impressed the judges of this year's competition The Tamworth MP said the pair had been doing preparation work ahead of the competition, \"making sure that he really promotes what it is to be a fabulous pet but also a creature with a really individual personality as well\".

In a now deleted social media post, Jim O'Neill, who leads the Reform group on Blackpool Council, said the party \"may be morphing into something I didn't sign up for\". O'Neill, who joined Reform after former leader Richard Tice took over in 2021, said the party was \"starting to feel like the Tories 2.0... but only excepting their rejects\". A number of high profile former Conservative MPs including Nadine Dorries, Dame Andrea Jenkins and former Rossendale and Darwen MP Sir Jake Berry have defected to Reform in recent months. 'Born from frustration' O'Neill, who represents the Marton ward, said he was not against other Tories joining. He added: \"I'm not against anybody with any political background joining Reform UK. There are some fantastic Conservative MPs and former Conservative MPs who could be, let's say, ideologically aligned with Reform.\" O'Neill said the social media post was \"born of frustration\", and had decided to take it down because the party conference was underway and he did not want it to look as though he was \"attention seeking\". But he said he stood by what he said. \"If you're not prepared to question what's going on then you're probably not the right person to be fulfilling any kind of political office, because you do need to question these things.\" O'Neill refused to say whether he was planning to leave the party, adding: \"I want to see what other announcements come out.\" Reform UK has been approached for comment.

A blaze broke out at the Washington and Gateshead South MP's constituency office in Vermont House, Concord, Washington, just after midnight, Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service (TWFRS) said. The man in his 20s was also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and remained in police custody, Northumbria Police said. The spokesperson for Hodgson said she \"will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents\". Images also show graffiti on the side of the building which reads \"328 days blood on ur [sic] hands,\" but it is believed to have been there for around a year. A Labour source confirmed there had been a number of incidents of vandalism at Hodgson's office recently, including smashed windows. \"We will not be commenting or speculating while there is an ongoing police investigation, what we are clear on is there is no place for this kind of violence in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"Sharon will not be deterred and will continue to support her constituents in Washington and Gateshead South as she does day in, day out.\" Getty Images A spokesperson said Sharon Hodgson would not be deterred Northumbria Police urged anyone with information to contact the force. TWFRS sent seven appliances to the fire and no causalities were reported. Labour councillor Phil Tye, chair of TWFRS, said: \"Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this incident. \"I'd like to thank our firefighters and control staff for their dedication and teamwork during what may be a challenging investigation.\" As well as the MP's office, charities and businesses operate out of Vermont House. The charity Niemann-Pick UK (NP UK), which supports patients and families with rare and life-limiting genetic diseases, said it had been told there is \"not much left\". NP UK's head of communications John Taggart said: \"We've been in operation for 34 years and it is going to be really hard to recover. \"This is a vital service and we are a small charity.\" OpCourage North The Veterans Mental Health and Wellbeing Service also works out of the building, as well as a wedding dress shop. OpCourage said its face-to-face appointments had been moved to remote consultations or alternative locations, and it would be using a hospital site as a temporary base from Monday. On social media, Rare Bridal Studio said its studio was unaffected by the fire but it was unable to access the unit due to the active crime scene, meaning it had to postpone appointments with customers. The fire service said it sent seven appliances to battle the blaze Hodgson has served as MP for the area since 2005, when she was elected to the former Gateshead East and Washington West constituency. She won the new Washington and Sunderland West seat in 2010 following boundary changes, keeping the seat until 2024 when she was elected to the new Washington and Gateshead South constituency. During a question at the House of Commons earlier, Labour MP for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East Andy McDonald said: \"I'm sure I speak for the whole House in sending our best wishes to our colleague in Washington and Gateshead South for the appalling fire at her office overnight, and send our very best wishes to her and her staff.\" Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said: \"I think particularly in light of international events, and the tragic loss of colleagues, this all the more underlines why we must have security and safety to go about democratic debate in this country, whatever our views, in a safe and secure way.\" Additional reporting by PA Media.

What a mess.\" A senior Labour MP is not the only one in disbelief at the latest - you couldn't make it up - mishap for this government. How Downing Street handled revelations about Lord Mandelson's friendship with the wealthy paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was the first test of the new senior team in No 10. The uncharitable view is they flunked it by not acting quickly enough – putting the prime minister's face on the calamity by sending him into the bearpit of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) with a staunch defence of his man in Washington. They knew there were new allegations about his relationship with Epstein. The direction of travel seemed set - and Mandelson would likely have to go. The even more uncomfortable factor is that last week the prime minister defended another colleague, Angela Rayner, when - you guessed it - the direction of travel in Westminster seemed set, and she would likely have to go. It's undermined the prime minister's own authority and blown the chance of a quick autumn reset for Labour, when the party was desperately trying to turn the page. The more generous argument made by Sir Keir's allies - he's been let down by two different people in two different ways, and has had to front up to clean up their different messes. \"Keir is frustrated and a bit angry because he is having to deal with the conduct of others, rather than show what he is trying to do,\" one source says. Another says: \"He hired someone who didn't tell him the full truth.\" No 10 doesn't imagine that the damage of the last fortnight of farce is limited to those who have departed government. And as they absorb the scale of the embarrassment over Mandelson's friendship with Epstein, new details over who knew what - and when - are emerging all the time. Westminster sources have suggested the prime minister himself had raised questions about Mandelson's links with Epstein during an initial vetting process carried out by the Cabinet Office before he was given the job. But then he was checked out again by the Foreign Office once he'd been appointed. Carl Court/Pool via REUTERS So where did it all begin? Even before Labour won the election in 2024 there had been a desire in Sir Keir's circle to look beyond the traditional diplomatic appointment for their ambassador to the White House, one of the government's plum jobs. They had noted how the former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was sent to DC and determined that a politician could be the right choice. With his experience as a trade commissioner, an impressive spider's web of contacts, and respected political nous, Mandelson was soon determined to be an excellent potential fit. Sir Keir's powerful chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, believed there were only two qualified candidates for the role, and was enthusiastic about Mandelson. Before the final decision was made last autumn, the Cabinet Office was asked, as it would be for any such candidate, to consider whether he was fit to be offered the job. Already at that stage it was no secret Mandelson had been friends with Epstein, so it was obvious those links would need to be considered. I'm told a file on Mandelson from the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET), whose job it is to know where the bodies are buried in Whitehall, was presented to the prime minister that included information about his relationship with the disgraced millionaire. On reading this file, Sir Keir had three questions he wanted to clarify with the peer, a No 10 source tells me: Why had he continued his friendship with Epstein after he was first convicted and not broken contact with him? Why had he stayed at one of Epstein's houses when the financier was in jail? And was he a \"founding citizen\" of an ocean conservation charity that Epstein had backed? Carl Court/Pool via Reuters That trio of questions was put to Mandelson in an email from Sir Keir's chief of staff McSweeney on his behalf. The peer, I'm told, replied to those questions in an email in which Downing Street sources now say he was \"economical with the truth\". It's understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009 while Epstein was in prison. Another source confirmed that he told Downing Street he had not stayed there. Court documents revealed in 2023 Epstein told his private banker that Mandelson would be staying at the property. Mandelson has never explicitly denied or confirmed he did, although it has been reported that he had no recollection of doing so. It's worth noting that none of those issues - the possible house stay, the charity, or the continued friendship - were discovered during the vetting process. They had been reported in previous years. But the guarantees relayed to the prime minister by Mandelson were considered sufficient to be worth the gamble of giving him the job. No 10 questioned Mandelson on Epstein links before appointment Once the appointment was then made, sources suggest the \"developed vetting\" process then kicked in, under the auspices of the Foreign Office. The normal process for government appointments is dependent on the job being given and the sensitivity of the material and information to be handled. But there is scarcely a job with a higher level of trust required than the White House ambassador, given the two countries' links on security, defence, trade and intelligence. I'm told nothing was flagged to No 10 as a result of the DV process, which would have involved an in-person interview which in this case, \"ought to have been completely forensic, but they must have used the wrong lens,\" according to another senior figure. Unlike the PET file, Downing Street would not receive the results of such a process as a matter of course, even in an extremely high-profile appointment. The DV process is a standalone routine. And Downing Street sources insist that they weren't made aware of any problems, so everything went ahead. The upshot? Even though there were two different processes checking out Mandelson's background, which publicly was known to include dealings with a notorious wealthy sex offender, neither appear to have turned up anything major - nor the now notorious emails which investigative reporters were able to locate recently. One Whitehall insider told me it was \"staggering - either they skipped the process of any basic due diligence, or they did that process and missed the obvious questions\". \"No one involved in making the appointment cared enough to check whether all the risk had been identified in appointing a man who had twice previously had to resign over his judgement. Careless doesn't cover it.\" The government has repeatedly said this week that part of the problem was the messages between Mandelson and Epstein were from a defunct email address. Yet a senior Whitehall figure tells me it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done. Neither Downing Street nor the Cabinet Office wanted to comment. Until this week, it seemed No 10's calculated risk of appointing Mandelson was paying off. Not just because US President Donald Trump appeared to enjoy his company, praising his \"beautiful accent\" on camera recently in the Oval Office, but also because the UK had got its trade deal . The state visit was all about to unfold in its pomp and glory. Sir Keir appeared, unlike many other global leaders, to have managed to build a warm and functional relationship with the most powerful man in the western world. All of that, at least partly down to the smooth talking and politicking of the ambassador. Victoria Jones/PA Wire Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the UK on Tuesday - his first was in 2019 (pictured) What he and No 10 were enjoying as a successful tenure was to be suddenly disrupted when the peer featured in what's known as the Epstein \"birthday book\". It features a cosy message - Mandelson branding Epstein his \"best pal\", and a photograph of the two in which Mandelson is wearing a bathrobe. And what was to prove more serious, reporters at the news agency Bloomberg managed to get hold of a cache of Epstein's emails, which included his communications with Mandelson over months and years. In an attempt to get ahead of the story, Mandelson predicted that a whole slew of contact between the two was about to emerge into public view - and he described the revelations to The Sun as \"very embarrassing\". This sent alarm bells clanging back in Whitehall. He hadn't shared the contents of the emails with Downing Street and had been \"dismissive, claiming there was nothing new\" in the stories emerging about his friendship with Epstein earlier in the week, sources suggest. But, by late on Tuesday, the government was aware that more damaging allegations were coming, and contacted the peer to ask what was going on. On Wednesday morning, Mandelson's prediction of there being more to come was first reported, just as, in the normal routine, No 10 was planning the day and preparing the prime minister for his weekly PMQs bout in the Commons. At noon, before government had heard back from Lord Mandelson, the prime minister gave a staunch public defence of him in a move that now looks foolhardy. But when Mandelson did reply after PMQ's, the government didn't think his answers were good enough. The prime minister's chief of staff McSweeney was called out of a meeting in a secure room in Whitehall where mobile communications are forbidden. Sources suggest the decision was made soon after to ask Mandelson to resign. He refused, trying to \"brazen it out\" - sources suggest he kept \"telling everyone it would be fine\". On Wednesday No 10 was also trying to weigh up the impact of losing the ambassador on the crucial state visit of the US president , just days away, and also what the legal ramifications would be of forcing Mandelson out. But later on Wednesday night, the full extent of those emails were published by Bloomberg, and the prime minister read the exchanges in all their gory glory. \"Keir was furious,\" I'm told, and on Thursday morning, he made the formal decision with the foreign secretary that if Labour's veteran fixer wouldn't go on his own accord, he'd be sacked . So what happens now? REUTERS/Leah Millis Trump and Mandelson shook hands after a UK-US trade deal was signed earlier this summer On Friday the prime minister was working at his country retreat, Chequers, mulling over his conference speech for which Sir Keir has \"picked up the pen\", in a more proactive way than in times gone by, aware this is a moment when the pressure to lift the mood and show his worth is intense. After a first year in office that disappointed many in the Labour Party, and left them in the polling doldrums, his big moment on the podium at conference was already set to be a high-wire act. After this chaotic fortnight, it's \"fortuitous we are heading to conference and we can grab the mic,\" one insider said. Another senior figure told me: \"I don't see problems that aren't fixable.\" But when it comes to Lord Mandelson, the clamour may take some time to fade . \"This isn't over – No 10 is in total denial,\" a party insider said. A different prominent source told me the Mandelson mess \"is just another big misstep\". Alongside Sir Keir, there is also growing disquiet about the prime minister's chief of staff McSweeney. It's no secret he was keen to appoint Mandelson, even though he and the prime minister did have questions about his relationship with Epstein. But sources dispute he was trying save the US ambassador from his fate this week. It's said he agreed on Wednesday lunchtime Mandelson had to go, before travelling to Brussels for meetings, leaving him out of the country when the final call to sack him was made. When politicians are down, powerful staffers often become a target. Opposition politicians and critics on the inside can even appear to enjoy the hunt for someone to blame. However, McSweeney is central to Sir Keir's leadership. \"If there's no Morgan, there's no Starmer,\" one senior Labour figure said, warning MPs warming up to point the finger to be careful about where it all might lead. After a dreadful start of what should have been a shiny new political season, one cabinet minister says in sorrow: \"We have made the right big strategic calls, but there is just no way that we should be in this position after a year.\" But others believe all is not lost. Just as Labour slumped in popularity at breakneck speed after winning the election, senior figures suggest their fortunes could improve dramatically quickly too. Volatility in politics can be governments' enemy, but also potentially be their friend. Yet right now, it's hard to see where Labour can find much comfort. There is little option but to keep going, to focus on what insiders characterise as \"good announcements\" coming in the next few weeks, presenting a huge opportunity for the prime minister to shift the dial and boost the party's confidence. But one minister joked after a shocking fortnight for the government: \"I keep thinking maybe it's all a very detailed dream and I'll wake up.\" \"But then no, this is reality, and we just have to get on with it.\" They certainly do.

In autumn last year, when Downing Street were mulling over who to send to Washington, the Labour peer's friendship with the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - and the fact that it carried on after the billionaire was convicted - was part of the PM's calculation. \"The Epstein stuff in broad terms was definitely known and discussed in detail before his appointment,\" said one source. Another insider said that as part of the Cabinet Office vetting process Lord Mandelson was \"specifically asked about the association with Epstein\" and he was \"clear about it\". No 10 argued today that the \"depth and extent\" of that relationship was \"materially different\" from what was known last year. But back then, pictures of Epstein and Lord Mandelson trying on belts in a clothes shop, and blowing out candles on a birthday cake were in the public domain. News reports before Lord Mandelson's appointment showed contact between the pair even after Epstein's conviction for the sexual abuse of underage girls. At the time, we raised these facts in conversations with government officials. The responses demonstrated the conflicted attitude many in Labour clearly felt towards a party grandee they saw as both a masterful political operator and a deeply flawed man. One party insider sighed and spoke of Lord Mandelson's fascination with power and money. A longtime friend of the peer told me: \"Peter has weaknesses. He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\" Starmer is losing senior figures at the rate of one a week Mandelson sacked as US ambassador by Starmer over emails to Epstein Peter Mandelson: Rise and fall of Labour's political fixer Mandelson sacked as ambassador to US over Epstein links And yet the calculation Sir Keir made, alongside his top foreign affairs adviser Jonathan Powell and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, was that Lord Mandelson's talents outweighed the risks. Allies of the outgoing ambassador still suggest it was probably the right decision considering what the PM knew last autumn. \"If you look at his success in the role, the reasons for appointing him were vindicated,\" said a friend of the peer. \"He's been good on trade and built a strong relationship with the White House. He's been exemplary.\" Former President George W Bush nicknamed Lord Mandelson \"Silvertongue\". The peer knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, has met Elon Musk, and holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Part of the irony of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein is that he shares that very same link with President Trump - proof of a top level if murky network among US elites. After four decades in politics, Lord Mandelson's career in public life now seems sure to be over. But questions about the prime minister's judgement remain. Last autumn, Sir Keir decided that being friends with a convicted paedophile in the past should not exclude someone from high public office. This week the volume, scale and excruciating details of the pair's contacts, plus the revelation that the peer encouraged the paedophile to challenge his conviction changed the PM's view. Many Labour MPs think their leader should have seen this scandal a mile off.

Rayner resigned from the role - as well as her government jobs of housing secretary and deputy prime minister - after failing to pay enough tax when buying a flat. Candidates had until Thursday evening to win the backing of at least 80 Labour MPs, and then need support from either 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, including two unions. The winner will then be decided in a vote of party members, with an announcement due on 25 October. Phillipson and Powell set for Labour deputy showdown Rayner replacement must be a woman, says Harman Burnham concerned about balance of cabinet after Rayner exit Bridget Phillipson PA Media Phillipson is the only cabinet minister on the list, pledging to unite the party and take on Reform UK. As education secretary, she would be more supportive of the government than other candidates. The Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South since 2010, Phillipson has highlighted her background and her journey from growing up in a council house, to taking on the highest ministerial ranks of government. Describing herself as a \"proud working-class woman from the north east\", Phillipson said that with her help Labour could defeat Nigel Farage's party while \"staying true\" to its values of equality, fairness and social justice. \"With me as deputy leader we will beat them right across the country and unite to deliver the opportunity that working people across this great country deserve,\" Phillipson said. Other cabinet ministers had been reluctant to stand, fearing the possibility of defeat by a backbencher or somebody more junior. She is almost certain to attract the support of the 80 MPs required by Thursday. Lucy Powell EPA Backed by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, Lucy Powell has been the MP for Manchester Central since 2012. Announcing she was standing as a candidate, Powell said she would aim to bring together \"all parts of the party\" and unite \"our broad voter coalition\". She added that in her time in government she had \"championed our backbenchers, made sure their voices were heard, and sought to unite our team\". Until recently she was leader of the House of Commons, responsible for organising government business in the chamber, as well as modernising Parliament and improving working conditions for MPs and staff. However, she was sacked from that role in the recent reshuffle. Who isn't running? Housing Minister Alison McGovern was a candidate but pulled out, saying it was clear she did not have the required support from MPs to run. She has given her backing to Phillipson. Foreign affairs committee chair Emily Thornberry and Liverpool Wavertree MP Paula Barker both withdrew from the race on Thursday. Clapham and Brixton Hill MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the preferred candidate of Labour's Socialist Campaign Group, had to withdraw after getting support from 24 MPs, 56 nominations short of the cut-off. Shabana Mahmood, who was promoted from justice secretary to home secretary in last week's reshuffle, has ruled herself out of the race, as has her cabinet colleague, Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Former Transport Secretary Louise Haigh and Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan, who works as an NHS doctor, have also said they are not putting themselves forward. Backbench MP Barry Gardiner, a former member of Corbyn's shadow cabinet who had been floated by some on the left of the party as a potential candidate, has said he will not stand. David Lammy will remain Sir Keir's deputy prime minister, regardless of who wins. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA Associated British Foods Primark owner’s boss warns Reeves not to give consumer sentiment ‘another great whack’ in budget George Weston, CEO at ABF, also said food price inflation had peaked and would now start to ease Sarah Butler Wed 10 Sep 2025 12.25 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 13.01 EDT Share The chief executive of the Kingsmill owner Associated British Foods (ABF) has warned Rachel Reeves not to give consumer sentiment “another whack” in her upcoming budget, despite signalling that food price rises had peaked and will now start to ease. George Weston, the chief executive of the ABF conglomerate which also owns the fashion chain Primark and produces sugar and cooking ingredients, said recent food price inflation had been driven by employers passing on increases to labour costs announced in Reeves’ first budget as chancellor last year. He said most retailers had now passed these costs on and “food inflation will be gradually easing from now” as the cost of commodities was “pretty benign”. View image in fullscreen George Weston said shoppers had reined in their spending due to high food prices. Photograph: ABF Grocery inflation stood at 5% in August, according to the latest data from analysts Worldpanel, contributing to wider inflation, which rose to 3.8% in July. He added that Primark had not raised clothing prices in a year as it had been able to offset higher labour costs with more technology, such as self-service tills and lower freight and cotton prices. Weston said given the higher food prices, Primark’s shoppers had kept a tighter rein on spending than more affluent consumers. “We had to work very hard to earn our shoppers’ money, as we are not in an easy consumer environment,” he said, with sales in the UK and Ireland rising by 1% over the six months to 13 September, helped by new store openings. But shares in ABF slid more than 13% on Wednesday as analysts said trading at Primark’s mainland Europe outlets had been worse than hoped. The company also warned that sugar profits would be below expectations. ABF’s sugar business, which includes the closing Vivergo ethanol plant , is also likely to make a £40m loss, much deeper than feared. The company said group sales are expected to have fallen by 2% at established Primark stores in the six months to 13 September, with sales flat at established UK stores and sales falls in Germany, France and Italy. Weston blamed “political turmoil” in France, which was the worst performing country, and consumer uncertainty elsewhere in Europe amid the Ukraine war and inflation. Weston said Primark was “trading very strongly” as a seasonal change in the weather had led to demand for warmer clothing and it had sharpened up its fashion ranges, particularly on denim. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many retailers fear Reeves will impose further tax increases on businesses in her 26 November budget. Weston said: “I hope consumer sentiment doesn’t take another great whack in November … anything that reduces returns on investment or increases the costs of employing people [could affect sentiment]”. Weston said he would like to see Reeves’ November budget “closing that big loophole around de minimis” – a tax break that allows Shein and others to import items worth less than £135 direct to consumers without paying customs duty. “I don’t like to be faced with competition that has an unfair advantage which could be costing the Treasury maybe £100m a year,” he said. “A lot of money is being left on the table unnecessarily.” He also called on the chancellor to revise plans to increase business rates for large high street stores.

Pensions minister Torsten Bell and Starmer’s new chief economic adviser, Minouche Shafik , will co-chair the “budget board”, that will meet weekly to discuss the details of the statement. Government sources said the meetings were aimed at ensuring No 10 and No 11 were aligned and that there was not a repeat of the backlash from businesses that followed Rachel Reeves’s maiden budget. Starmer has looked to increase his grip on economic policy in recent weeks, by appointing Shafiq, poaching Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones, and appointing a longtime Treasury civil servant to be his principal private secretary. Reeves and her team were blamed for a series of political missteps last year, including slashing the winter fuel allowance, while business lobby groups have blamed her £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) for raising the cost of hiring and forcing them to push up prices. With the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) widely expected to downgrade its forecasts, the chancellor is expected to have to find significant tax increases in November, to avoid busting her fiscal rules in five years’ time. Bell, the former director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, has previously suggested a series of radical tax policies, including on inheritance tax, pensions and national insurance. But government officials confirmed the panel would also include Reeves’s chief of staff, Katie Martin, who recently took on the job of liaising with businesses on Reeves’s behalf, and Varun Chandra, who canvasses firms for No 10. The trio are expected to bring a business perspective to the discussions, which is likely to inject a note of caution around more radical policies. Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was seen by some in government as one of the driving forces behind the botched welfare reforms at the spring statement, will also attend. The prime minister’s new chief secretary, Darren Jones – previously a Treasury minister – and the communications directors from both No 10 and No 11, will sit on the board, too, officials confirmed. Also on the board will be Starmer’s new communications chief, Tim Allan , a veteran of Tony Blair’s time in government, with the former prime minister once describing him as “even more right wing than me”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Vistry Group Housebuilder Vistry’s profits more than halve amid economic uncertainty Fall to £40.9m in first six months of year pushes share price down, with order book lower than year ago Mark Sweney and Julia Kollewe Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.27 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 07.45 EDT Share Half-year profits at Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, have more than halved as buyer demand comes under pressure from concerns over the economy, affordability struggles and slower-than-hoped interest rate cuts . The company, which owns Bovis Homes, Countryside and Linden Homes, said its pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell by 55% to £40.9m. The slump in profits, which on an adjusted basis fell by a third to £80.6m, pushed the housebuilder’s share price down as much as 8% in early trading, before recovering to 4% down on Wednesday. Vistry completed 6,889 homes, down by 12% from the 7,792 completed a year earlier. Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn. “While we reported some positive momentum in the first quarter, market conditions softened somewhat in the second quarter, reflecting increased macro concerns and ongoing affordability challenges, particularly for first-time buyers, with expected interest rate cuts being pushed further out,” the builder said. Vistry said its forward order book was lower than a year ago, standing at £4.3bn against £5.1bn this time last year. It added that it was looking to boost flagging demand with sales and marketing initiatives. It is offering private buyers discounts of up to 5% on the sale price. “We are looking to drive an improvement in our open market sales rate in the second half through our sales and marketing initiatives albeit we remain mindful that demand will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties,” it said. Prices rose by 3% for private open market sales in the first half to £389,000 on average but it said sales rates were flat. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% in August but economists are expecting further reductions to come at a far slower pace amid stubbornly high inflation. However, Vistry was upbeat, saying it remained on track to meet full-year expectations. The company formed a long-term joint venture with the UK’s housing agency , Homes England, earlier this week. The new vehicle, Hestia, is backed by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government pledged to build 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vistry has shifted towards building social and affordable homes for its partners; it pre-sells at least 50% of new homes on its developments to housing associations, local authorities and private rented sector providers. Anthony Codling, a housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: “[Private rented sector] investors continue to drive a hard bargain, leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding; so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way. “We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders.” Explore more on these topics Vistry Group Construction industry Housing market Real estate Interest rates Economics news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Seven UK housebuilders to pay £100m to fund affordable homes after CMA investigation 9 Jul 2025 UK construction activity contracts for fourth straight month as costs rise 7 May 2025 UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEO 1 Apr 2025 In the rush to build houses, let’s remember what communities need 17 Mar 2025 Housebuilder Vistry pins hopes on £2bn affordable homes promise as profits fall 26 Mar 2025 Recruitment report reveals rise in UK demand for construction workers 17 Mar 2025 UK housebuilder Vistry’s shares plunge as it issues third profit warning 24 Dec 2024 From backwater to hotspot: how HS2 could bring £10bn economic boost to Old Oak Common 2 Mar 2025 Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Confederation of British Industry (CBI) CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Rain Newton-Smith tells chancellor ‘the time for tinkering is over’ and revisit promise not to raise taxes on working people CBI chief: ‘It’s time for Reeves to reconsider Labour’s manifesto promises on tax’ Heather Stewart and Richard Partington Tue 9 Sep 2025 12.04 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.17 EDT Share The boss of the Confederation of British Industry has suggested the chancellor should tear up Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, in a significant intervention before the budget. Rachel Reeves is widely expected to present a package of tax rises in her 26 November statement to offset deteriorating economic forecasts. However, the chancellor has been hamstrung by Labour’s promise not to increase the three main revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. In a surprise move in the debate about how to raise extra revenue, the CBI’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, says the “time for tinkering is over”. Writing in the Guardian, the head of the longstanding lobby group representing many of the UK’s largest companies warns the chancellor against “slavish adherence” to tax promises made in the run-up to last year’s general election. She said the pre-election promises have now been overtaken by events. “The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,” she writes. “The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago.” The party’s manifesto states : “Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.” As well as suggesting Reeves revisit Labour’s promises on personal taxation, Newton-Smith calls for the reform of business rates, VAT thresholds for small firms and stamp duty. Reeves used her maiden budget last October to announce a £40bn package of tax increases , including a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions that was widely criticised by businesses and has been blamed for helping fuel inflation. The chancellor subsequently promised not to return with further tax rises, saying “there’s no need to come back with another budget like this” and “we’ll never need to do that again.” However, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts, after a review of its optimistic-looking expectations for productivity. This shift, coming after costly U-turns on welfare reform and the winter fuel allowance, could leave the Treasury looking for £20bn-£30bn in revenue in five years’ time to put Reeves on course to meet her fiscal rules. Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, agreed with Newton Smith that finding £20bn or more within the constraints of the manifesto would be problematic. “Raising that amount without touching taxes that account for three-quarters of the UK’s tax base risks distorting behaviour, loading excessive pain on to small groups, and harming economic growth,” she said. “Manifesto pledges are important, but there’s a point at which they cause more harm than they’re worth.” Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her determination to stick to the pledges in recent weeks, however, as speculation has mounted about potential tax rises. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are protecting payslips for working people by keeping our promise not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.” As well as calling for tax changes, Newton-Smith also reiterates the CBI’s concerns about the government’s employment rights legislation, which she argues is deterring firms from hiring. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill includes immediate protection from unfair dismissal, after a yet-to-be determined probationary period, the right to regular hours, and the right for unions to access workplaces. Union leaders gathering in Brighton for the TUC conference on Tuesday said Labour had sought to issue reassurances that the party was still committed to the landmark bill. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who is standing in the contest to succeed Rayner as deputy Labour leader, told delegates on Tuesday: “One year ago we were elected to deliver this employment rights bill, and congress that is what we will do. We will not accept any watering down by the Lords. Forward with the employment rights bill in full. No ifs, no buts.” One union leader said ministers risked blowing up relations with the labour movement at a difficult moment for the government, and would need to retain its workers’ rights plan to show a key point of difference with Nigel Farage’s Reform. “They are not going to want to go to party conference fighting with us,” the leader argued. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said the government reshuffle had created “anxiety” at the Brighton conference, but that he believed Labour would push ahead with a policy that sought to bridge business and union demands. “We need to take business with us on this journey, the re-regulation of the labour market is necessary and not up for debate, but, you know, we know what it’s like to have been on the wrong end of getting things done to us for 14 years.” Keir Starmer carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle in the wake of Rayner’s departure, partly aimed at bolstering the government’s growth agenda. At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the prime minister told colleagues they should be ready to “move from fixing the foundations to driving forward the growth and national renewal that delivers for working people”, according to a readout from his official spokesperson.

So for the reshuffle to be more than political theatre, it needs to regalvanise the growth mission. That means making it easier for business to invest, create jobs and drive higher living standards. Leadership calls not only for promises, but vision and delivery. There are no easy choices, either on policy or personnel. And as we look ahead to the chancellor’s budget in November, she must recognise that that we must avoid short-term solutions that risk us getting stuck in a cycle between fiscal events. The government must grasp the nettle and find the right solutions to the big challenges on tax and regulation. This decisive action can then be matched by business investment to get our economy back on the rise and deliver improved living standards for people in every region. The prime minister said we cannot tax our way to growth and that is certainly true. Businesses already pay more tax than ever before. The £308bn paid last year more than covers the budgets of the NHS, schools and defence combined. Businesses are also picking up a greater proportion of the tax bill: paying 30% of all tax in 2023-24, the highest proportion since 1998, rising to 32% from this year as they pay an extra £24bn in NICs. Alongside this burden, business regulation is growing. The employment rights bill in its current form will add cost and complexity, is already leading some firms to put hiring plans on ice, and risks making it even harder to bring people back into work. There is still a chance to achieve the bill’s aims without frustrating those shared goals, but government must seize it now. Sectors critical for job creation in local communities often have low margins and high fixed costs so feel cumulative tax rises and the burden of unwieldy regulation more sharply. And most of the taxes they pay – including VAT, business rates and NICs – are due whether they make a profit or not. A further tax rise for enterprise would not only be unwise but would run contrary to the promises of autumn 2024, when businesses last stomached a tax hit. Further rises would leave us with a growth plan in name only. Profit is not a dirty word – it’s the reward for taking risks, it funds investment, creates jobs, and powers pay rises. Businesses that cannot sustain themselves also cannot sustain the jobs that rely on them – let alone invest and grow. The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions. The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago. The chancellor must commit to tax reform, not just tax rises. It is the structure of the system, not just the rates, that holds back growth: business rates penalise investment; the VAT threshold discourages scaling; and stamp duty restricts labour mobility. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How do we help small businesses burst through the VAT ceiling? Can we fix tax thresholds and childcare so it always pays to work harder? How do we ensure tax doesn’t stop people moving? Could road pricing fill the yawning gap government faces as fuel duties decline? Many plausible answers have been in the “good idea but too difficult” box for too long. Now is the time to fix things we know have long been broken. (You can add not backing away from driving efficiency in public services to that list of hard but necessary reforms too.) While it’s imperative to understand the challenges we face, that does not equate to talking down our economy. There are deep roots of greatness and potential in the UK: our universities are world-beating, our life sciences sector is a global leader, and our financial services are a powerhouse industry. We have everything we need to steal a march on our competitors, but only if we act fast and decisively now. The time for tinkering is over. We need to see commitment to the vision, reform and delivery, delivery, delivery of the government’s chief economic aim, growth. That means along with changes of personnel, changing outdated tax policies that risk hobbling our national ambition. The writer is the chief executive of the CBI business lobby group.

The revisions are 50% higher than last year’s adjustment and were on the higher end of Wall Street estimates between 600,000 and 1 million. The revision comes after a lackluster August jobs report , with only 22,000 jobs added in the US. That report too contained revisions and noted that 13,000 jobs were lost for the month of June 2025, the first negative jobs report survey since December 2020. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, the highest rate since 2021. Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, after a weak July job’s report that he claimed – without evidence – was “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. But while these revisions to the jobs data are large, they are not unusual. During periods of economic change – such as the introduction of tariffs and the arrival of AI in the workplace – economists note businesses often take longer to reply to the BLS’s surveys, leading to gaps in their data. US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing slowdown amid Trump tariffs Read more “Annual revisions incorporate slow, administrative (non-survey) data that helps keep monthly estimates representative of broad labor-market trends,” stated Friends of Bureau of Labor Statistics in an FAQ on job statistics from the bureau . The largest revisions were in leisure and hospitality (down 176,000), professional and business services (down 158,000) and retail trade (down 126,200). Government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000 jobs. The numbers released will face further revisions when BLS releases final benchmark figure in February 2026. “These numbers are likely to anger President Trump and the White House who incorrectly view revised data as political manipulation,” wrote Elise Gould and Ben Zipperer, economists at the Economic Policy Institute, in a post on the report. “Trump has already lashed out at BLS, including firing the agency’s commissioner because a jobs report showed a rapidly weakening labor market. But these BLS data revisions are not corrections of mistakes. Revisions are part of the regular, transparent process to update employment counts with the most comprehensive data possible.” Explore more on these topics US unemployment and employment data US economy Economics Donald Trump news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Retail industry UK retail sales rise but stores fear tax worries could hit festive period Warm weather and interest rate cut lift sales in August, as food, drink and computers perform strongly Mark Sweney Tue 9 Sep 2025 01.00 EDT Last modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 02.38 EDT Share Record warm weather and a Bank of England interest rate cut lifted retail sales in August, according to the latest survey, but retailers fear that speculation about tax rises could weigh on consumers in the crucial pre-Christmas trading period. Retail sales increased 3.1% year on year as consumer spending on food and drink rose, and sales of computers and related equipment performed well as parents readied children for the new school year. However, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which publishes the monthly figures in conjunction with KPMG, said the 4.7% boost in spending on food and drink was due to price rises as opposed to consumers buying more products. The report said food inflation was driven by rising prices across staples including beef, chocolate and coffee. And while computing – and gaming – continued to show strong sales, parents facing an expensive start to the new school year cut back on buying uniforms. The BRC said businesses were concerned about sales in the golden quarter, the crucial three-month period in the run-up to Christmas that many retailers rely on for the bulk of their revenues. “Sunny weather and an interest rate cut helped August round off a solid summer of sales,” said the chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Despite a better summer, retailers approach the golden quarter with caution. “With the later-than-expected budget falling just days before Black Friday [discount sales], many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas.” Last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the budget would be held on 26 November , later than many had expected. Last month’s sales increase followed a rise of 2.5% in July, fuelled by warm weather and England’s successful Euros football campaign , and 3.1% in June. The latest report also found furniture sales grew for the second month in a row, after months of decline, as did home goods such as appliances, DIY products and garden tools. Linda Ellett, the head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: “Sales of many home goods have been seeing monthly increases since the spike in property transactions ahead of the changes to stamp duty in April. “Home appliances, accessories and DIY and garden tools all saw sales growth in August. New product launches also boosted mobile phone sales.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall non-food sales increased by 1.8% year on year last month, the third consecutive monthly increase. However, the report also found that shopper confidence fell for the third consecutive month in August, with many expecting further food price inflation and other financial pressures. Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said: “The emotional weight of rising energy bills and fears of tax hikes in the autumn budget are adding to the strain, especially as unemployment ticks upward “Yet there are glimmers of relief: interest rates have been cut again, and mortgage rates are easing, offering some financial respite. Financially resilient shoppers may remain more confident, even as they brace for a challenging winter.” Explore more on these topics Retail industry Economics news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Svet Jacqueline/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock Ukraine EU and US officials meet as Trump says he is ready to impose further sanctions on Russia Europe and US consider further actions to weaken Russia after largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend Jennifer Rankin in Brussels Mon 8 Sep 2025 13.21 EDT First published on Mon 8 Sep 2025 09.11 EDT Share The EU’s most senior sanctions envoy is holding talks in Washington with US officials after Donald Trump said he was ready to take further action against Russia over the war in Ukraine . David O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, is meeting US counterparts on Monday, as Europe and the US look for tougher measures to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine after Russia launched its largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend. Ahead of those meetings, the head of the European Council, António Costa, hailed transatlantic cooperation over sanctions against Russia and said it was clear that the US remained engaged in supporting Ukraine. Trump says he is ready to impose new sanctions on Russia. What might happen now? Read more A European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that its president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, over the phone on Friday, and “the only topic during the call was Ukraine”. Asked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions against Russia , Trump responded: “Yeah I am,”without elaborating. Trump also said that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and that he would speak to the Russian president soon. Trump has previously threatened tougher measures against Putin, but each time has allowed deadlines to pass without action. Speaking in Helsinki on Monday, Costa said the EU and US were “coordinating our efforts to align our sanctions, to be more effective” and to increase pressure on Putin to join peace negotiations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said the EU needed to increase sanctions on Russia, “but also secondary sanctions” on countries buying gas and oil from Russia. A bar graph showing the number of daily missile and drone strikes in Ukraine The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, “which show further escalation”, a German government spokesperson said on Monday. The spokesperson also said Germany would welcome the US joining Europe in pushing for more sanctions against Russia. In a coordinated move, France and Germany have proposed further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy revenues, including listing non-sanctioned oil majors, such as privately owned Lukoil, as well as going after refineries in foreign countries that re-export Russian oil to the EU. The EU’s two key players also propose increasing pressure on Russia’s civilian economy, via measures targeting civil aviation and engineering. “Russia continues its stalling tactics and persists in refusing a ceasefire,” said a Franco-German paper that calls for increased pressure. Over the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested the US and EU could impose tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil. Bessent said the US was preparing to increase pressure on Russia and urged Europe to do more: “We need our European partners to follow us, because if the US and EU can do this together … we are in a race now between how long the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.” The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India in response to its purchases of discounted Russian oil, but declined to take such punitive action against other large buyers of Russian energy, such as China. The issue of secondary sanctions, which would apply penalties to third countries that trade with Russia, could be difficult for the EU, which is racing to sign new trade deals, including with India, by the end of the year to counter Trump’s tariffs that are roiling international relations. The US focus on Russian energy also puts an uncomfortable spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, favour Trump’s agenda but are also friendly to Putin and have opposed EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028 . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU has pledged to buy $750bn of US oil, gas and nuclear products by 2028. The EU has approved 18 rounds of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, with further proposals expected in the coming days. The last set of EU sanctions, agreed in July, lowered the price cap on Russian oil, closed loopholes to reduce trade in Russian petroleum products and banned vessels carrying Russian energy from European ports. Speaking alongside Costa, Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said cooperation with the US on sanctions was crucial. The latest attacks on Ukraine showed, he said, “that Putin will not stop killing, he will not go to the negotiation tables. That is why we have to cooperate with and negotiate with the US to find a way to do more sanctions, stronger sanctions, do more military support to Ukraine, and build security arrangements to Ukraine.” View image in fullscreen The European Council president, Antonio Costa (left), and the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, during their joint press conference on Monday. Photograph: Roni Rekomaa/AP On Sunday Russia launched its largest-ever barrage on Ukraine , setting the main government building in Kyiv on fire, and killing at least four people, including a woman and her baby. Zelenskyy said Putin was testing the world to see “whether they will accept or tolerate this” and he urged Ukraine’s allies to impose more sanctions and “tough tariffs” on Russia. The Kremlin said on Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on Ukraine. Europe and Ukraine are doing everything they can to draw the US into their orbit, said the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov.

Speaking on Monday in front of parliament's public accounts committee, Davie said the BBC would \"work with\" Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), on the issue. \"Eurovision has never been about politics, it should be a celebration of music and culture that brings people together. We need to see what the broadcast union decides,\" he added. Fellow broadcasters from Ireland , the Netherlands , Slovenia, Iceland and now Spain have all threatened to boycott the event if Israel is allowed to take part over the country's actions in Gaza. \"We're very aware of the concerns,\" the BBC boss told the committee. \"It's obviously a well-debated topic and difficult. \"At this stage we are supportive of the European Broadcast Union's work. They are going around discussing with members, working through all the processes by which they would be satisfied to make a decision one way or the other.\" He added that it was \"really important... that we try to preserve\" the celebratory element of the contest. \"But at this stage, I'm supporting the European Broadcasting Union's work, and they need to get on with it.\" Earlier this year, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the 2025 competition in Basel, which Austrian singer JJ won after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. As a result, next summer's event will be held in the Austrian capital of Vienna. Getty Images Next summer's Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna, Austria Spain's Culture Minister Ernest Urtasun has now said Israel should not take part in the next Eurovision, repeating calls made by the country's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, earlier this year. In 2024, Spain joined Norway and Ireland in acknowledging a Palestinian state and last week, Sánchez accused Israel of genocide and announced a series of measures against it, including an arms embargo. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar responded by accusing Sanchez's administration of being antisemitic and of using \"wild and hateful rhetoric\". In August, the UN-backed food monitor, the IPC, confirmed that famine was taking place in parts of Gaza. Israel is accused of causing the famine through ongoing restrictions on food and medical aid entering the territory. Israel controls all border crossings into the Gaza Strip, and as the occupying power bears responsibility for protecting civilian life under international law, which includes the prevention of starvation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Political messages Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. The EBU said at the time that Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\". Before making this decision, the EBU said it had taken time to consult widely among its membership. Ukraine went on to win the contest. Eurovision is loved for its camp pop hits, soaring ballads and everything inbetween. But over the years, artists have used their platform to send subtle - and not so subtle - political messages. In 2023, Switzerland sent an anti-war song, Watergun, while Iceland were fined €5,000 back in 2019 for flying a Palestinian flag during the competition. In 2016, Ukraine also won the event with a song called 1944 about the ethnic cleansing of Crimean Tatars in that year by Soviet forces.

In his acceptance speech, the 52-year-old, who grew up in the Merseyside town, said: \"This kind of thing doesn't happen to a kid like me.\" Adolescence saw Graham play Eddie Miller, the father of a teenage boy accused of killing a female schoolmate. The star, who was named outstanding lead actor, also paid tribute to his children and wife Hannah Walters who he described as his \"rock\" and \"soulmate\". The series scooped six trophies at the awards, including one for outstanding supporting actor which was won by Owen Cooper who, at just 15, became the youngest-ever male Emmy winner for his breakout performance in Adolescence. Netflix Stephen Graham played Eddie Miller, the father of a 13-year-old boy accused of murder Graham is mixed race, with Jamaican heritage on his father's side. Speaking on BBC's Desert Island Discs in 2019 he talked about how, growing up, he had felt \"slightly unsure where I fitted in\" and how his stepfather, who is also mixed race, taught him about his cultural heritage. He said his stepfather - who he affectionately calls \"Pops\" - had supported his desire to become an actor and would regularly take him to Quarry Green video shop in Kirkby which Graham said was the start of his love affair with films. After cutting his teeth at the Everyman Youth Theatre in Liverpool, Graham found widespread fame with his performance in Shane Meadows' 2006 film This Is England before going on to star on the big and small screen on both sides of the Atlantic. He has also previously spoken openly about attempting suicide and how his family, friends and love helped him to \"slowly come round to the understanding that it was okay; life was worth living\".

Speaking to the Guardian while on a trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, he said: \"I don't believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.\" His comments came just days after a short meeting with his father , King Charles, their first meeting in over a year. It was the first time the pair had met since February 2024. The prince, who also appeared with his wife in the 2022 Netflix series Harry and Meghan, also spoke about his upcoming legal case against the Daily Mail's publisher, Associated Newspapers, at the High Court in London. He is suing them over allegations of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering along with Sir Elton John, Baroness Lawrence and other public figures. Associated Newspapers has denied claims that it hacked phones, calling them \"preposterous smears\". \"It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,\" said the Prince, who now lives in the US but returned to the UK last week to attend a series of events related to causes he supports. Underlining his \"love\" for the UK, he suggested he would like to return home to see his family more often. He added that for the coming year, \"the focus really has to be on my dad.\" Reuters Prince Harry laid a wreath in Maidan Square in the centre of Kyiv The aim of Prince Harry's visit to the Ukrainian capital was to promote the work of his Invictus Games Foundation and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of thousands of veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago. \"Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities,\" he said. \"It's about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.\" After having laid a wreath in memory of the dead, he described the conflict as \"all so unnecessary.\" His work for Invictus, he said, had helped to give him a renewed \"purpose\" after his military career ended, adding that it \"saved me\". He spoke to the British newspaper about the cost of war and how he boxes to relieve stress - punching a punch bag - as well as his portrayal in the media. He stressed that while he felt he had been \"destroyed by certain members of the British press\", he also still felt a lot of love from the British public. In January, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and apologised to him settle a long-running legal battle over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.

RAF Typhoon jets will fly air defence missions over Poland as part of the military alliance's mission to bolster the eastern flank. Other allies including Denmark, Germany and France are already taking part - a jet from the latter was scrambled earlier on Monday in response to another potential incursion by Russian drones. Nato said that alert was quickly over. Tensions have risen across Europe since Poland accused Russia of the incident, which saw 19 drones enter its territory. Moscow has insisted the incident was not deliberate. The Typhoons will still operate out of RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and are expected to start flying missions in the coming days, supported by RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft. They will join Danish F-16s, French Rafales and German Eurofighters. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"The message to Moscow is clear. Putin tested Nato, Nato responded with unity, and the UK will play our full part. When we are threatened, we respond together.\" He also described Russia's actions as \"reckless, dangerous, and unprecedented\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Typhoons joining the mission - named Eastern Sentry - was \"vital in deterring aggression, securing NATO airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies\". Drones and missiles have occasionally veered into countries bordering Ukraine, including Poland, during Russia's full-scale invasion - but this was the most serious incident of its kind and the first time a Nato member has directly engaged Russian drones since the war began in February 2022. Healey said Russia was testing Nato's air defences, while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \"the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two\". In a separate incident on Sunday, Romania - also a Nato member - said a Russian drone had breached its airspace. Romanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said. The drone later disappeared from the radar and did not pose imminent danger, the ministry added. Initial indications suggest the drones fired into Polish airspace last week were Gerbera 'decoy' drones rather than armed ones. There were no casualties. The incident led Poland to invoke Nato's Article 4, which allows member countries to bring any issues of concern - especially related to security - to the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main political decision-making body. Soon after those talks on 10 September, Nato confirmed it would boost defences on its eastern flank. On other occasions over the past 18 months, the RAF has deployed Typhoons to both Poland and Romania to protect Nato airspace, according to the Ministry of Defence.

Between 110,000 and 150,000 people turned out for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson's Unite the Kingdom rally on Saturday, with around 5,000 involved in an anti-racism counter-demonstration. The Met initially said 25 people had been arrested for a range of offences in what it described as \"wholly unacceptable\" violence, but revised that number to 24 on Sunday. Eight people are facing charges including assault and public order offences. The force has also issued photos of 11 people who officers are trying to trace in relation to the disorder. It said it had deployed 1,000 officers to police the operation and drafted in an extra 500 from other forces including Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Devon and Cornwall. In addition to the charges, the Met said one person received a caution and 11 people were bailed under investigation to return at a later date. Three of those arrested were women, the rest were men, the force added.

There are giant explosions as Sukhoi-34 bombers drop guided bombs. Huge plumes of smoke darken the sky. The whole area echoes to the sound of exploding mortar and artillery shells. Helicopter gunships join the attack, while surveillance drones sweep overhead to view the damage. It's only an exercise, though. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says the drills come at a time of \"high tension\" Together with other international media we've been brought to the Borisovsky training ground where Belarusian and Russian forces are taking part in joint manoeuvres. It's part of the Zapad-2025 (\"West 2025\") military drills. Military attachés, too, from a variety of embassies are observing the drill from a viewing platform. These are planned exercises - \"West 2025\" takes place every four years. In 2022 200,000 troops took part, while this year's exercises involved fewer soldiers. Moscow and Minsk maintain that the drills are of a purely defensive nature, that they're designed to strengthen the security of Russia and Belarus and to counter any potential external threat. I remember hearing similar claims three and a half years ago. In February 2022 I visited Belarus to report on the Belarusian-Russian military exercise \"Union Resolve\". When the exercise was over, instead of returning home Russian troops invaded neighbouring Ukraine from the territory of Belarus. This time Belarus insists it has nothing to hide. Representatives of 23 states, including the US, Turkey and Hungary, watched the military exercise. \"We consider that the exercise is unprecedented in its transparency,\" Major General Valery Revenko, assistant to the Belarusian defence minister, told journalists at the training ground. \"We are not threatening anyone. We are for constructive and pragmatic dialogue.\" Clearly Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk isn't convinced. He had dubbed the \"West 2025\" drills \"very aggressive\". Poland shut its border with Belarus ahead of the exercises, prompting an angry response from Minsk. \"West 2025\" coincides with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European region. To the south, Russia shows no sign of ending its war on Ukraine. Last week Poland accused Russia of intentionally violating its air space with a Russian drone incursion. Nato scrambled fighter jets to shoot down some of the drones. Moscow responded by claiming that it \"hadn't planned to engage targets on Polish territory.\" Yesterday Romania revealed that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, too. In Europe there is widespread concern that such drone incursions are no accident , but a Russian strategy to test the unity and resolve of European leaders and of the Nato alliance. Both Russia and Belarus have made efforts recently to improve ties with Washington and to construct a relationship with the Trump administration. But in the case of both Moscow and Minsk relations with Europe remain strained. The decision by the Belarusian authorities to invite international media to the \"West 2025\" exercise can be seen two ways. First, as an attempt at transparency - that's certainly how Minsk is portraying it. But in the explosions and the gunfire on the Borisovsky training ground there is, perhaps too, a message for the West. And first and foremost, for Europe. That message may read something like this: \"See and consider the firepower on your doorstep; confrontation with Moscow is not in your best interest.\" As Russian army inches closer, Ukrainians must decide to stay or go Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia War in Ukraine Belarus Russia Related Belarus and Russia stage joint military drills Romania becomes second Nato country to report Russian drone in its airspace Trump 'ready' to sanction Russia if Nato nations stop buying its oil More from the BBC 1 hr ago UK fighters to defend Polish skies after Russian drone incursion Tensions have risen across Europe after 19 drones entered Poland's territory earlier this month 1 hr ago 3 days ago New Nato mission to bolster eastern flank after Russia drone incursion France, Denmark and Germany will send jets to Poland after Russian drones flew into its airspace. 3 days ago 3 days ago As Russian army inches closer, Ukrainians must decide to stay or go In Bilozerske, eastern Ukraine, people must make the agonising decision to flee or risk staying. 3 days ago 3 days ago UK says 'great news' British national freed in Belarus release deal Julia Fenner was given a long jail term after being detained while entering Belarus in March 2024. 3 days ago 3 days ago Ukraine strikes key Russian oil terminal in massive drone attack The overnight attack is the largest since May, but follows much larger bombardments from Russia. 3 days ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

It was not a rubber bullet. If you see my son, his head was broken, a hole is there.\" Narendra Shrestha wants to know who will take responsibility for the death of his son Sulov, who was among scores killed in violent unrest that rocked Nepal last week. Mr Shrestha, 45, is perched outside the gates of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital's mortuary in the capital. He's already been inside and identified 21-year-old Sulov's body. \"I want to ask this country,\" he says, choking back tears, \"if they can fire, they can shoot my son, then I and his mother, will also stand. Who will we live for now? We also want to die.\" A female family member sits beside him, holding his hand, while a man protects him from the beating sun with an umbrella. Other families were also waiting to identify their young loved ones whose lives were cut short: one had dreamed of being a judge, another was a student working in a Kathmandu hotel, a third was learning French. They are among more than 70 people who died in anti-corruption protests at the start of last week, which toppled the government of the Himalayan nation. More than 1,000 were injured in the two days of unrest. Pritam Roy Narendra Shrestha says his son was shot in the head: \"Who will we live for now?\" A ban on social media was the impetus for the protests, but anger against government corruption had been building in recent weeks. By the time the ban was reversed late on Monday, 8 September, the protests had swelled into a wider movement. Crowds torched politicians' homes and official buildings as an outpouring of anger at the ruling class boiled over. Many of those killed were shot - police are accused of opening fire on the crowds. But others were burned in fires or died in confrontations with police. Casualty figures have been going up as authorities clean up the debris. In response to the allegations, Nepal's police have said they will investigate what happened during those two days of violent protests. It's still unclear who gave the orders for security forces to open fire. Family handout There are several families like Mr Shrestha's waiting outside the mortuary for their names to be called so they can identify the bodies. One man, Rasik KC, is waiting for the body of his 22-year-old nephew, Rashik Khatiwada. Rashik was shot twice in the chest, Mr KC says. He found out about the death after seeing clips on social media. His anguish has now turned to anger, demanding some kind of accountability from the government. \"We want justice,\" he says. Family handout Abhishek Chaulagain, 22, was shot in the forehead The BBC spoke with more than a dozen people who lost family members in the protests. The relatives of Subash Bohora, 21, said there was a time in his life when he wanted to be a judge. He died outside Nepal's parliament building after a bullet pierced his neck. Ayush Thapa, 19, was a French language student who was interested in the British Army and hated Nepali politicians, his family says. He was shot in the chest. Abishek Chaulagain, 22, was a student working in one of the capital's hotels when he was shot in the forehead. \"We had never come across a disaster like this,\" says Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu. She says they treated more than 450 patients in their emergency room during the protests. Six people died. \"Our hospital [has been] in operation for 17 years. We were able to manage patients during the earthquake. [This] situation was worse.\" On the first night of protests, Dr Santosh Paudel was working at Bir Hospital, not far from the parliament building. Of the 173 patients his team treated in the hospital's emergency ward, five died and four are still in critical condition. Dr Paudel says he was surprised to see patients with \"sharp rifle injuries\" in addition to rubber bullets. \"We saw [two types of bullets] clearly, the long one, which is fired by shotguns, and the small ones with the sharp edge that is fired from rifles,\" said Dr Paudel. He said many of the patients that came later in the day had multiple bullet injuries. Pritam Roy Parliament was attacked and images of it set ablaze were seen around the world Protests began last Monday when thousands heeded a call by demonstrators describing themselves as Generation Z to gather near parliament in Kathmandu over the decision to ban platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, as well as over wider dissatisfaction with the government. Ministers said police had to use force, which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Saying they'd failed to register locally, the government announced social media platforms needed to be regulated to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. But popular platforms such as Instagram have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business – and protesters accused the government of trying to silence them. By Tuesday, violent crowds were setting fire to government buildings in the capital Kathmandu. Parliament was torched even though Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already resigned. Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki has a tough road ahead. Not only does the 73-year-old former chief justice need to appoint a new cabinet, she must rebuild confidence in the country's leadership. She has agreed to fresh elections on 5 March 2026, but the first real test of her new government will be her investigation into the protests and if she can bring the perpetrators of the deadly violence – including those who shot protesters, as well as those behind the widespread vandalism – to justice. Pritam Roy \"International law says they are not allowed to shoot,\" says Abishek Shrestha, 22, from his hospital bed, his home for the next month. Metal rods protrude from the white and pink gauze wrapped around his right leg, where he was shot. \"I'm Nepali and they are not allowed to shoot me, but they shot me. It's all because of the government, police, rules and regulation. We have to change this.\" An investigation is little comfort to Mr Shrestha as he mourns Sulov. \"Politicians, they will say sorry. Sorry doesn't make a dead son come alive again.\" Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated Asia Nepal Related Private zoo run by billionaire Ambani family cleared of 'foul play' India's top court suspends parts of contentious Muslim property law Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager More from the BBC 1 day ago Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Sushila Karki said the government must heed protesters' demands for \"an end to corruption, good governance and economic equality\". 1 day ago 2 days ago Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated The House of Representatives was dissolved by the country's president, following deadly anti-corruption protests. 2 days ago 3 days ago Nepal gets first female PM after deadly unrest Former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki is sworn in after a deal with protest leaders. 3 days ago 4 days ago Worried migrants head home from India after Nepal turmoil Nepalis rush home from India as deadly protests have engulfed the Himalayan nation. 4 days ago 4 days ago See Kathmandu's destroyed and barricaded streets after violence There's an intense military presence on the Nepali capital's streets, says the BBC's Samira Hussain. 4 days ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

Is it approaching a \"South Africa moment\", when a combination of political pressure, economic, sporting and cultural boycotts helped to force Pretoria to abandon apartheid? Or can the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu weather the diplomatic storm, leaving Israel free to pursue its goals in Gaza and the occupied West Bank without causing permanent damage to its international standing? Two former prime ministers, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have already accused Netanyahu of turning Israel into an international pariah. Thanks to a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, the number of countries Netanyahu can travel to without the risk of being arrested has shrunk dramatically. At the UN, several countries, including Britain, France, Australia, Belgium and Canada, have said they are planning to recognise Palestine as a state next week. And Gulf countries, reacting with fury to last Tuesday's Israeli attack on Hamas leaders in Qatar , have been meeting in Doha to discuss a unified response, with some calling on countries which enjoy relations with Israel to think again. But with images of starvation emerging from Gaza over the summer and the Israeli army poised to invade - and quite possibly destroy - Gaza City, more and more European governments are showing their displeasure in ways that go beyond mere statements. Reuters The Israeli military is continuing with its offensive in Gaza despite international condemnation At the start of the month, Belgium announced a series of sanctions, including a ban on imports from illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a review of procurement policies with Israeli companies and restrictions on consular assistance to Belgians living in settlements. It also declared two hardline Israeli government ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, persona non grata, along with Jewish settlers accused of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Other countries, including Britain and France, had already taken similar steps. But sanctions on violent settlers imposed by the Biden administration last year were scrapped on Donald Trump's first day back in the White House. A week after Belgium's move, Spain announced its own measures, turning an existing de facto arms embargo into law, announcing a partial import ban, barring entry to Spanish territory for anyone involved in genocide or war crimes in Gaza, and prohibiting Israel-bound ships and aircraft carrying weapons from docking at Spanish ports or entering its airspace. Israel's combative foreign minister, Gideon Saar, accused Spain of advancing antisemitic policies and suggested that Spain would suffer more than Israel from the arms trade ban. EPA Some countries have sought to target far-right Israeli lawmakers Itamar Ben-Gvir (l) and Bezalel Smotrich But there are other alarming signs for Israel. In August, Norway's vast $2tn (1.7tn euros; £1.6tn) sovereign wealth fund announced it would start divesting from companies listed in Israel. By the middle of the month, 23 companies had been removed and finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said more could follow. Meanwhile, the EU, Israel's largest trading partner, plans to sanction far-right ministers and partly suspend trade elements of its association agreement with Israel. In her 10 September State of the Union speech, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said events in Gaza had \"shaken the conscience of the world\". A day later, 314 former European diplomats and officials wrote to von der Leyen and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas calling for tougher measures, including a full suspension of the association agreement. One feature of the sanctions levelled at South Africa between the 1960s and the end of apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the white minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority - in the 1990s was a series of cultural and sporting boycotts. Again, there are signs of this starting to happen with Israel. The Eurovision Song Contest might not sound like a significant event in this context, but Israel has a long and illustrious history with the competition, winning it four times since 1973. For Israel, participation is symbolic of the Jewish state's acceptance among the family of nations. But Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Slovenia have all said, or hinted, that they will withdraw in 2026 if Israel is allowed to compete , with a decision expected in December. EPA Israel has been a Eurovision regular since the 1970s but some countries have threatened to boycott next year's competition In Hollywood, a letter calling for a boycott of Israeli production companies, festivals and broadcasters \"that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people\" has attracted more than 4,000 signatures in a week, including household names like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem. Tzvika Gottlieb, CEO of the Israeli Film and TV Producers Association, called the petition \"profoundly misguided\". \"By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us,\" he said. Then there is sport. The Vuelta de Espana cycling race was repeatedly disrupted by groups protesting the presence of the Israel-Premier Tech team, forcing a messy, premature end on Saturday and the cancellation of the podium ceremony. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called the protests a source of \"pride\", but opposition politicians said government actions had caused international embarrassment. Also in Spain, seven Israeli chess players withdrew from a tournament after being told they would not be able to compete under their flag. The Israeli government's response to what the media have already dubbed a \"diplomatic tsunami\" has generally been defiant. Netanyahu accused Spain of a \"blatant genocidal threat\" after its prime minister said his country, lacking nuclear bombs, aircraft carriers or large oil reserves, was not able to stop Israel's offensive in Gaza by itself. After Belgium announced its sanctions, Gideon Saar wrote on X that it was \"regrettable that even when Israel is fighting an existential threat, which is in Europe's vital interest, there are those who can't resist their anti-Israeli obsession\". Reuters The Vuelta, one of cycling's major annual races, was repeatedly disrupted by pro-Palestinian protests But among those who have represented Israel abroad, there is deep anxiety. Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel's ambassador to Germany from 2017 to 2021, told me he could not recall Israel's international standing being so \"impaired\", but said many of the moves were \"regrettable\" as they were inevitably being seen as targeting all Israelis. \"Instead of singling out the policies of the government, it's alienating a lot of Israelis in the middle ground.\" He said some steps, like recognising the state of Palestine, were likely to prove counterproductive, as it \"gives ammunition to people like Smotrich and Ben Gvir and even enhances their argument to annex [the West Bank]\". Despite his fears, the former ambassador does not believe Israel's diplomatic isolation is irreversible. \"We're not in a South African moment, but we're in a possible preamble to a South African moment,\" he said. Others believe more profound change is needed to halt Israel's slide towards pariah status. \"We have to regain our place in the family of nations,\" another former diplomat, Ilan Baruch, told me. \"We need to get back to our senses.\" Baruch, who was ambassador in South Africa a decade after the end of apartheid, resigned from the diplomatic service in 2011, saying he was no longer able to defend Israel's occupation. Since retiring, he's been a vocal critic of the government and supporter of a two-state solution. He believes recent sanctions are necessary, saying: \"That's how South Africa was pushed to its knees.\" Reuters Israel maintains the backing of the US, whose Secretary of State Marco Rubio is visiting this week Baruch continued: \"I would say that assertive pressure on Israel in any way the Europeans believe is at their disposal should be welcome.\" If necessary, he said, this should include changes to visa regimes and cultural boycotts, adding: \"I'm prepared for the pain.\" But for all the expressions of outrage and talk of pressure, some veteran observers doubt Israel is on the edge of a diplomatic precipice. \"Those who are willing to go down the Spanish route are still outliers,\" Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, told me. He said efforts to take collective action within the EU – scrapping elements of the association agreement or even, as some have suggested, freezing Israel out of the EU's Horizon research and innovation programme – are unlikely to garner sufficient support, with Germany, Italy and Hungary among members resisting such moves. Israel also still has the staunch backing of the US, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Washington's \"relationship with Israel is going to remain strong\" as he departed for an official visit. Levy still believes Israel's international isolation is \"irreversible\" but says the Trump administration's continued support means it has not yet reached the point where it can change the course of events in Gaza. \"Netanyahu is running out of road,\" Levy said. \"But we haven't hit the end of the road yet.\" Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders 'Netanyahu, we're not leaving': Defiance in Gaza City as Israel shows aid sites planned for evacuees Bowen: Diplomacy in ruins after Israel strikes Hamas leaders in Qatar Middle East Israel-Gaza war Israel Benjamin Netanyahu Related Qatar hosts Arab-Islamic emergency summit over Israeli strike on Doha Rubio in Israel as IDF destroys more Gaza City buildings Greta Thunberg's Gaza flotilla hit by drones, organisers claim More from the BBC 2 hrs ago Critically ill children arrive in Scotland from Gaza The Scottish government has committed to supporting the treatment of up to 20 Palestinian youngsters. 2 hrs ago 4 hrs ago Israel demolishes more high-rise towers as Gaza City offensive ramps up BBC Verify's Merlyn Thomas looks at the latest Israeli strikes on buildings in Gaza City city over the weekend. 4 hrs ago 4 hrs ago Netanyahu does not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders At a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu said every country had the right \"to defend itself beyond its borders\". 4 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sport Pedro Sánchez says Israel should be treated in the same way as Russia over its war in Ukraine. 5 hrs ago 1 day ago Netanyahu is only obstacle to bringing hostages home, families say Their intervention comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives in Israel to meet the Israeli PM. 1 day ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects. \"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company. He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs. \"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\" Bloomberg via Getty Images American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, in part due to economic tensions with China His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops. American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July. With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening. Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis. Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular. 'I'm in a little bit of a worried place:' Tim Maxwell owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa Mr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says. \"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\" So why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy? Farmers on a 'trade and financial precipice' If you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days. There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar. But when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs. Anna Jones at the Iowa State Fair where there was much talk about the impact of tariffs \"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine. \"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\" In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China. In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China. Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock. September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year. The Iowa State Fair attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. \"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\" The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser. Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States… \"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke. \"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\" Farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", sell a huge number of crops to China American farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency. In a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\" Trump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day' Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture. And they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance. In his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\" Getty Images Supporters of Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\". \"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\" And it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. But he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts. \"That is a problem.\" Tariffs will make us great again There's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances. Yet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump. Experts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole. Though a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small. \"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics. At Iowa's State Fair, many of the conversations revolved around Trump and tariffs (pictured: attendee John Wilson with Judah the Big Ram) For some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run. \"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa. \"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\" Some may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China. A case of selective blame attribution? For Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play. \"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\" Starting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change. What he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\". Bloomberg via Getty Images Rural America: the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump, says one expert Some repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\". \"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". Ms Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\" Prof Shepherd, of the University of Michigan, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side. He calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\" 'We're giving him a chance - there'd better be results' Mr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\" But he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return. Many of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support. 'A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,' farmer Gil Gullickson (left). 'But history proves that tariffs don't end well' Mr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under. Back at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear. \"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less. \"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\" Listen to Corn Belt People on BBC Radio 4 at 4pm bst on Monday 15 September Additional reporting: Florence Freeman Trump is used to shaking off criticism - but the Epstein story is different The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation How Trump is using the courts to get what he wants - and changing the shape of presidential power Trump tariffs Agriculture Iowa Rural life Donald Trump US politics Related China accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly laws Brazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffs AstraZeneca pauses £200m Cambridge investment More from the BBC 2 hrs ago Marine officers search river ahead of Trump visit Specialist marine officers increase patrols ahead of the US president's visit to Windsor. 2 hrs ago 4 hrs ago Trump renews push to end companies' quarterly reports The US president urges regulators to adopt a semi-annual schedule for financial reports. 4 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Democratic New York governor endorses Zohran Mamdani for NYC mayor Some establishment Democrats have been uneasy about the 33-year-old's left-wing platform. 5 hrs ago 6 hrs ago Trump says Venezuela 'sending drugs, gang members' as tensions rise Tension has been running high between the two countries since the US deployed war ships to the South Caribbean. 6 hrs ago 11 hrs ago Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 11 hrs ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

Here's how to fix it 20 hours ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save BBC When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks. Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode. This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness. Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, and conditions such as long Covid and autoimmune conditions like lupus disease, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind at once. Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze. 1. Be kind to yourself Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping. Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched. Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it. If you are concerned then you should contact your GP. 2. Create routines Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory. Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\" It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making. 3. Take breaks Getty Images Taking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focus It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room. But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely. Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly. Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next. 4. Use calendars and reminders Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness. Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space. Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores. This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\" Swans Getty Images Staying hydrated and eating whole foods can help clear brain fog Alongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen focus. Each letter stands for a key habit that can help clear the mental mist and keep your mind performing at its best: Sleep: Sleep is non-negotiable - it gives your brain time to rest and consolidate memories. Aim for between seven and nine hours each night. Water: Our bodies are about 60% water and even mild dehydration can make you feel unfocused so keep water nearby and sip it regularly Activity : Moving your body boosts blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps you think more clearly. Try going on short walks, a light jog or regularly stretching Nutrition: Nourish your brain with whole foods rather than processed ones. Choline is a nutrient vital for brain health so eating food that is rich in it like eggs, fish and nuts can support concentration and focus. Stress: Chronic stress floods the body with cortisol - a hormone that helps regulate your body's response to stress - and that can cloud your thinking. Find ways to lower stress through breathing exercises, mindfulness and hobbies. Use the NHS website to find out more about brain fog and how to manage it. Feeling stressed?

Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request. Outside of the UK you can watch on YouTube One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her. Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations. Warsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022 Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business. Mr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver \"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run. Troy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa He says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022. Instagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died Monic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation. Instagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building Kayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us. Monic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life For Monic's family, grief is now tangled with fear. Fear for other families who could suffer the same loss they have, if nothing is done. \"We are all looking at Monica's death,\" her relative Michael told us. \"But who is there for the girls still alive? They're still there. Still suffering.\" The BBC asked Charles \"Abbey\" Mwesigwa to respond to all the allegations made in our investigation. He denied running an illegal prostitution ring. He said: \"These are all false allegations. \"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it.\" He also said: \"[Monic] died with her passport meaning no-one was demanding her money for taking her. Prior to her death, I hadn't seen her for over four to five weeks. \"I knew [Monic and Kayla] and [they] were renting with different landlords. If no-one in both flats was arrested or any of the landlords, then there was a reason. Both incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and maybe they can help you.\" The BBC contacted Al Barsha Police Station to request to see the case files for Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi. It did not respond to that request or to allegations Monica and Kayla's deaths had not been properly investigated. The BBC was unable to see any toxicology reports in relation to Monic Karungi, or speak to the landlord of the apartment in which she was living when she died.

The retailer fell into administration on 5 September and immediately closed 32 of its 147 shops with the loss of 450 jobs. Another 235 staff will be affected by the closures this week, which brings the total to 685 staff losing their jobs since the company collapsed. A spokesperson for the administrators said the business was up for sale and there had been \"interest from a number of parties\" in relation to some of the remaining 85 stores, the future of which it hoped to secure. The company's administrators have now said another 14 stores will close on Tuesday while 16 more will shut on Thursday. \"Unfortunately, however, given the shortage of stock and costs associated with operating stores, it is no longer viable to continue to trade all 115 stores retained on appointment,\" the spokesperson said. Until it entered administration, the firm employed about 1,500 people. The administrators previously said the stores had become too expensive to maintain amidst rising rents, with retailers facing \"challenging times\". Nick Holloway, managing director at Interpath and joint administrator, said: \"We'd like to express our sincere thanks to the hundreds of dedicated Bodycare staff who have shown such professionalism since our appointment. \"We will continue to trade the remaining 85 stores while we remain in discussions with interested parties with the aim of preserving as much of the business as possible.\" Bodycare was founded in Lancashire in 1970. Its store layouts are known for their bright lighting and window displays that often feature piles of toilet tissue or pyramids of washing up powder. It also offers warehouse-style display shelves packed with goods such as lip balm, perfume, false nails and foot cream.

Lauren King, whose six-year-old Bebe King was the youngest of three children murdered in the attack on a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July 2024, told the hearing at Liverpool Town Hall that the inquiry needed to \"face the truth\" and deliver \"real change\". The inquiry - set up to examine the history of their killer and his contact with various agencies - also heard from the parents of Alice Aguiar, nine, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven. They described how their lives had been shattered by the loss of their beloved daughters. Warning: This report contains distressing information Eight other children and two adults were seriously wounded during the attack at a dance studio in Hart Street. Earlier this month, the inquiry heard evidence from some of those who had survived. Family photos Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Aguiar were murdered in the attack on 29 July 2024 Monday had been earmarked as a day for the parents of the three murdered girls to address the inquiry. Jenni and David Stancombe, Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar, and Lauren and Ben King all fought through tears and sat side-by-side in the witness box as their statements were delivered. Mrs King, 42, described Bebe as \"joyful\", \"hilarious\" and \"magical\", and said her bond with her daughter had been \"spiritual\". Her voice rose in anger as she demanded \"accountability\". \"This was preventable,\" she said. \"And no other child, no other family, no other community should ever endure what we now live with every single day.\" She described the desperate hours after she and Mr King were told a man had attacked the dance studio - including \"hours walking around in the intense heat\" not knowing whether Bebe was alive. Mrs King said they had been standing in the street, in public, when they were first told Bebe had been killed. \"These are moments no form of therapy can ever resolve,\" she said. PA Media The parents of the three girls murdered on 29 July 2024 gave evidence at a public inquiry She finished by telling the inquiry: \"We will carry her in our hearts for the rest of our lives. \"But those sitting here today carry a responsibility too: to make sure no other child, no other sister, no other family ever suffers what ours has suffered.\" Earlier, a statement from Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar, read by their lawyer Chris Walker, described how their \"little family unit\" had been destroyed when their only daughter was killed. Mrs Aguiar, 34, described a scene of \"panic and terror\" when she arrived to collect Alice. She described \"injured little girls\" all over the car park. She ran into the building, where the killer was still being detained by police, the inquiry heard. \"I saw devastation everywhere, blood smeared on the walls, cries and sobs of little girls in fear and agony from their wounds,\" she said. PA Media Alexandra and Sergio Aguiar (centre) told the inquiry of the scenes of \"panic and terror\" on Hart Street Mrs Aguiar said she had found her daughter outside, where paramedics were tending to her injuries. \"My happy, loving, innocent little girl [was] hurt by a monster,\" she said. Alice was taken to Southport hospital where, after 13 hours, Mr and Mrs Aguiar were told she had not survived her wounds. \"We just hope that she couldn't feel any pain and that she wasn't scared,\" Mrs Aguiar wrote. \"This haunts us both. We live with this thought most days now.\" Jenni Stancombe, 37, told the inquiry her daughter Elsie was \"our joy, our pride, our everything\", adding: \"She just radiated warmth and love to everyone around her.\" She told the inquiry her daughter's death could not be categorised simply as \"knife crime\". \"The issue runs much deeper than the weapon that was used,\" she said. \"It's about the root causes, the drive, the intent, and the series of failures that allowed it to happen.\" PA Media Jenni Stancombe (left) and David Stancombe (right) said their daughter's death could not simply be defined as \"knife crime\". Mrs Stancombe recalled the moment they had received a call to say a man had attacked the dance class, and how they had driven to the scene in their car before abandoning it in the middle of the road. She said two police officers had had to lift Mr Stancombe off his feet to stop him running inside the building. She said they had been able to see the \"devastation\" caused as they searched among the other wounded girls for Elsie. \"What we saw that day will stay with us for the rest of our lives,\" Mrs Stancombe told the inquiry. \"Out of respect for the other victims, I will not go into detail, but it goes without saying; no human being should ever witness what we did that day.\" She said after they had described Elsie's clothing, a police officer confirmed a child inside the building fitting that description \"hadn't made it\". \"David knelt down in front of me and just looked at me. I didn't believe them. I didn't want to believe them,\" she said. \"Elsie's life was stolen, robbed in the most traumatic way.\" The inquiry continues.

Soldiers from the Royal Dragoon Guard, of which she had been deputy colonel in chief, carried the coffin from the royal hearse into the cathedral. The hearse had brought the coffin, draped in the royal standard, from Kensington Palace where the duchess died aged 92 earlier this month, with a piper playing as the hearse left. Her immediate family, including her widower the Duke of Kent and their three children, were there and attended a service marking the reception of the duchess' coffin into the cathedral. PA Media The royal hearse had brought the coffin from Kensington Palace to the cathedral The King and Queen and other senior royals will attend Tuesday's Requiem Mass at the cathedral, the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in Britain's modern history. Music will include \"Ave verum corpus\" by Mozart, which was selected by the duchess as her favourite piece when she was a guest on the BBC's Desert Island Discs in 1989. A piper will play the lament \"Sleep, Dearie, Sleep\", which was played at the funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II. With her family proud of their Yorkshire connections, the wreath on the coffin includes white roses, the emblem of Yorkshire; sprigs of yew from the gardens of Hovingham Hall, her family's home; and other flowers and herbs such as rosemary for remembrance. The duchess, married to the late Queen's first cousin, had been the oldest member of the Royal Family when she died. Many tributes have been paid to her, including from the Prince and Princess of Wales who said she had \"worked tirelessly to help others and supported many causes, including through her love of music\". The duchess had become a primary school music teacher, calling herself Mrs Kent, with the pupils not knowing anything about her royal life. She will also be remembered as a familiar figure at the Wimbledon tennis championships, where she handed over trophies - and consoled those who had lost, including a tearful Jana Novotna in 1993. The coffin will remain in the cathedral's Lady Chapel overnight. The funeral on Tuesday afternoon will be a private family service, after which the coffin will be taken to the royal burial ground in Frogmore in Windsor.

They are the first children to be brought to the UK for treatment as part of a government operation being co-ordinated by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Home Office and Department of Health. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the children had been evacuated from Gaza in an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper. A Foreign Office source told the BBC the report was correct and the children were due to arrive in the UK in the \"coming days\". The UK government is also working to evacuate students with places to study at British universities. Cooper did not confirm how large the first group was but the BBC understands it contains between 30 and 50 Palestinian children . Each child could be accompanied by family members if necessary, according to the Mirror . Cooper told the newspaper \"it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza\". She added: \"But that work is underway and I'm determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn.\" Some Gazan children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government until now had not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict. On Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 47 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day. Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said that Israel's offensive in Gaza had stretched the territory's health system \"beyond breaking point\" . Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths. The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,803 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

He'll get a spectacular royal welcome but no cheering crowds 2 days ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save BBC US President Donald Trump is going to be greeted with a spectacular royal charm offensive during his state visit this week. The aim will be to dazzle and flatter him with the ultimate red-carpet experience, with guards of honour, flypasts, historic carriages, a lavish banquet, pomp and pageantry. In return, Sir Keir Starmer will be hoping this gilt-edged reception will help to deliver the UK's message on awkward issues such as Ukraine and trade tariffs. And if anyone can get the US president's attention and influence him, surely King Charles III and the Royal Family can. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II greeted the President and First Lady on the state visit to the UK in 2019 But how will King Charles handle his sometimes unpredictable guest in Windsor? Can he be the Trump whisperer? \"Trump loves the monarchy and the Royal Family. It's a potential diplomatic ace card for the UK government,\" says Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the modern monarchy at City St George's, University of London. This attraction to royalty will give the King a \"rare advantage\" in dealing with Trump, who usually expects to have the upper hand, says Prof Whitelock. Sir Anthony Seldon, biographer of the UK's prime ministers, agrees. The King can benefit from Trump's \"palpable enthusiasm\" for the royals, he says. \"At the same time, King Charles is in the most delicate of positions. His own known views, on the environment, and standing up for democracy and the rule of law in Europe, are a long way apart from the president's,\" says Sir Anthony. \"He will, I am sure, be scrupulously correct and civil,\" he adds. In essence, the King will stick to the script given to him by the UK government. The government will certainly hope that this week's royal schmooze-fest will make a positive impression on Trump, creating a feelgood factor for the UK. It's an unusual and carefully crafted state visit. There's a crammed schedule squeezed into a day and a half, most of it dedicated to royal spectacles. Windsor is being used like a royal theme park. With fears over security and protests, there won't be any cheering crowds and no public procession, like the one recently enjoyed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Instead, it will be helicopters and closed events, including the carriage ride, which will wind its way inside the Windsor estate. A YouGov poll over the summer showed opinion divided on whether Trump's visit should go ahead , with slightly more wanting it cancelled. And the nearest thing to the public that the president will see will be the staff working at the banquet. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images The King has shown his public support for Ukraine's President Zelensky The King will make a speech in honour of the president at the state banquet in St George's Hall, inside Windsor Castle. He's likely to praise the special relationship and talk of the anniversaries of wartime alliances, perhaps mentioning his mother, the late Queen, and Trump's mother, who so admired royalty. Every word will have been written in close consultation with the government, anxious to hit the right notes. Guests, including many celebrity faces, will dine on a showcase of US and British food, from a menu written in French, with five or six different glasses for each place, in a hall lined with royal portraits and suits of armour. Charles has decades of experience at playing host. Whatever his own private thoughts - and he's not exactly going to be signed up to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" message - the King has a strong sense of duty and will work hard to make this visit a success. Royal author Robert Hardman suggests they'll stick to safe topics - such as talking about the president's Scottish roots. And the royals have, of course, had plenty of visits from people with whom they might not have seen eye-to-eye. Mr Hardman describes how the late Queen Elizabeth II once hid behind a bush rather than bump into Romania's President Caecescu in the palace gardens, during the dictator's state visit in 1978. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images There will be no public carriage rides for the US visit, unlike for President Macron The King is also not alone. The rest of the Royal Family will be deployed to help with the hospitality. All eyes will be on Catherine, the Princess of Wales, and the First Lady, Melania Trump, when they visit a nature project involving the Scouts on Thursday. Trump is also an admirer of Prince William, praising their \"great, great talk\" in France at the re-opening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral. William and Catherine will be an important part of the ceremonial welcome on Wednesday. Queen Camilla will show Melania one of the quirkier items in Windsor, a remarkable dolls' house, made a century ago by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. If things get too tough, the miniature wine bottles in the dolls' house have real drink inside. Getty Images The Princess of Wales at the state banquet for Trump in 2019 While King Charles and Trump might seem contrasting personalities, they're very much known quantities to each other. They're men of the same post-war generation - Trump aged 79 and the King aged 76 - who have overlapped for decades. As far back as the late-1980s, Charles had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. After Trump survived an assassination attempt last July, the King sent him a personal note . They spent time together during Trump's previous state visit in 2019. And it's also not just the two heads of state who have crossed paths, but their families. Before Trump had taken a run at the White House, his businessman brother Robert, who died in 2020, had been a significant donor to Charles's charities, bringing him to royal dinners in the UK, along with other wealthy US socialites. The King's brother, Prince Andrew, had visited Mar-a-Lago in 2000, introducing himself as \"Andrew York\" to guests. Jeffrey Epstein, later convicted as a sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the same party. Prince Andrew will be entirely airbrushed out of this week's visit. But for Trump's 2019 visit, he was described as Buckingham Palace's \"secret weapon\", accompanying the president on two of the three days. That was only a matter of months before the Duke of York's notorious Newsnight interview. Trump clearly relished meeting the late Queen Elizabeth II and he'll pay his respects to her, laying a wreath on her tomb in St George's Chapel. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Sir Keir Starmer handed over the historic invitation to a second state visit Trump's fascination with the monarchy is at the heart of this state visit. As with much about the president, it's about his personality more than his politics. \"I still remember my mother, who is Scottish by birth, sitting in front of the television set to watch Queen Elizabeth's coronation and not budging for an entire day. She was just enthralled by the pomp and circumstance, the whole idea of royalty and glamour,\" Trump recalled in his book The Art of the Deal. \"I also remember my father that day, pacing around impatiently. 'For Christ's sake Mary,' he'd say. 'Enough is enough, turn it off.'\" It seems to be his mother's voice that he listened to. \"A meeting with the Queen of England was the ultimate sign, that he, Trump, had made it in life,\" wrote his former Russia adviser Fiona Hill in her White House memoir. For Trump, getting close to a King or Queen seems to have been the ultimate way for an outsider to become an insider. Offering him a second state visit has been called \"unprecedented\". And it is very rare, although Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik of Denmark also had two, in 1974 and 2000. Since the start of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 1952, there have only been three state visits by US presidents - George W Bush, Barack Obama and Trump - who is the only one who has had two. There have been other presidential trips to the UK, but not fully-fledged state visits. The significance of that shouldn't be underestimated and it reflects how much Trump dominates the international news agenda. For the UK government, his apparent fandom for the royals creates an opportunity to make its own pitch to Trump. Getty Images The King and PM Mark Carney asserted Canada's independence from US claims It's an important moment for King Charles, who used to be criticised for \"meddling\" in politics. Now he's in the unusual position of being actively encouraged to play a role in diplomatic negotiations. Soft power is being applied to tough times. It was the King who embraced Ukraine's President Zelensky after his White House mauling in February. And it was the King who went to Canada in May to show solidarity when it was under pressure from Trump to become his 51st state. Charles appears to have been effective. Former Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Jeremy Kinsman, said the intervention had been \"outstanding\" and Trump seems to have reduced his aggressive rhetoric. The King has also received warm support and standing ovations after speeches to the parliaments of France, Italy and Germany. Charles is a bridge-builder in an era when populist politicians are burning them down. Yet issues such as protecting Ukraine are personally and deeply held by the King. \"I imagine it is an uncomfortable moment for the King,\" adds Mr Kinsman. \"I cannot imagine two men more utterly different in values, purpose, style, and psychology.\" Mr Kinsman, the former professional diplomat, says the King will have been briefed to \"play the genial host and continue to try to charm the US president and impress him with the majesty of the setting\". In turn, he says Trump will be on best behaviour and he will have been briefed and ready for small talk on topics such as organic farming. \"The King will know what to expect and I'm confident he will handle the president very diplomatically,\" royal commentator Pauline Maclaran says. \"The chemistry between them will be very interesting.\" More weekend picks Inside King Charles's fiery gathering that shone a light on his beliefs Prince Andrew book seals his fate for any return King's big moment in Canada after Trump row Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle said marchers were demonstrating freedom of association and freedom of speech, after up to 150,000 joined a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally, organised by Robinson and about 5,000 took part in a counter-protest, co-ordinated by Stand Up To Racism. But he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the \"small minority\" who had committed violence would be held accountable. Police say 26 officers were injured on the day - including four who were seriously hurt - with 24 people arrested. Who is Tommy Robinson? Dozens of officers injured as up to 150,000 join Tommy Robinson rally 'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests Speaking about Saturday's protests, Kyle said moments like these were \"klaxon calls\" for those in power to redouble their efforts to address the big concerns people have, including on immigration. \"What worries me most is the divisions in our society and other societies and other democratic societies... it's not even the left and the right at the moment,\" he told the programme. \"There are figures such as Tommy Robinson that are able to touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in the community in our society,\" he said. \"A lot of it goes back to its roots in the financial crisis and the impact that had on communities around the country, and we haven't been able to bring our communities back together again since,\" Kyle continued. Kyle criticised Elon Musk's comments after he appeared at Saturday's rally via video link telling protesters to \"fight back\" or \"die\". \"I thought that they were slightly incomprehensible comments that were totally inappropriate\", the minister said. The tech billionaire also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK. Met Police officers clash with protesters at Tommy Robinson rally Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, criticised politicians for \"parroting\" his ideas as he addressed the crowds from a stage. He claimed UK courts had decided the rights of undocumented migrants superseded those of the \"local community\", referring to the Court of Appeal decision last month to overturn an injunction blocking asylum seekers being housed at The Bell Hotel in Essex. Central London saw a huge policing operation for the protests this weekend, with around 1,000 officers deployed. Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said officers said: \"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence.\" The protest was largely peaceful on Saturday lunchtime but as the afternoon continued tensions flared. The Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart and dozens of officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt. Protesters joining the march, organised by Robinson, became too big to fit into Whitehall, police said, and confrontation happened when officers tried to stop them encircling counter-protesters. Mounted police officers used batons to push back the crowds and officers were kicked and punched, said the Met. Three of the 24 people arrested were women and the rest were men, while the youngest and oldest people detained at the protest were aged 19 and 58 respectively, the Met said on Sunday. Several people were arrested for more than one offence. The force added officers were working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests \"in the coming days and weeks. The Met said on Saturday morning that they were not going to use live facial recognition cameras during the day. Previously called a \"game-changing tool\" by Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, the technology is used by the force in \"hotspot policing\" and major events like the Notting Hill Carnival. Robinson was released from prison earlier this year after being jailed in October for ignoring an order not to repeat false claims about a Syrian refugee , who had successfully sued him for libel.

The prime minister is believed to have asked Mandelson three questions, via an email sent by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, relating to his friendship with the disgraced financier while he was being considered for the influential role. The questions came after initial vetting of the peer flagged his relationship with Epstein. The revelation is likely to pile further scrutiny on what Sir Keir knew before Mandelson got the job. While his friendship with Epstein was known at the time of his appointment, No 10 said new information about it only came to light this week, prompting his sacking. Downing Street and Mandelson have declined to comment. Mandelson was asked to leave his post on Thursday after a now notorious cache of emails was reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday evening. These included supportive messages Mandelson sent after Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. In one message, Mandelson is reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" and, the day before he began his prison sentence, another which read: \"I think the world of you.\" These emails did not show up in two vetting processes carried out in Whitehall around his appointment. When Mandelson was under consideration for ambassador, the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) prepared a file for the prime minister that contained information about Mandelson and Epstein's links, the BBC has been told. After reviewing the file, No 10 sources say Sir Keir asked Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Peter Mandelson was sacked as UK ambassador to the US this week These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed? It is understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009, while the paedophile was in prison. Another source confirmed Mandelson told Downing Street he had not stayed there. Court documents in 2023 showed Epstein telling his private banker that Mandelson was planning to stay, but the peer has never explicitly denied or confirmed if he did. No 10 sources believe Mandelson was \"economical with the truth\" in his answers to the three questions. However, at the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed which led to a second vetting process, called \"developed vetting\" (DV), being carried out under the auspices of the Foreign Office. The BBC has been told the emails were not available to those in government when Lord Mandelson was appointed, as they came from a defunct email address. A senior Whitehall figure said it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done. The row has led to growing pressure on Sir Keir over his judgement in making Mandelson ambassador, and questions over the extent of what he knew about ties between Mandelson and Epstein. Some Labour MPs in public and private are asking whether Sir Keir should resign, and some are suggesting Number 10 senior aides are to blame. Sources have told the BBC that Mandelson was asked to resign on Wednesday, even though the prime minister had backed him at PMQs. Mandelson refused, and after a \"furious\" Sir Keir read the emails on Wednesday night, a final decision to sack him was taken on Thursday morning. The Cabinet Office has declined to comment. Mandelson has repeatedly expressed regret about his relationship with Epstein who died in jail in 2019.

The 'one in, one out' pilot scheme was set up as part of a deal announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to the UK in July. Dozens of migrants were detained in Dover last month under the agreement and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this week that they are are expected to be returned to France \"imminently\". It is understood that formal removal directions have been issued to asylum seekers to say they will be deported to France within five days. In return, it was agreed that the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers who have not tried to cross and can pass security and eligibility checks. At the announcement in early July, Starmer said the plan was a \"product of months of grown-up diplomacy \" which would \"deliver real results\". Critics, including the Conservatives, argue the policy would prove \"unworkable and wide open to abuse\". It is also understood that MPs will get a chance to question new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on the deal during Home Office questions in Parliament on Monday. As of 13 September, 31,027 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025, up from 22,440 for the same period in 2024. Under the new treaty, published on 4 August , France agreed to take back adults or accompanied children who make a journey to the UK by small boat, once any asylum claim is withdrawn or declared inadmissible. Both countries have agreed to work towards making transfers with three months after small boat arrivals have entered the UK. Former home secretary Yvette Cooper stressed the scheme starting up was a trial . Details of how people will apply to come to the UK from France under the treaty have also been published by the government. Successful applicants will initially be granted the right to come to the UK for three months, to \"consider how to regularise their stay\". Applicants will apply online – but have to submit proof to the Home Office they are applying from within France. The UK has agreed to pay the transportation costs both of those migrants it sends to France, and those it accepts back in return. A decade of small boat migrants: How did it begin? Why do Channel migrants want to come to the UK? Record number of lone children on small boats The policy is part of a number of measures unveiled by the Labour government in an attempt to tackle the small boats crossings from France. In July, it announced that 25 people including gang leaders and small boat suppliers had had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. An extra 300 National Crime Agency officers will target the people-smugglers arranging the crossings, and a new Border Security Command body will work closely with the Home office, police, immigration enforcement and intelligence agencies. The UK is also paying France almost £500m over three years - as agreed by the previous Conservative government - to fund extra officers on the French coast.

The Reform UK leader said the money used to purchase the property was \"legally hers\", adding: \"She bought the house, the deeds are in her name, council tax is in her name.\" It comes after a BBC investigation raised questions over how Farage's partner, Laure Ferrari, could afford to buy the £885,000 home in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, without a mortgage. Farage has denied avoiding more than £44,000 in additional stamp duty on the purchase of the house by putting it in his partner's name, saying that she bought it with her own funds. Stamp duty is a tax paid when buying a property over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. There is a higher rate if the buyer already own another property and this would have been due if Farage had purchased the Clacton house himself. Farage has suggested Ms Ferrari was able to afford the four-bedroom home because she comes from a wealthy French family. However, the BBC has examined French property and company records and has been unable to find evidence that Ms Ferrari's parents have the means to fund their daughter's purchase of the home. Ms Ferrari herself is the director of a consultancy, now called Baxter Laois Limited, which is the registered owner of Farage's gin brand. However, the company's latest accounts show limited activity, with more than £10,000 owed to creditors and just £1,000 in assets. If the Reform leader was the source of funds used for the home, which he has denied, it would be legal for his partner to use them to buy the property in her name and pay the lower rate of stamp duty. But it would open Farage to charges of hypocrisy and seeking to avoid tax, particularly after he criticised former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner last week for avoiding stamp duty . Farage faces questions over who funded £885,000 Clacton constituency home We must be ready for early election, Nigel Farage tells party What is stamp duty? Asked if he earned any of the money used by his partner to buy the house, Farage told reporters on Friday: \"No. No, no, no, listen, can I be clear about this. The money was legally hers, the estate agents and everyone did the know your customer rule checks.\" He added: \"I don't have any financial stake in it whatsoever, other than she lets me stay there but then given that I'm her partner that's not really that unusual.\" Pressed over whether he had given his partner funds at any point, the Clacton MP said: \"I have given every answer to this I want to give. \"I've even been this week to a King's Counsel tax expert and paid a lot of money to make sure that everything we've done is legal and right.\" Asked why he had sought expert tax advice, Farage said he was \"really concerned\" that some media reports were \"beginning to stray into libel territory\". \"So I have now done everything I can at every level to prove that everything that's been done is legal, correct and right,\" he added. \"It's been a very expensive week.\" Following his election as the MP for Clacton last year, Farage claimed in a series of interviews that he had bought a house in his constituency. In response to questions last November about how many times he had been to Clacton, Farage said he had \"just exchanged contracts on a house that I'll be living in there\". It later emerged that the £885,000 home had been bought by his partner Ms Ferrari, who is listed on Land Registry documents as the sole owner. It was bought without borrowing any money for a mortgage. Labour has accused Farage of \"misleading the public\", with party chairwoman Anna Turley previously saying he must \"urgently come clean\" over whether he financially contributed towards the purchase of the house. Farage's solicitors said they had received written advice from a leading King's Counsel tax expert which concluded there was no underpayment of stamp duty and that \"there is no basis to suggest there has been any improper avoidance or evasion of tax in respect of the purchase\".

Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US on Thursday over his links to the late convicted paedophile. The government said the \"depth and extent\" of Mandelson's relationship with the financier had not been known when he was appointed last year. This is the first time financial evidence of Epstein paying for Mandelson's travel has come to light. The BBC has contacted Mandelson for a response. Just months after Mandelson contributed a 10-page note to Epstein's 2003 \"50th birthday book\", in which he referred to Epstein as his \"best pal\" , Epstein paid for Mandelson's travel. It is unclear where and when Mandelson's travel took place. The first travel payment by Epstein is dated 4 April 2003 - before he was convicted in 2008 - and cost $3,844.90. A week later, Epstein paid a further $3,642.06. The travel receipts were among more than the 33,000 Epstein-related records released earlier this month by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee, provided by the Department of Justice. The documents show Epstein's financial account with a New York travel agent, Shoppers Travel Inc, which was used by Epstein to book commercial flights for his associates and employees. Victims also allege to have been flown commercially by Epstein in this way. In emails from October 2005, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, Mandelson is said to have complained to Epstein about a lack of British Airways airmiles and Epstein offered to pay for his Caribbean flight. Mandelson is reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The Labour peer and former cabinet minister also told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before he began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Mandelson does not deny these emails. In a previous statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\" In a letter Mandelson wrote to staff at the British embassy in Washington after being sacked, he said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

Sir Oliver Robbins, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, asked Lord Mandelson about the emails on Tuesday but did not receive a response until the next day. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of lying to the public. She said: \"Looks like the prime minister and Labour MPs spent the week lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson's involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"If No10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement\". Backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake called No 10's reported handling of the situation \"really embarrassing\". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: \"Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails were presented to them clearly has deep failings.\" Blake added: \"Whoever is gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop, and they need to be getting things to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.\" Asked whether Lord Mandelson should be required to leave the House of Lords, Blake said it was something \"we should be considering\". Downing Street later said the prime minister \"strongly\" rejected criticism of the leadership in No 10 from some of his MPs. Starmer maintained full confidence in his \"top team\" and was \"focused on delivering for the country,\" they said. Downing Street also rejected claims the prime minister is failing to engage with MPs, saying he meets with backbenchers \"regularly\" and pointing to a meeting held on Monday night, which they say was \"positive\". Badenoch also said the prime minister had \"very serious questions to answer\". \"The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when,\" she added. Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US shortly before 11:00 on Thursday. Downing Street said the emails contained \"new information\" that was not known at the time of Lord Mandelson's appointment. United States District Court Southern District of New York A picture understood to have been taken on the Caribbean island of St Barts in 2006 The full emails were published by Bloomberg and the Sun on Wednesday evening. \"I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,\" Mandelson wrote the day before Epstein reported to prison in 2008 for soliciting sex from a minor. Mandelson added: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release... Your friends stay with you and love you.\" In an interview with the Sun on Wednesday, Lord Mandelson said he felt a \"tremendous sense of regret\" that he had met Epstein, and that he \"took at face value the lies that he fed me and many others\". The BBC earlier reported that Lord Mandelson's emails were sent from an old account to which he no longer had access. Officials cite this as the reason they had not been seen earlier. In a statement announcing Lord Mandelson's dismissal, the Foreign Office said: \"The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.\" Following his sacking, Mandelson said being the UK's ambassador to the US had been \"the privilege of my life\". It comes as Sir Keir faces growing pressure over his handling of Lord Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US. Labour MP Clive Lewis, an outspoken voice on the Labour left, said Sir Keir \"doesn't seem up to the job\" , adding that there was a \"very, very dangerous atmosphere\" among Labour MPs. Another Labour MP Jo White said the \"clock is ticking\" for Sir Keir to turn polls around before local elections next May. Labour MP Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs committee, has written to the new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper asking for details on the vetting process for Lord Mandelson's appointment, and whether security concerns were dismissed. Thornberry's letter was first reported by Sky News. It also emerged that Jeffrey Epstein paid for Lord Mandelson's travel on two separate occasions in 2003 totalling more than $7,400 (£5,400), according to documents released by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee. Earlier this week, US lawmakers released an alleged \"birthday book\" containing messages sent to Jeffrey Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003 - including one from Lord Mandelson . In his letter, which features photos of the pair, Lord Mandelson described Jeffrey Epstein as his \"best pal\", and an \"intelligent, sharp-witted man\".

A further £142 million in UK aid will support Ukraine's energy infrastructure and vulnerable communities, while 100 new sanctions will aim to further hit Russia's economy and military supplies. Cooper was met by Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha at a railway station in Kyiv on Friday morning, and later met President Volodymyr Zelensky. Her visit, which the Foreign Office says reaffirms the UK's support for Ukraine, comes days after Russian drones violating Polish airspace were shot down by Poland and Nato. The Foreign Office said there had been \"a summer of Russian delay tactics at peace talks\" aimed at ending the conflict in the region, as well as increased attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Cooper added support for Kyiv was \"unwavering and stronger than ever\" and that fresh funding would support Ukraine through the winter and into 2026. She continued: \"Putin's bombardment of Ukrainian civilians, his stalling and delaying in internationally-backed peace talks, and his blatant disregard for human life must end.\" Of the funding boost, £100 million will be used to help civilians in frontline communities, including to repair critical water and heating systems, support livelihoods and strengthen resilience over the winter. The remaining £42 million will go towards carrying out vital repairs to Ukraine's electricity network and putting in place critical protection for gas and power infrastructure. Cooper will visit Kyiv's cabinet of ministers government building, which was hit for the first time on Sunday when Russia carried out its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the war began. She will also visit a residential building destroyed by a Russian strike. Separately, Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday after an invitation by an organisation that supports Ukrainians with life-changing injuries caused by the war. The Duke of Sussex, who arrived by train on Friday morning, said he wanted to do \"everything possible\" to help the recovery of injured military personnel. Reuters Prince Harry poses for a picture with wounded Ukrainian serviceman Vasyl, 38 As well as hitting economic and military targets, the Foreign Office said fresh sanctions on Russia will also hit 70 more ships involved in Putin's \"shadow fleet\" operation, responsible for illicitly carrying cargo including oil exports since the war began. Among the companies sanctioned are firms which supply Russia with equipment such as electronics, chemicals and explosives used to manufacture missiles and other weapons. Cooper said the measures \"form the next stage in the UK's leading efforts to ramp up economic pressure, alongside our security support and our work alongside the coalition of the willing for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine\". Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Theresa May is among the peers who are vehemently opposed to the legislation, arguing that it there were not enough safeguards to prevent people being pressured into ending their lives. The former Conservative PM spoke as the House of Lords began its scrutiny of the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which was passed by MPs with a majority of 23 in June. Responding outside the chamber, Leadbeater said terminally ill people supporting the Bill were \"definitely not suicidal\" but \"they are dying, and they have no choice about that\". Outside Parliament, demonstrators for and against the plans made their views known as the Bill progresses towards potentially coming into force in England and Wales. Inside, the red benches in the Lords were packed with a record number of requests to speak as two days of consideration began, with Leadbeater, who introduced the Bill to the Commons, watching from the gallery. Baroness May spoke in opposition, warning of the risk of medical cover-ups, and saying she had a friend who calls it the \"license to kill Bill\" as a result. She said in her view the legislation would be \"an assisted suicide Bill\", adding: \"Suicide is wrong, but this Bill, effectively, says suicide is okay. What message does that give to our society?\" The Bill did not have good enough safeguards to prevent people from being pressurised to end their lives, she said, and she also worried about knock-on effects around normalising deaths by suicide for people who feel their life is \"less worth living than others\". \"I worry about the impact it will have on people with disabilities, with chronic illness, with mental health problems, because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others,\" she said. Leadbeater praised Baroness May's \"very powerful contribution\" to the debate but said she found \"the framing around suicide very uncomfortable\". \"The terminally ill people I've met are definitely not suicidal,\" she told PA Media. \"They definitely don't want to die, but they are dying, and they have no choice about that.\" The MP for Spen Valley dismissed talk of potential medical cover-ups, saying the legislation aimed to put a \"very robust\" law in place to create \"a framework around the assisted death rather than the lack of framework that there is at the moment\". With peers speaking against the Bill outnumbering those in favour by about two-to-one on the first day of two days of debate, Leadbeater said she was still confident the Bill would ultimately be allowed by the Lords. \"I do remain confident that the will of the public will be respected, as will the will of the elected chamber,\" she said, referring to the House of Commons. During the debate, peers made emotional pleas on both sides of the assisted dying debate, many sharing personal tales of loss underpinning their stance. The former justice secretary Lord Charlie Falconer, who is the sponsor of the Bill in the Lords, branded the current legal situation \"confused\", causing \"terrible suffering\" and lacking \"compassion and safeguards\". Lord Falconer reassured peers there would be \"more than enough time\" for scrutiny before the current Parliamentary session ended next spring and that he was \"very open\" to suggestions for how the Bill could be \"further strengthened and improved\". However, he reminded his colleagues the Bill had already been passed by MPs and the House of Lords should \"respect the primacy of the Commons\", instead of trying to block the plans. \"We must do our job in this House, and our job is not to frustrate, it is to scrutinise,\" he said. As debate began, Conservative peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean told colleagues he had changed his mind on the issue after his father, who \"died in agony\" from cancer, said his son was to blame for not allowing him to end his suffering. \"I was completely poleaxed by that,\" he said, adding his father told him: \"you have consistently voted to prevent me getting what I want, which is having the opportunity to decide how and when I come to die\". \"As a Christian I have thought about that long and hard, and come to the conclusion that my father was right,\" he added. House of Cards trilogy author Lord Michael Dobbs described the current legal framework as \"cruel and untenable\" and insisted those who were opposed for religious reasons had \"no right to impose your view on others\". He said: \"I wish I'd had the opportunity out of love to help my mother pass peacefully in my arms, instead of watching her years of suffering. \"It would have been her choice, but she had no choice, and instead I'm left with an enduring memory of endless pain.\" Speaking in support, Baroness Margaret Hodge said \"denying choice represents a fundamental attack on the freedom and right of individuals to control their life at that terrible time when they're dying\". She said: \"In my view, we're presented with a straightforward choice: are we prepared to allow people in this country faced with certain and imminent death to choose how they die? \"I want that choice for myself, I would have wanted that choice for those close to me whom I have seen die in terrible agony.\" Speaking against, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said certain aspects of the assisted dying Bill \"blur the line\" for doctors around euthanasia. Lady Grey-Thompson, a Paralympian and long-time campaigner on the rights of disabled people, said: \"Clause 25, sub-clause eight, allows the co-ordinating doctor to assist the person to ingest or otherwise self-administer the substance. This blurs the line between assisted dying and euthanasia.\" Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally has warned that the \"choice\" to die \"is an illusion\" without \"fully-funded palliative and social care services\". Dame Sarah told the Lords: \"Above all, this Bill fails in its central plank, that it delivers choice. \"A meaningful choice would see the measures in this Bill set alongside equally available, fully-funded palliative and social care services. \"Without the choice offered, this choice is an illusion.\" The House of Lords will continue its scrutiny of the Bill on Friday, 19 September.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy saw zero growth in the month, which was in line with expectations, following a 0.4% expansion in June. However, monthly figures are volatile, and the ONS has said it will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period. In the three months to July, the economy expanded by 0.2% The government is under mounting pressure to deliver on its key priority of boosting economic growth ahead of the Budget on 26 November. In the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans with increasing speculation she will raise taxes to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. The ONS said the service sector grew by 0.4% over the three months to July, helped by a good performance from the health sector, computer programming and office support services. However, this was offset by a fall in output from the production sector, which includes manufacturing. In July itself, manufacturing contracted by 1.3% - the sharpest monthly decline since July last year. The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, and then grew by 0.3% between April and June. The ONS said the latest figures showed the economy had \"continued to slow\" over the past three months. However, it is still on track to grow in the third quarter. What is GDP? When is the Budget and what might be in it? Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the UK's finances were \"looking pretty resilient to the barrage of shocks faced this year\". The latest data also comes ahead of the Bank of England's next interest rate decision on 18 September, with policymakers weighing up flagging growth against stubborn inflation. 'Sign of things to come' Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in the Budget if she wants to meet her self-imposed rules on the economy. These are: day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30 to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30 Estimates for the size of the \"black hole\" in the public finances that Reeves needs to fill in order to meet her rules vary widely, between £18bn and £50bn, but the chancellor has rejected the latter forecast . Since Labour pledged in its manifesto last year not to raise taxes on \"working people\" - namely income tax, National Insurance and VAT - speculation is growing around what changes she might make. Companies have long spoken of the financial hit they have taken from a rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage that came into force in April. And some have warned that tax rises for business could hamper growth further, with some saying they are holding off on hiring or investing until the details of the Budget become clear. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the \"weak start to the third quarter [is] a sign of things to come\". \"Economic activity is expected to slow in the second half of the year as the temporary factors which pushed up growth in the first half of 2025 begin to fade,\" she said. \"Additionally, the later date of the Autumn Budget could prolong some uncertainties for businesses, delaying investment decisions and acting as a drag on growth until more clarity emerges.\" Responding to the latest growth figures, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We know there's more to do to boost growth because whilst our economy isn't broken, it does feel stuck. \"That's the result of years of underinvestment, which we're determined to reverse through our plan for change. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Any economic growth is welcome - but this government is distracted from the problems the country is facing. \"While the government lurch from one scandal to another, borrowing costs recently hit a 27-year high - a damning vote of no confidence in Labour that makes painful tax rises all but certain.\" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The government talks of going full throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. \"Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our High Streets and ministers' refusal to jettison their short-sighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.\" Personal finance GDP UK economy Related When is the Budget and what might be in it?

Left-wing backbencher Bell Riberio-Addy said she had not secured the 80 MP nominations needed by 17:00 BST on Thursday to progress. Phillipson, meanwhile, has secured 175 votes, while Powell has 117. In the next stage, the contenders have to win the backing of 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, such as a trade union, to go through to a ballot of members. 'Being deputy Labour leader is a ghastly job' Rayner's replacement will show which way political wind is blowing in Labour \"I want to unite our party and our movement, deliver the change our country needs and beat Reform,\" Phillipson said in a video posted on social media following Thursday evening's deadline. \"Now is the time to come together so we can unite to win again.\" Powell, meanwhile, has vowed to act as a \"bridge for all parts\" of the party. \"At a time when there are forces trying to spread division and hatred, Labour must be the voice of unity and hope,\" she said in a statement. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner, after she failed to pay enough tax on her £800,000 flat in Hove . The winner of the contest will not become deputy prime minister, as Rayner was, because that position has been handed to Justice Secretary David Lammy. Posting on social media after nominations closed on Thursday, Ribeiro-Addy said: \"Unfortunately, I have not secured the high number of nominations required to proceed in the deputy leadership contest. \"I am disappointed that the full range of Labour members' views will not be represented on the ballot paper.\" The position of deputy leader is a potentially powerful one, as a link between the Labour membership and the party leadership - and whoever wins will be at the forefront of Labour election campaigns. Crucially, they cannot be sacked by the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, as they will have their own mandate. Voting for the next deputy leader is likely to open for Labour members on 8 October and close on 23 October, with the winner being announced two days later. The remaining candidates will have an opportunity to woo Labour members at hustings during the party's conference in Liverpool at the end of September. The contest opens up chances for unhappy MPs and party members to express their discontent with the leadership, potentially overshadowing the big ministerial speeches. Phillipson - the only cabinet member left in the race - emerged as the early frontrunner after attracting support from MPs who are loyal to the government. But party members may prefer a candidate who is prepared to challenge Sir Keir, potentially harming Phillipson's chances. Powell - who was recently sacked from her cabinet role in a ministerial reshuffle - may attract the support of Labour MPs dissatisfied with the performance of Sir Keir's government and its policies. Many senior Labour figures have said the next leader should be a woman and from outside London to counter what they see as the London-centric and male-dominated party leadership.

Micheál Martin described the meeting, which took place on Friday at Chequers, as \"warm and constructive\". The Irish government, along with all of Northern Ireland's political parties and victims' groups, oppose the existing UK Legacy Act. In December, the Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn formally started the process to repeal the act. \"Very good progress has been made on legacy and the prime minister and I agreed that we are close to setting out a framework to address legacy issues, recognising its importance to victims and survivors, and to the wider community in Northern Ireland and across these islands,\" Martin told reporters following the meeting. When asked if the updated framework would be completed in a matter of weeks, he said: \"I am not going to put a time down on it but it'll be shortly.\" The Legacy Act was passed by the previous Conservative government in September 2023 despite widespread opposition to it. It created a new legacy body, the the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR), to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The act shut down all historical inquests. The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families. 'Need for a ceasefire' The situation in Gaza and the war between Russia and Ukraine were also mentioned at the meeting. \"We discussed the catastrophic situation in Gaza - the need for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and a massive surge in humanitarian aid,\" Martin said. \"We also committed to continue working together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.\" Their meeting comes after the tánaiste (Irish deputy minister) previously told a crowd in Oxford that the new agreement on dealing with legacy cases was \"effectively there\".

The former environment secretary inherited the housing brief from Angela Rayner in last week's reshuffle, after she resigned over her tax affairs . Reed told the BBC the only way out of what he called a housing \"crisis\" was to \"build baby build\" and threatened sanctions on developers who dragged their feet, although he did not specify what that might entail. Industry leaders have warned the government faces a \"huge challenge\" to reach its target, with housebuilders facing \"mounting pressures\". The Conservatives said the government's housing pledges \"are for the birds\". \"Everyone knows Labour can't deliver on their housing promises,\" shadow housing secretary James Cleverly said. \"New housing relies on backing builders. But from day one this government has been anti-business and anti-growth.\" The promise to build 1.5 million new homes over the next Parliament - which is due to run until 2029 - was a key pledge in Labour's general election manifesto. BBC Verify's Housing Tracker recently showed the number of new homes in England fell during Labour's first year in power, continuing a fall that began under the Conservatives. However, applications to build more homes have risen over the past six months. Legislation aimed at reforming the planning system to speed up housebuilding is currently going through Parliament. UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes? Labour's plan to build 1.5m homes – can it be delivered? Pressed over whether the 1.5 million pledge was a hope or a guarantee, Reed told the BBC: \"It's what we're going to do. \"We'll do it by working in partnership with the developers and with the builders,\" he said. \"My job is to get every barrier out of the way that is stopping that construction going ahead.\" Speaking during a visit to a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, Reed said he was going to come up with an \"acceleration package\" that would get planning applications approved more quickly and \"spades in the ground\". He added: \"I don't want the developers dragging their feet. They don't want to drag their feet - it's their business. \"They make money from going ahead with construction. I'm going to work in partnership with the developers but there will be sanctions if the building doesn't go ahead at pace and at scale.\" This week the Home Builders Federation warned the sector was facing rising regulatory costs and taxes , \"compounded by delays in processing planning applications\". In Bedfordshire, Garry Dixon, who runs a construction company that works on smaller residential developments, said rising costs were a \"massive\" challenge. \"I would say three years ago you were getting bricks at 75p, 80p a brick and now they're like £1.20 a brick,\" he said. \"It's just huge, and that's just one sector of the build.\" He said the government should put more money into training and apprenticeships to ensure the sector had the skills it needed, but that was not a \"quick fix\". Steve Reed was speaking to the BBC at a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire Reed was also challenged over whether the government's pledge to stop housing asylum seekers in hotels by the end of the Parliament could increase pressure on housing. The promise has prompted concern that asylum seekers could be moved into houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) - rental homes for groups of people sharing facilities. Reed told the BBC: \"We're looking at a number of options. We intend to do this in a way that does not put further pressure on the housing market. \"People are already struggling to find a place to live, to rent or to buy. We don't want to add to that burden so we will find a solution to that.\" The government has already said it is looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers , as well as considering using prefabricated buildings or warehouses. Reed was moved from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government after Rayner resigned over failing to pay enough tax on a flat purchase. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Reed said he was \"very close\" to Rayner and her resignation was \"very painful\". \"Angela's a friend who was going through a very, very difficult time. And you know on the one level, I wanted to reach out to her and support her as a friend and I did that,\" he said. \"But on another level, there are these events that I'm watching on the TV news at the same time. And it's quite odd when you suddenly find yourself and the things that are happening to the people around you in the news too.\" You can listen to Steve Reed's full interview on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson on BBC Sounds .

The move by Manchester Metropolitan University comes after Mandelson was sacked as UK ambassador to the USA by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday. He was dismissed after it was revealed that he sent Epstein supportive messages while the disgraced American financier was facing sex offences charges. A spokesman for the university - of which Mandelson was chancellor between 2016 and 2024 - said his honorary awards have been rescinded \"following the revelations that have come to light in recent days\". He had been given honorary doctorate on his appointment as chancellor, and a commemorative medal at the end of his tenure. Mandelson's links to Epstein had been discussed by the university's board of governors during his tenure, when a photograph of the two was made public. \"At that time we were reassured that there was no ongoing connection nor anything that would compromise Lord Mandelson's position,\" the university spokesman said. He added: \"Our thoughts are with the victims who were subjected to the appalling crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and to all those who continue to be affected today. \"The University no longer has any ties with Lord Mandelson.\" Mandelson, one of the principal architects of New Labour, was appointed as ambassador to the USA in December 2024. Epstein died of suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in New York City on 10 August 2019, while awaiting trial.

Photograph: Nam Y Huh/AP US economy Analysis As US edges closer to stagflation, economists blame Trump policies Lauren Aratani Recent data shows stagflation, stagnant growth and price inflation, is possible as economy shaken by uncertainty Sat 13 Sep 2025 07.00 EDT Last modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 07.01 EDT Share It’s a strange time for the US economy . Prices are rising, jobs growth has stalled, uncertainty is everywhere and stock markets have soared to record highs. Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being uttered again: stagflation. GDP chart Stagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with “inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession. US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers Read more The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending. For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it. After Donald Trump ’s tariffs were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021. However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were revised down by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year. Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate hit 2.9%, the highest since January. Inflation chart Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing. “Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.” In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation. Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation. Trump’s crackdown on immigration has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to prices , tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers. Investors are banking on hopes the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain. In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, outlined the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer. US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported Read more “While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.” Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August. The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy. Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty. “Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.” One analysis from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue. If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger. jobs chart “If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said. The Yale Budget Lab estimated that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”. The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has claimed that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president. “The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.” Explore more on these topics US economy Trump tariffs Inflation Economics Donald Trump Trump administration US politics analysis Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.355 against the US dollar this morning. The pound against the US dollar over the last 24 hours (timings in GMT) Photograph: LSEG Kathleen Brooks , research director at XTB, points out there is “not much to like” from the July monthly GDP update, with zero growth in the economy at the start of the third quarter. If the third quarter is not going to be a disaster for the UK economy, then growth in August and September will need to do the heavy lifting. The pound is extending losses on this news and is eroding some of Thursday’s gains. For now, GBP/USD is hanging on to $1.3550, however, if bond yields start to rise on the back of this data, then we could see pound weakness later on Friday. The pound is the third worst performer in the G10 FX space so far today.

The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget. It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half. The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing. The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.” More here: UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves Read more In other news Ocado’s shares have plunged 20% after its US partner, grocery giant Kroger, signalled a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses.

The London stock market has just closed, cementing a terrible day for Ocado. Ocado’s shares have ended the day down 19.9%, at 240p, as City investors react to the news that its US partner Kroger was considering a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses. That knocks £500m off Ocado’s market value, as the company was worth just over £2.5bn at the start of the day. Chris Beauchamp , chief market analyst at IG , says: “It is hard to overstate how damaging this news is for Ocado. Kroger was one of the linchpins of its expansion strategy, and was a poster boy for the use of Ocado’s technology worldwide. Others may now follow suit. Sadly Ocado has been a losing proposition for most investors over the course of its life as a listed company, with only a brief period in 2013/14 and then from 2018-2021 really delivering the goods.

The University of Michican’s index of consumer morale has declined to 55.4 from 58.2 in August; according to Bloomberg that’s the lowest reading since May. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu reports that sentiment about the economy fell particularly strongly among lower and middle income consumers, adding: Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well; current and expected personal finances both eased about 8% this month. Trade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month. Still, sentiment remains above April and May 2025 readings, immediately after the initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs.

As flagged earlier, Ocado’s shares are under pressure after key customer Kroger , the US grocery giant, said it would undertake a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. That has raised fears of weaker demand for its robotic warehouses. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell , comments: Kroger also said it was using stores ‘very heavily’ to fulfil e-commerce orders and implied that was its key focus from now on. “These comments imply that Ocado might find it harder to sell more automated solutions to Kroger, and that existing agreements might come under review. It’s the worst kind of news imaginable for Ocado investors as they’ve bought into a company which has positioned itself as the technology solution to grocery providers’ needs. While Ocado has continued to win new contracts, the pace has been erratic. The prospect of existing relationships starting to deteriorate adds another level of risk. Then there is the big question of when Ocado will ever make a sustainable profit.” Share 3d ago 09.47 EDT There’s a quiet start to trading on Wall Street, a day after stocks hit record levels. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 126 points, or 0.27%, to 45,982 points.

Following this morning’s news that GDP was unchanged in July, NIESR estimate that UK GDP will rise by 0.4% in the July-September quarter. That would be slightly faster growth than the 0.3% recorded in the second quarter of this year. NIESR says: We expect GDP to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, as we forecast better monthly growth outturns for August and September. However, elevated uncertainty among businesses and households continue to pose downside risks to this forecast. Fergus Jimenez-England , associate economist at NIESR , warns that economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments, adding: “Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the Chancellor this Autumn.” ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker expect #UKGDP to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter 📈 ⬇️Read more here 📊⬇️ #UKeconomy #gdpgrowth https://t.co/U504vvjFVF &mdash; National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) September 12, 2025 \\n\\n\"}}\"> ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker expect #UKGDP to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter 📈 ⬇️Read more here 📊⬇️ #UKeconomy #gdpgrowth https://t.co/U504vvjFVF — National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) September 12, 2025 Share 3d ago 07.54 EDT Ocado shares fall 12% on Kroger worries Back in the financial markets, shares in Ocado have slumped by 12% on fears that one of its key customers could be pulling back from automation. Online grocery firm Ocado is the top faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after US supermarket chain Kroger said it plans to conduct a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. This suggests Ocado might struggle to sell more automated solutions to Kroger , who has been an important customer in the past. Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets , explains: Last night on its earnings call, the US retailer, which is Ocado’s biggest partner for its warehouse automation technology, said it would take a “hard look” at some of its automated facilities and carry out a “full site-by-site analysis” of its existing network. The comments are clearly a negative for Ocado as Kroger seems likely to move away from the kind of large CFCs provided by the British company and instead seems to be looking to lean on local stores to fill orders. Back in 2018, Ocado’s shares soared after it announced a deal to provide its technology to Kroger – a breakthrough in its push to licence its services to grocers around the world.

He argued: “We need to curb expenditure at the government level. We need to find a way to curb wage inflation.” Barclays boss urges UK ministers to limit public sector pay rises Read more TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has said in responcse that “the prize for the most tone-deaf comment of the year goes to C. S. Venkatakrishnan”, adding: “This banking boss has some brass neck.

The Bank of Russia has decided to cut its key lending rate by 100 basis points to 17.00%, down from 18%. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a cut of 200 basis points. Announcing the decision, the Bank points out that inflation is still running above its 4% target: Underlying measures of current price growth have not changed significantly and generally remain above 4% in annualised terms. The economy continues to return to a balanced growth path. Lending growth has accelerated in recent months. Inflation expectations remain high.

It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half. The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing. CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Read more The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.” a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile. The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further. “Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.” The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London. Business groups have blamed Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution , which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business. Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade. “The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence. Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. “Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.” Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed. The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which jumped to 3.8% in July , prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months. The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday. Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/Reuters Economic growth (GDP) Analysis Stagnant GDP shows scale of challenge for Rachel Reeves at autumn budget Richard Partington Senior economics correspondent Chancellor calls economy ‘stuck, not broken’ but there are signs her policies have added to the UK’s economic headwinds Business live – latest updates UK economy flatlines in July Business rates rise putst big shops at risk, say retailers Fri 12 Sep 2025 04.54 EDT Last modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 05.05 EDT Share “Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from Rachel Reeves . Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job. The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. Growth flatlined in July , slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer. Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year. Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July. CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Read more Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers. Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025 women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services. The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds. Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment. As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances. Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging.

Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power. On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the International Monetary Fund – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges. Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.

This latest sign of a weakening jobs market has pushed shares higher on Wall Street, as investors anticipate cuts to US interest rates. That’s despite US inflation rising in August, with the consumer prices up by 2.9% over the last year , up from 2.7% in July. Rising food and housing costs were a factor, while economists warned that companies were passing on the cost of tariffs to consumers.

In the UK, the owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges. John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology. As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.

Rather than worrying about the state of the labor market, traders seem to be betting that the US Federal Reserve is on track to cut interest rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 218 points, or 0.5%, in early trading to 45,708 points. The broader S&P 500 index is 0.25% higher. Analysts at ING agree that the Fed’s focus is now the jobs market. James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist, explains: Inflation was a touch higher than expected and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated over coming months, but the the weakening of the jobs market is now the Fed’s priority, with rising jobless claims hinting at a pick-up in lay-offs at a time when hiring is subdued Share 4d ago 09.27 EDT Curiously, much of the increase in US jobless claims last week was recorded in Texas. The number of initial claims (a proxy for layoffs) in Texas almost doubled in the week to 6 September, to 31,908 from 16,604 in the previous seven days. There was also an increase of 2,980 in Michigan, but many other states recorded a drop in claims (before seasonal adjustments). Bloomberg economist Eliza Winger says: The surge in initial jobless claims in the first week of September came primarily from Texas, while claims declined in most states. While any deterioration in the labor market bears watching given growing labor-market weakness, a broader increase in claims would have been much more concerning.” Share 4d ago 09.18 EDT Experts: Fed likely to cut rates to help weak jobs market The jump in US jobless claims last week, and the pick-up in inflation in August, are a worrying sign for America’s economy. Together, they paint a picture of an economy losing jobs, as consumers are hit by rising prices in the shops, as tariffs are passed onto consumers. Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank, explains: “The August CPI inflation report was a hot one, no matter how you slice or dice it. President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now. “Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6 th September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021. This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.” Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying: While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years. This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view. Share 4d ago 09.10 EDT New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high Ouch! The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has hit its highest level in almost four years. The number of ‘initial claims’ for unemployment benefits jumped by 27,000 last week to 263,000, the highest level for initial claims since October 23, 2021. That will reinforce concerns that the US labor market has weakened, following recent weak non-farm payroll reports, and Tuesday’s news that the US added 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated for the year to March . Aaron Hill , chief market analyst at FP Markets, says the jobs slowdown will fan speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, adding:​ The central bank faces mounting pressure, but its room to manoeuvre is razor-thin. Share 4d ago 08.54 EDT Companies 'passing rising costs from tariffs onto consumers' US inflation “continued its march higher” in August, reports Katy Stoves , investment manager at Mattioli Woods . Stoves says US companies are now passing the cost of tariffs onto customers: With buffer inventories that had been built ahead of tariffs being depleted, businesses are now forced to replenish stock at elevated prices. With the tariffs looking to be more permanent, companies now have cover to pass these rising costs onto consumers, rather than compressing margins. Whilst some had anticipated tariffs would create a one-off price adjustment, the data increasingly suggests this may be a more prolonged process with peak effects still to come. Share 4d ago 08.52 EDT The prices of all six major American grocery store food groups rose in August, today’s US inflation report shows. The index for fruits and vegetables rose 1.6% over the month, as tomato prices jumped by 4.5% and apple prices increased by 3.5%. The meats, poultry, fish and eggs index increased by 1.0% in August with the beef index up by 2.7%. On an annual basis, meats, poultry, fish, and eggs were 5.6% more expensive than a year ago. The index for nonalcoholic beverages increased by 0.6% during August and the index for other food at home increased 0.1%. Dairy and related products index and cereals and bakery products both rose by 0.1%. Share 4d ago 08.43 EDT Tariffs 'clearly hitting' as US inflation rises On a monthly basis, the US inflation report shows prices rose by 0.4% in August alone. That’s twice as fast as the 0.2% rise in prices recorded in July. The BLS reports that housing (shelter) and food were key drivers: The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase.

Share Updated at 08.03 EDT 4d ago 07.49 EDT Turkey cuts interest rates by more than expected Over in Istanbul, Turkey’s central bank has announced a large cut to interest rates, but borrowing costs still remain high. Turkey’s central bank has lowered its policy interest rate by 250 basis points to 40.5%, a slightly bigger cut than expected. It eased policy after inflation slowed to 32.95% in August 2025 from 33.52% in July. The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye explained: The underlying trend of inflation slowed down in August. While GDP growth was above projections in the second quarter, final domestic demand remained weak. Recent data indicate that demand conditions are at disinflationary levels. Food prices and service items with high inertia are exerting upward pressure on inflation. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, and global developments continue to pose risks to the disinflation process. The tight monetary policy stance, which will be maintained until price stability is achieved, will strengthen the disinflation process through demand, exchange rate, and expectation channels.

Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images US economy US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers New CPI update shows prices increased 2.9% over the last year, but Wall Street optimistic Fed will cut interest rates Lauren Aratani in New York Thu 11 Sep 2025 08.42 EDT Last modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 11.41 EDT Share Inflation rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of tariffs on to consumers. The newest update to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July. Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the US jobs market is weakening . Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%. US stocks shot up on Wednesday after the producer price index, which tracks wholesale prices, showed a slight dip in August after a steep rise in July, making investors hopeful that inflation – while still rising – is going up at a slow pace. latest inflation chart The Fed has refrained from cutting rates over the past year, citing instability in the economy introduced by federal immigration and trade policies. The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market. At his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, Jerome Powell , said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates. Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”. “If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said. Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection. Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy went into the negative for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021. The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.

He added that Primark had not raised clothing prices in a year as it had been able to offset higher labour costs with more technology, such as self-service tills and lower freight and cotton prices. Weston said given the higher food prices, Primark’s shoppers had kept a tighter rein on spending than more affluent consumers. “We had to work very hard to earn our shoppers’ money, as we are not in an easy consumer environment,” he said, with sales in the UK and Ireland rising by 1% over the six months to 13 September, helped by new store openings. But shares in ABF slid more than 13% on Wednesday as analysts said trading at Primark’s mainland Europe outlets had been worse than hoped. The company also warned that sugar profits would be below expectations. ABF’s sugar business, which includes the closing Vivergo ethanol plant , is also likely to make a £40m loss, much deeper than feared. The company said group sales are expected to have fallen by 2% at established Primark stores in the six months to 13 September, with sales flat at established UK stores and sales falls in Germany, France and Italy. Weston blamed “political turmoil” in France, which was the worst performing country, and consumer uncertainty elsewhere in Europe amid the Ukraine war and inflation. Weston said Primark was “trading very strongly” as a seasonal change in the weather had led to demand for warmer clothing and it had sharpened up its fashion ranges, particularly on denim. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many retailers fear Reeves will impose further tax increases on businesses in her 26 November budget. Weston said: “I hope consumer sentiment doesn’t take another great whack in November … anything that reduces returns on investment or increases the costs of employing people [could affect sentiment]”. Weston said he would like to see Reeves’ November budget “closing that big loophole around de minimis” – a tax break that allows Shein and others to import items worth less than £135 direct to consumers without paying customs duty. “I don’t like to be faced with competition that has an unfair advantage which could be costing the Treasury maybe £100m a year,” he said. “A lot of money is being left on the table unnecessarily.” He also called on the chancellor to revise plans to increase business rates for large high street stores.

Pensions minister Torsten Bell and Starmer’s new chief economic adviser, Minouche Shafik , will co-chair the “budget board”, that will meet weekly to discuss the details of the statement. Government sources said the meetings were aimed at ensuring No 10 and No 11 were aligned and that there was not a repeat of the backlash from businesses that followed Rachel Reeves’s maiden budget. Starmer has looked to increase his grip on economic policy in recent weeks, by appointing Shafiq, poaching Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones, and appointing a longtime Treasury civil servant to be his principal private secretary. Reeves and her team were blamed for a series of political missteps last year, including slashing the winter fuel allowance, while business lobby groups have blamed her £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) for raising the cost of hiring and forcing them to push up prices. With the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) widely expected to downgrade its forecasts, the chancellor is expected to have to find significant tax increases in November, to avoid busting her fiscal rules in five years’ time. Bell, the former director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, has previously suggested a series of radical tax policies, including on inheritance tax, pensions and national insurance. But government officials confirmed the panel would also include Reeves’s chief of staff, Katie Martin, who recently took on the job of liaising with businesses on Reeves’s behalf, and Varun Chandra, who canvasses firms for No 10. The trio are expected to bring a business perspective to the discussions, which is likely to inject a note of caution around more radical policies. Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was seen by some in government as one of the driving forces behind the botched welfare reforms at the spring statement, will also attend. The prime minister’s new chief secretary, Darren Jones – previously a Treasury minister – and the communications directors from both No 10 and No 11, will sit on the board, too, officials confirmed. Also on the board will be Starmer’s new communications chief, Tim Allan , a veteran of Tony Blair’s time in government, with the former prime minister once describing him as “even more right wing than me”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Vistry Group Housebuilder Vistry’s profits more than halve amid economic uncertainty Fall to £40.9m in first six months of year pushes share price down, with order book lower than year ago Mark Sweney and Julia Kollewe Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.27 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 07.45 EDT Share Half-year profits at Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, have more than halved as buyer demand comes under pressure from concerns over the economy, affordability struggles and slower-than-hoped interest rate cuts . The company, which owns Bovis Homes, Countryside and Linden Homes, said its pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell by 55% to £40.9m. The slump in profits, which on an adjusted basis fell by a third to £80.6m, pushed the housebuilder’s share price down as much as 8% in early trading, before recovering to 4% down on Wednesday. Vistry completed 6,889 homes, down by 12% from the 7,792 completed a year earlier. Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn. “While we reported some positive momentum in the first quarter, market conditions softened somewhat in the second quarter, reflecting increased macro concerns and ongoing affordability challenges, particularly for first-time buyers, with expected interest rate cuts being pushed further out,” the builder said. Vistry said its forward order book was lower than a year ago, standing at £4.3bn against £5.1bn this time last year. It added that it was looking to boost flagging demand with sales and marketing initiatives. It is offering private buyers discounts of up to 5% on the sale price. “We are looking to drive an improvement in our open market sales rate in the second half through our sales and marketing initiatives albeit we remain mindful that demand will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties,” it said. Prices rose by 3% for private open market sales in the first half to £389,000 on average but it said sales rates were flat. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% in August but economists are expecting further reductions to come at a far slower pace amid stubbornly high inflation. However, Vistry was upbeat, saying it remained on track to meet full-year expectations. The company formed a long-term joint venture with the UK’s housing agency , Homes England, earlier this week. The new vehicle, Hestia, is backed by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government pledged to build 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vistry has shifted towards building social and affordable homes for its partners; it pre-sells at least 50% of new homes on its developments to housing associations, local authorities and private rented sector providers. Anthony Codling, a housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: “[Private rented sector] investors continue to drive a hard bargain, leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding; so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way. “We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders.” Explore more on these topics Vistry Group Construction industry Housing market Real estate Interest rates Economics news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Seven UK housebuilders to pay £100m to fund affordable homes after CMA investigation 9 Jul 2025 UK construction activity contracts for fourth straight month as costs rise 7 May 2025 UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEO 1 Apr 2025 In the rush to build houses, let’s remember what communities need 17 Mar 2025 Housebuilder Vistry pins hopes on £2bn affordable homes promise as profits fall 26 Mar 2025 Recruitment report reveals rise in UK demand for construction workers 17 Mar 2025 UK housebuilder Vistry’s shares plunge as it issues third profit warning 24 Dec 2024 From backwater to hotspot: how HS2 could bring £10bn economic boost to Old Oak Common 2 Mar 2025 Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Confederation of British Industry (CBI) CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Rain Newton-Smith tells chancellor ‘the time for tinkering is over’ and revisit promise not to raise taxes on working people CBI chief: ‘It’s time for Reeves to reconsider Labour’s manifesto promises on tax’ Heather Stewart and Richard Partington Tue 9 Sep 2025 12.04 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.17 EDT Share The boss of the Confederation of British Industry has suggested the chancellor should tear up Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, in a significant intervention before the budget. Rachel Reeves is widely expected to present a package of tax rises in her 26 November statement to offset deteriorating economic forecasts. However, the chancellor has been hamstrung by Labour’s promise not to increase the three main revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. In a surprise move in the debate about how to raise extra revenue, the CBI’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, says the “time for tinkering is over”. Writing in the Guardian, the head of the longstanding lobby group representing many of the UK’s largest companies warns the chancellor against “slavish adherence” to tax promises made in the run-up to last year’s general election. She said the pre-election promises have now been overtaken by events. “The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,” she writes. “The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago.” The party’s manifesto states : “Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.” As well as suggesting Reeves revisit Labour’s promises on personal taxation, Newton-Smith calls for the reform of business rates, VAT thresholds for small firms and stamp duty. Reeves used her maiden budget last October to announce a £40bn package of tax increases , including a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions that was widely criticised by businesses and has been blamed for helping fuel inflation. The chancellor subsequently promised not to return with further tax rises, saying “there’s no need to come back with another budget like this” and “we’ll never need to do that again.” However, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts, after a review of its optimistic-looking expectations for productivity. This shift, coming after costly U-turns on welfare reform and the winter fuel allowance, could leave the Treasury looking for £20bn-£30bn in revenue in five years’ time to put Reeves on course to meet her fiscal rules. Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, agreed with Newton Smith that finding £20bn or more within the constraints of the manifesto would be problematic. “Raising that amount without touching taxes that account for three-quarters of the UK’s tax base risks distorting behaviour, loading excessive pain on to small groups, and harming economic growth,” she said. “Manifesto pledges are important, but there’s a point at which they cause more harm than they’re worth.” Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her determination to stick to the pledges in recent weeks, however, as speculation has mounted about potential tax rises. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are protecting payslips for working people by keeping our promise not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.” As well as calling for tax changes, Newton-Smith also reiterates the CBI’s concerns about the government’s employment rights legislation, which she argues is deterring firms from hiring. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill includes immediate protection from unfair dismissal, after a yet-to-be determined probationary period, the right to regular hours, and the right for unions to access workplaces. Union leaders gathering in Brighton for the TUC conference on Tuesday said Labour had sought to issue reassurances that the party was still committed to the landmark bill. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who is standing in the contest to succeed Rayner as deputy Labour leader, told delegates on Tuesday: “One year ago we were elected to deliver this employment rights bill, and congress that is what we will do. We will not accept any watering down by the Lords. Forward with the employment rights bill in full. No ifs, no buts.” One union leader said ministers risked blowing up relations with the labour movement at a difficult moment for the government, and would need to retain its workers’ rights plan to show a key point of difference with Nigel Farage’s Reform. “They are not going to want to go to party conference fighting with us,” the leader argued. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said the government reshuffle had created “anxiety” at the Brighton conference, but that he believed Labour would push ahead with a policy that sought to bridge business and union demands. “We need to take business with us on this journey, the re-regulation of the labour market is necessary and not up for debate, but, you know, we know what it’s like to have been on the wrong end of getting things done to us for 14 years.” Keir Starmer carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle in the wake of Rayner’s departure, partly aimed at bolstering the government’s growth agenda. At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the prime minister told colleagues they should be ready to “move from fixing the foundations to driving forward the growth and national renewal that delivers for working people”, according to a readout from his official spokesperson.

Photograph: WPA/Getty Images Budget 2025 It’s time for Rachel Reeves to reconsider Labour’s manifesto promises on tax Rain Newton-Smith The budget must reform structures such as business rates, the VAT threshhold and stamp duty that are holding back growth CBI boss calls for Labour to tear up its manifesto prmoises Tue 9 Sep 2025 11.58 EDT Last modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 21.30 EDT Share T his government came to power after years of instability, pitching competence and commitment to the long term and without doubt, business wants them to succeed. So for the reshuffle to be more than political theatre, it needs to regalvanise the growth mission. That means making it easier for business to invest, create jobs and drive higher living standards. Leadership calls not only for promises, but vision and delivery. There are no easy choices, either on policy or personnel. And as we look ahead to the chancellor’s budget in November, she must recognise that that we must avoid short-term solutions that risk us getting stuck in a cycle between fiscal events. The government must grasp the nettle and find the right solutions to the big challenges on tax and regulation. This decisive action can then be matched by business investment to get our economy back on the rise and deliver improved living standards for people in every region. The prime minister said we cannot tax our way to growth and that is certainly true. Businesses already pay more tax than ever before. The £308bn paid last year more than covers the budgets of the NHS, schools and defence combined. Businesses are also picking up a greater proportion of the tax bill: paying 30% of all tax in 2023-24, the highest proportion since 1998, rising to 32% from this year as they pay an extra £24bn in NICs. Alongside this burden, business regulation is growing. The employment rights bill in its current form will add cost and complexity, is already leading some firms to put hiring plans on ice, and risks making it even harder to bring people back into work. There is still a chance to achieve the bill’s aims without frustrating those shared goals, but government must seize it now. Sectors critical for job creation in local communities often have low margins and high fixed costs so feel cumulative tax rises and the burden of unwieldy regulation more sharply. And most of the taxes they pay – including VAT, business rates and NICs – are due whether they make a profit or not. A further tax rise for enterprise would not only be unwise but would run contrary to the promises of autumn 2024, when businesses last stomached a tax hit. Further rises would leave us with a growth plan in name only. Profit is not a dirty word – it’s the reward for taking risks, it funds investment, creates jobs, and powers pay rises. Businesses that cannot sustain themselves also cannot sustain the jobs that rely on them – let alone invest and grow. The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions. The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago. The chancellor must commit to tax reform, not just tax rises. It is the structure of the system, not just the rates, that holds back growth: business rates penalise investment; the VAT threshold discourages scaling; and stamp duty restricts labour mobility. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How do we help small businesses burst through the VAT ceiling? Can we fix tax thresholds and childcare so it always pays to work harder? How do we ensure tax doesn’t stop people moving? Could road pricing fill the yawning gap government faces as fuel duties decline? Many plausible answers have been in the “good idea but too difficult” box for too long. Now is the time to fix things we know have long been broken. (You can add not backing away from driving efficiency in public services to that list of hard but necessary reforms too.) While it’s imperative to understand the challenges we face, that does not equate to talking down our economy. There are deep roots of greatness and potential in the UK: our universities are world-beating, our life sciences sector is a global leader, and our financial services are a powerhouse industry. We have everything we need to steal a march on our competitors, but only if we act fast and decisively now. The time for tinkering is over. We need to see commitment to the vision, reform and delivery, delivery, delivery of the government’s chief economic aim, growth. That means along with changes of personnel, changing outdated tax policies that risk hobbling our national ambition. The writer is the chief executive of the CBI business lobby group.

Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters US unemployment and employment data US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported Revision highlights recent concerns about the health of the labor market, and follows a lackluster August jobs report Michael Sainato Tue 9 Sep 2025 11.09 EDT Last modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 18.30 EDT Share The US added 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated for the year to March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced on Tuesday, highlighting recent concerns about the health of the labor market. The revisions are 50% higher than last year’s adjustment and were on the higher end of Wall Street estimates between 600,000 and 1 million. The revision comes after a lackluster August jobs report , with only 22,000 jobs added in the US. That report too contained revisions and noted that 13,000 jobs were lost for the month of June 2025, the first negative jobs report survey since December 2020. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, the highest rate since 2021. Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, after a weak July job’s report that he claimed – without evidence – was “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. But while these revisions to the jobs data are large, they are not unusual. During periods of economic change – such as the introduction of tariffs and the arrival of AI in the workplace – economists note businesses often take longer to reply to the BLS’s surveys, leading to gaps in their data. US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing slowdown amid Trump tariffs Read more “Annual revisions incorporate slow, administrative (non-survey) data that helps keep monthly estimates representative of broad labor-market trends,” stated Friends of Bureau of Labor Statistics in an FAQ on job statistics from the bureau . The largest revisions were in leisure and hospitality (down 176,000), professional and business services (down 158,000) and retail trade (down 126,200). Government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000 jobs. The numbers released will face further revisions when BLS releases final benchmark figure in February 2026. “These numbers are likely to anger President Trump and the White House who incorrectly view revised data as political manipulation,” wrote Elise Gould and Ben Zipperer, economists at the Economic Policy Institute, in a post on the report. “Trump has already lashed out at BLS, including firing the agency’s commissioner because a jobs report showed a rapidly weakening labor market. But these BLS data revisions are not corrections of mistakes. Revisions are part of the regular, transparent process to update employment counts with the most comprehensive data possible.” Explore more on these topics US unemployment and employment data US economy Economics Donald Trump news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Retail industry UK retail sales rise but stores fear tax worries could hit festive period Warm weather and interest rate cut lift sales in August, as food, drink and computers perform strongly Mark Sweney Tue 9 Sep 2025 01.00 EDT Last modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 02.38 EDT Share Record warm weather and a Bank of England interest rate cut lifted retail sales in August, according to the latest survey, but retailers fear that speculation about tax rises could weigh on consumers in the crucial pre-Christmas trading period. Retail sales increased 3.1% year on year as consumer spending on food and drink rose, and sales of computers and related equipment performed well as parents readied children for the new school year. However, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which publishes the monthly figures in conjunction with KPMG, said the 4.7% boost in spending on food and drink was due to price rises as opposed to consumers buying more products. The report said food inflation was driven by rising prices across staples including beef, chocolate and coffee. And while computing – and gaming – continued to show strong sales, parents facing an expensive start to the new school year cut back on buying uniforms. The BRC said businesses were concerned about sales in the golden quarter, the crucial three-month period in the run-up to Christmas that many retailers rely on for the bulk of their revenues. “Sunny weather and an interest rate cut helped August round off a solid summer of sales,” said the chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Despite a better summer, retailers approach the golden quarter with caution. “With the later-than-expected budget falling just days before Black Friday [discount sales], many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas.” Last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the budget would be held on 26 November , later than many had expected. Last month’s sales increase followed a rise of 2.5% in July, fuelled by warm weather and England’s successful Euros football campaign , and 3.1% in June. The latest report also found furniture sales grew for the second month in a row, after months of decline, as did home goods such as appliances, DIY products and garden tools. Linda Ellett, the head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: “Sales of many home goods have been seeing monthly increases since the spike in property transactions ahead of the changes to stamp duty in April. “Home appliances, accessories and DIY and garden tools all saw sales growth in August. New product launches also boosted mobile phone sales.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall non-food sales increased by 1.8% year on year last month, the third consecutive monthly increase. However, the report also found that shopper confidence fell for the third consecutive month in August, with many expecting further food price inflation and other financial pressures. Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said: “The emotional weight of rising energy bills and fears of tax hikes in the autumn budget are adding to the strain, especially as unemployment ticks upward “Yet there are glimmers of relief: interest rates have been cut again, and mortgage rates are easing, offering some financial respite.

David O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, is meeting US counterparts on Monday, as Europe and the US look for tougher measures to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine after Russia launched its largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend. Ahead of those meetings, the head of the European Council, António Costa, hailed transatlantic cooperation over sanctions against Russia and said it was clear that the US remained engaged in supporting Ukraine. Trump says he is ready to impose new sanctions on Russia. What might happen now? Read more A European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that its president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, over the phone on Friday, and “the only topic during the call was Ukraine”. Asked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions against Russia , Trump responded: “Yeah I am,”without elaborating. Trump also said that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and that he would speak to the Russian president soon. Trump has previously threatened tougher measures against Putin, but each time has allowed deadlines to pass without action. Speaking in Helsinki on Monday, Costa said the EU and US were “coordinating our efforts to align our sanctions, to be more effective” and to increase pressure on Putin to join peace negotiations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said the EU needed to increase sanctions on Russia, “but also secondary sanctions” on countries buying gas and oil from Russia. A bar graph showing the number of daily missile and drone strikes in Ukraine The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, “which show further escalation”, a German government spokesperson said on Monday. The spokesperson also said Germany would welcome the US joining Europe in pushing for more sanctions against Russia. In a coordinated move, France and Germany have proposed further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy revenues, including listing non-sanctioned oil majors, such as privately owned Lukoil, as well as going after refineries in foreign countries that re-export Russian oil to the EU. The EU’s two key players also propose increasing pressure on Russia’s civilian economy, via measures targeting civil aviation and engineering. “Russia continues its stalling tactics and persists in refusing a ceasefire,” said a Franco-German paper that calls for increased pressure. Over the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested the US and EU could impose tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil. Bessent said the US was preparing to increase pressure on Russia and urged Europe to do more: “We need our European partners to follow us, because if the US and EU can do this together … we are in a race now between how long the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.” The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India in response to its purchases of discounted Russian oil, but declined to take such punitive action against other large buyers of Russian energy, such as China. The issue of secondary sanctions, which would apply penalties to third countries that trade with Russia, could be difficult for the EU, which is racing to sign new trade deals, including with India, by the end of the year to counter Trump’s tariffs that are roiling international relations. The US focus on Russian energy also puts an uncomfortable spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, favour Trump’s agenda but are also friendly to Putin and have opposed EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028 . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU has pledged to buy $750bn of US oil, gas and nuclear products by 2028. The EU has approved 18 rounds of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, with further proposals expected in the coming days. The last set of EU sanctions, agreed in July, lowered the price cap on Russian oil, closed loopholes to reduce trade in Russian petroleum products and banned vessels carrying Russian energy from European ports. Speaking alongside Costa, Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said cooperation with the US on sanctions was crucial. The latest attacks on Ukraine showed, he said, “that Putin will not stop killing, he will not go to the negotiation tables. That is why we have to cooperate with and negotiate with the US to find a way to do more sanctions, stronger sanctions, do more military support to Ukraine, and build security arrangements to Ukraine.” View image in fullscreen The European Council president, Antonio Costa (left), and the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, during their joint press conference on Monday. Photograph: Roni Rekomaa/AP On Sunday Russia launched its largest-ever barrage on Ukraine , setting the main government building in Kyiv on fire, and killing at least four people, including a woman and her baby. Zelenskyy said Putin was testing the world to see “whether they will accept or tolerate this” and he urged Ukraine’s allies to impose more sanctions and “tough tariffs” on Russia. The Kremlin said on Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on Ukraine.

In 2016, as Venezuela's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031871225/bonus-venezuelas-rise-and-fall\">socioeconomic crisis</a> deepened, Caceres moved to the United States and found a position as a textile designer.</p>\n    <p>\"When I moved here, I was working designing for other people. I wasn't doing anything for myself,\" she said. \"I didn't have time to do anything for myself.\"</p>\n    <p>Worst of all, she had to leave Tobi back in Venezuela. She missed him immensely, and she craved a creative outlet to help her through all the transitions she was going through. So she started a project: Every day, for a whole year, she would draw a different dog. She called the project \"A Dog A Day Keeps the Stress Away,\" and the first dog she drew in January 2018 was, of course, Tobi.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4284x5712+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fba%2Fea1a25754d5d89e48c9345dddf20%2Fandrea-caceres-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Courtesy of Andrea Cáceres\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <p>The illustrations took off.

Inside was an American flag that had flown over the Capitol — sent as a gesture of appreciation for Xie Xide, the renowned Chinese scientist who had recently died. Xie had played a key role in fostering cultural and scientific exchanges between the two countries.</p><p>Stories like this are almost inconceivable today in both the United States and China, as the tone of their bilateral relations has fundamentally shifted. But in the new book, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-encounters-with-america/9780231217194/\"> Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China</a>, profiles of 12 Chinese individuals remind us of the optimism that once defined the two countries' engagement. This optimism has faded away in recent years. </p><p>The dozen profiles in this edited volume highlight the positive aspects of U.S.-China exchange, which began in earnest after diplomatic relations were established in 1979. These accounts range from academics like Xie Xide, to environmental activists like Ma Tianjie, and diplomats like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-f3ada042a03faf8523ff08d270e5e051\">Ji Chaozhu</a>, who served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972.</p><p>Today, as the U.S. and China find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories may be interpreted differently, depending on the reader's own views on the once-popular engagement policy. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, however brief it may have been.</p><p>The book's co-editors, Deborah Davis — a leading sociologist on China — and Terry Lautz, author of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/americans-in-china-9780197512838\"> Americans in China</a>, argue that the book underscores the value of finding common ground.

Why, in your view, did this happen?  </strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz:</strong> China's unexpected arrival as a major economic and military power triggered a downward spiral in the U.S.-China relations. Washington saw China's ascent and its hardline diplomacy as a challenge to the existing world order. Beijing viewed the United States as a threat to its interests, especially the PRC's claim to the island of Taiwan. This new power dynamic undermined the long-held assumption that Sino-American engagement would lead to positive, peaceful change. Instead, it produced a climate of fear and distrust. The aim of our book is to show the benefits of cooperation and mutual understanding despite our differences.</p><p><strong>NPR: In short, how has encountering the U.S. changed these individuals —  and China itself?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>The impact varies over time. Those who returned to an impoverished China during the Cold War faced different challenges and had different motives from those who returned in the 1990s or 2000s when China was more open politically and prosperous. The consequences of their encounters also vary by occupation — from education, dance, and diplomacy to civil society, science, and sports.</p><p>Their life stories are remarkable. For example, Xie Xide, a renowned physicist who received her PhD from MIT in 1951, became the first woman president of a major Chinese research university in 1983. But she also spent years cleaning floors during the Cultural Revolution. Wang Jisi, one of China's most prominent America watchers, spent seven years herding sheep in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution before entering Peking University in 1978. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3726969\">Lang Ping</a>, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/07/04/6647713/pianist-has-passion-for-performing-new-music\">Peng-Peng Gong</a> was trained at the Juilliard School in New York but walked away from a lucrative career as an international concert pianist and returned to China as the resident composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014.

The Chinese Communist Party sent his family to New York City when he was a boy and by the time he returned to New China in 1950, after his sophomore year at Harvard, he could barely speak Chinese.</p><p>The Foreign Ministry sent Ji to make English transcripts of the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom during the Korean War. But because of his American background, it took several years before he could join the Party. He was \"sent down\" to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution but reemerged to interpret for Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai during President Nixon's trip in 1972 and accompanied Deng Xiaoping to the United States in 1979. There were times when he could have sought asylum abroad, but he remained patriotic, convinced that the Communist Party was the best choice for his country's future.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2560x1920+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2018%2F06%2F11%2Fap_7202281627.jpg\" alt=\"President Richard Nixon and China's Premier Chou En-lai pose together at Shanghai Airport before the Nixon departs for the United States on Feb. 28, 1972.\"/><p>\n                Ji Chaozhu (left) served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972.

Did this perspective resonate with any of the individuals you wrote about?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>From what we know of their public lives, none of them would say that engagement with the United States was a mistake— for themselves, for China, or China's relations with America. To the contrary, they came back from the U.S. with knowledge and skills that could be used to make China a strong modern nation. And that's exactly what they did. It was a complex process of adapting what they had learned to fit China's needs while working to improve China's understanding of the United States. All of them saw engagement as an opportunity to advance their careers and to enhance China's global status.</p><p><strong>NPR: Your book spans the Cold War, reconciliation, reform, engagement, and ends with globalization and cooperation. If you were to continue, who might you choose to profile in the current climate of rivalry and distrust?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>We would probably choose someone in science and technology. Take, for example, Abigail Coplin's chapter about Deng Xing Wang, a brilliant plant biologist who grew up in poverty in a farming village in Hunan province. When he left China for graduate study at University of California, Berkeley in 1985, no one could have imagined he would become a chaired professor at Yale University. And no one could have predicted that he would give that up and return to China to start his own company and direct a major research institute. While our governments may see \"American science\" and \"Chinese science\" as separate entities, Deng's story shows that cutting edge research thrives on cooperation as well as competition across national boundaries.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/g-s1-87796/chinese-encounters-with-america-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Take Lin-Manuel Miranda, a composer, lyricist, director and actor best known for creating the musical <i>Hamilton</i>. Not only has he won a \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation, but he's been called a genius in publications like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lin-manuel-miranda-ingenuity-awards-180957234/\"> Smithsonian Magazine</a>, </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/16/why-love-lin-manuel-miranda-crush-bim-adewunmi\">and</a></p><i>The</i><i>Guardian</i><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/yay-hamlet\">BuzzFeed</a>.</p><p>Genius implies something solitary, and we often think of it as innate. Even so, Miranda wasn't the best student when he was young; teachers weren't swooning over his early promise. As Miranda told Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, the author of a new biography, <i>Lin-Manuel Miranda: The Education of an Artist</i>: \"I was never the brightest student at Hunter College Elementary School, but I was good at making up songs, and I was good at making kids laugh, which is the only currency that matters when you are surrounded by people who are much smarter than you.\"</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and a visiting scholar at Portland State University, says that although Miranda is undeniably talented and works very, very hard, his superpower is that he cultivates, collaborates with — and is constantly learning from — a large group of creative friends.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner's new book traces Miranda's career from elementary school musicals, to writing and starring in Disney movies, to his concept album based on the cult-classic film <i>The Warriors</i>.</p><p>Miranda, who has <a href=\"https://x.com/Lin_Manuel/status/667845524171661312\">Puerto Rican and Mexican</a> heritage, grew up in a neighborhood at the top of Manhattan, surrounded by the Latino community he extols in his Tony award-winning musical <i>In the Heights</i>. But he went to school on the snootier, more white Upper East side, which was a tremendous adjustment. He struggled at first — math made him anxious, he disliked his nose, as Pollack-Pelzner writes — but, like a lot of people who feel like they don't fit in, he gravitated toward theater.</p><p>Theater gave Miranda a place to try out his ideas, and he reached out to talented people he knew to help get them up on stage. Pollack-Pelzner writes that Miranda collects people who can teach him something, keeping many of them as lifelong collaborators: one particular friend taught him a bit about composing music; others helped him learn to freestyle. When he was hired to translate some lyrics in <i>West Side Story</i> into Spanish for a new Broadway production, he met the late composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim — and Sondheim became a mentor, helping him navigate the world of musical theater.</p><p>His family has also been a strong source of support. His mother Luz Towns-Miranda, a therapist, helped him process the big feelings that he'd later turn into songs, Pollack-Pelzner explains. His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr., a political strategist, helped him with everything from Puerto Rican slang to financial support for his productions. Miranda's wife, Vanessa Nadal, has also contributed to his successes — she prodded him to include a song for the women in <i>Hamilton</i>, which became \"The Schuyler Sisters.\"</p><p>Miranda regularly publicly thanks and praises those who have supported and taught him, and who have contributed their ideas and talents to his work. That they feel validated by him is evident from the many thoughtful, warm quotes in the book. Pollack-Pelzner says he interviewed more than 150 people and met with Miranda himself more than a dozen times. Miranda shared with him \"early scripts, rough recordings, and grainy videos of sixth-grade musicals, high school one-acts, college projects and pre-Broadway experiments,\" he writes.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner is at his strongest when he delves into the fascinating nitty gritty of the collaborations that help productions come together. People call Miranda a genius because he seamlessly mashes seemingly disparate ideas together (the American Revolution and hip-hop!) to make work that is sparkling with joy, emotionally resonant and blazingly new. And Pollack-Pelzner brings us so deeply into this work — tracing the birth of individual songs line by line — that we feel the zing of creation.</p><p>But this is not a hagiography. Pollack-Pelzner is frank about Miranda's shortcomings, such as the time when the original cast of <i>Hamilton</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/theater/hamilton-producers-and-actors-reach-deal-on-sharing-profits.html\">was fighting to share 1% of the profits</a> for the show's runaway success. Like many original casts, they had helped foster its development. Miranda — who was both a cast member who received a pay check and a creator who received royalties — tried to stay out of it, instead of advocating for them with the lead producer, and he felt \"othered\" by the cast, Pollack-Pelzner explains.</p><p>The book also wades into the murk around Miranda's attempt to influence politics.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2018/06/08/lin-manuel-miranda-amplifies-puerto-rico-fundraising-efforts-with-google-org-2m-matching-grant/\">Miranda raised millions of dollars for relief </a>after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017; he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lin-manuel-miranda-s-hamilton-funds-give-puerto-rican-art-n1040891\">wanted to raise more by bringing  Hamilton</a> to the University of Puerto Rico, his father's alma mater. But in 2016, he had asked Congress in an op-ed to support a bill that would restructure the territory's significant debt. The University of Puerto Rico had been particularly negatively affected — budgets were cut, employees threatened to strike and students protested.</p><p>\"Boy, is <i>Hamilton</i> a bad fit for raising money for Puerto Rico,\" Miranda is quoted as saying in the book. \"It's singing about the financial system that traps Puerto Rico in debt.\"</p><p>The show had to be moved to a different venue and Miranda wound up swearing off politics.</p><h4>Performing Arts</h4><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h2><h4>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h4><p>And yet, it was still a homecoming. When he sang, \"My name is Alexander Hamilton,\" the book recounts, \"Two thousand people rose in a standing ovation that seemed like it would last forever. 'It was the first time I <i>felt</i> a cheer,' he said after the show. 'I felt my hair move.'\"</p><p>But of course, he didn't keep all the praise for himself — at the end of the show, he brought his father onstage to thank him.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner uses these details to treat Miranda as the creator he is — enthusiastic, vulnerable, ambitious, innovative, fallible — instead of as a mere celebrity. A different biographer might have used this as an occasion for dishy name dropping, but Pollack-Pelzner builds the case that Miranda is so successful because he is able to take all the contradictions of who he is, what he's experienced, who he knows, and combine them into work that speaks to so many. And it could be that this talent is, in fact, genius.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5532081/lin-manuel-miranda-biography-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But Winner admits now that she made a crucial miscalculation.</p>\n    <p>\"What I had assumed was they would receive it [and] immediately assume that this was something that was important, that it answered very important questions that the country was having, that it would be protected,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>That's not what happened. Instead, in the process of fact-checking the document, the reporters assigned to the story sent the document to the FBI, which sent it to the NSA. The security agency easily identified Winner, a crypto linguist, as the source of the leak.</p>\n    <p>Looking back now, Winner says her timing could not have been worse; the Trump administration had been combatting a string of leaks. FBI director <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/17/602849276/james-comey-to-fresh-air-the-fbi-isnt-on-anybodys-side\">James Comey</a> and the president \"were both saying that they were going to nail the next leaker to the wall,\" she says. \"And then I just happened to be the very next name popping up.\"</p>\n    <p>Winner was tried under the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/28/534682231/once-reserved-for-spies-espionage-act-now-used-against-suspected-leakers\">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and received the longest sentence to that point for leaking classified information to a media outlet. She accepted a plea deal, lowering her sentence of 10 years to five. She was released from prison in 2021.</p>\n    <p>Winner's story has been told in a 2021 documentary <i>Reality Winner</i>, the 2023 film <i>Reality, </i>and in<i> </i>the play <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1044602235/is-this-a-room-reality-winner-play\"> Is This A Room</a>, in which actors reenacted the transcript of the FBI interrogation of her. Now, she's looking back in a memoir titled</p>\n    <p><i>I Am Not Your Enemy.</i>It's not a tell-all, she says, because she's still bound by the non-disclosure agreement she signed with the NSA.</p>\n    <p>\"I am under a lasting ... non-disclosure agreement to never talk about anything that could be related to classified information from my Air Force career as a linguist, and then, moving forward, anything that I had done as an NSA contractor, and furthermore, anything within the four corners of the document that I leaked,\" she says.</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/994x1500+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2Fd3%2Fd5218f2c49f7a722cdad2adfc1e9%2F71vkiu11jhl-sl1500.jpg\" alt=\"71VKiU11JHL._SL1500_.jpg\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what it was like in the Georgia county jail </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The conditions of that county jail in Lincoln County, Ga. were abhorrent. ... I had been sheltered and privileged and naïve before that. I did not ever imagine that conditions like that would be considered normal or even good for any American in custody. And I was assured several times over that I was being treated the best and that was the most comfortable county jail in the area.</p>\n    <p>I was given this plastic mat with this crumpled plastic wool falling out of it [to sleep on]. It was held together with duct tape. That was my mat. … There was one sink, a picnic table that was covered in rust in the center of the room, a toilet that was about three feet away from that picnic table that we were supposed to sit and eat at, and a shower directly by the toilet with a black mold-crusted shower curtain over it. There was something so dystopian about it. … The toilet had a brown bedsheet draped over it so that you didn't have to eat at the table and make eye contact with somebody using the toilet.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On being transferred to a federal prison in Carswell, Texas</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>My first week there, I felt like I was at Harvard. I couldn't believe how big the compound was. It was two buildings and a very small rec center with a concrete track. <strong>… </strong>My sensory deprivation of 15, 16 months only existing in one room [in the Georgia county jail], I just remembered walking around Carswell and thinking, I'm going to get lost here every single day. It's just so big.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiencing COVID-19 restrictions in prison</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We were confined to our cells, which did not have restrooms. So we had to ask 24-7, seven days a week, to go use the restroom from another adult. We were no longer allowed to go outside and our movements were controlled around the unit. We couldn't just shower when we wanted to shower or go use their phones. As they eased up, we were still not allowed outside of the unit. …</p>\n    <p>The positive mail kept me going. I also had a network where I could just ask for any book I wanted and it would show up. So in addition to getting every single book I heard you talk about on <i>Fresh Air</i> for four years, I was basically the library for everybody in the unit. They would give me their requests and people's books would show up.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling after her release, especially with darkness</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the first time in four years, I had actually seen what a dark room looked like. … I had never been alone in a room before, with the exception of solitary confinement, but that wasn't really alone. So I was just so terrified all the time. I could not feel at ease in any way, shape or form. I never expected that would be something that I would feel. … Nobody tells you that once you get out of prison life just gets harder.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On conflict with her mother after her release</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The biggest point of contention between my mother and I was the status of my notoriety and the fact that she had been out for four years doing interviews about me and ... that she felt obligated to tell her Twitter following updates about me while the halfway house was saying, \"If your presence is detected on social media, or if we feel like you're communicating on social in any way, or that we feel you're in danger, we will take you back into custody.\" And my mother had wanted to tweet that I was home. And I said that they would take me back into custody if people knew I was at that home address. And she said that she wanted to be truthful to her following. And I just felt so offended, like the only reason why you had that following was to support me and I'm sitting right here in front of you and you care more about them than me. … I felt like while I was at my most vulnerable, she was still processing things through being interviewed about me instead of being my mom. And, you know, our relationship is still on the mend.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what she's doing now</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I'm a level two CrossFit coach and I am currently going to Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville in the veterinary technology program. … We did have to send attorneys for permission to at least take the state licensing test so that I could help my school out with passing rates, but [as a convicted felon] I will never be a licensed vet tech.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

It was sent by Mandelson to Epstein in 2008, as the financier prepared to be jailed for soliciting prostitution from someone aged under 18.</p>\n    <p>\"Fight for early release,\" Lord Mandelson is quoted as writing, adding \"your friends stay with you and love you\".</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson doesn't deny these emails.</p>\n    <p>In a statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of his innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\"</p>\n    <p>We have asked him to respond to Bloomberg's revelations.</p>\n    <p>At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked Sir Keir about Lord Mandelson and whether it was \"tenable\" for him to remain as ambassador.</p>\n    <p>Among Labour MPs, there is exasperation.</p>\n    <p>\"I am angry about Keir defending Mandelson today.

I mention this mistake because it testifies to something powerful about Patrick Ryan's new novel, <i>Buckeye</i>.</p><p>When I made a late request for an advance review copy of <i>Buckeye,</i> the copy I received looked fine, but when I opened it I realized it was mistakenly bound backwards. The title page was at the very end of this over-450-page novel. </p><p>So, as a kind of brain exercise, I began reading<i> Buckeye</i> backwards, my head moving from right to left. By page 9, I was already so caught up in the world Ryan creates, <i>Buckeye</i> could have been misprinted upside down and sideways and I still wouldn't have been able to put it down.</p><h4>Author Interviews</h4><h2>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h2><h4>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h4><p>As its title indicates, <i>Buckeye</i> is set in Ohio, in a fictional small town called Bonhomie. The story, which focuses on two married couples, stretches from pre-World War II to the close of the 20th century. Margaret Salt is married to Felix — a closeted gay man who kind of, maybe, harbors the unarticulated hope that marriage might render his same sex desires dormant. </p><p>When the novel opens, Margaret, who's a red-headed, green-eyed \"looker,\" walks into the town hardware store where Cal Jenkins works and demands that he turn on the radio. There's commotion on the streets outside and, especially since her husband, Felix, is serving in the Navy, Margaret wants to know what's happening. It turns out that Germany has just surrendered to the Allies. Hearing the news, Margaret grabs Cal by his shoulders and kisses him. And Cal — a good husband and new father — likes it.</p><p>From that impulsive moment all sorts of complications and secrets sprout. While this teaser of a plot summary may make <i>Buckeye</i> seem like the stuff of vintage soap operas, the atmosphere of this novel is wry and contemplative rather than melodramatic. Ryan — whose previous books include the standout 2016 short story collection, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/485842485/the-dream-life-of-astronauts-is-a-journey-to-emotional-deep-space\"> The Dream Life of Astronauts</a>, as well as three YA novels — ambitiously aims here to write an American epic and he has the chops to do so. Ryan's omniscient narrator takes turns experiencing events from the four main characters' points of view, always subtly underscoring how contingency shapes our lives.</p><p>Cal, for instance, was born with one leg two inches shorter than the other — two inches that would keep him out of World War II and put him in Margaret's path. Cal's wife, Becky, discovered in childhood that she has the ability to communicate with the dead — a gift that will prove to be a grim comfort during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Chapters roam fluidly here from flashbacks to Margaret's tough start in life in an orphanage to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/01/14/462923148/herman-wouk-says-hes-a-happy-gent-at-100\">Herman Wouk</a>-like section chronicling the torpedoing of that cargo ship Felix is serving on. Felix meets the love of his life on that ship, a fellow sailor who quotes St. Thomas Aquinas to him, saying: \"The things that we love tell us what we are.\" The decades-long aftermath of silent grief that Felix must endure after the loss of that relationship is the anguished emotional core of this novel.</p><p>What Ryan captures in <i>Buckeye</i> is both the sweep of history and the mostly mundane particularity of everyday life. If there's a flaw to find in this overwhelming novel it may be that the characters are a bit too uniformly eloquent and self-aware. But, really, why complain about too many epiphanies when they're expressed as beautifully as this? I leave you with our narrator describing Felix in old age realizing something about time:</p><blockquote><p>What is it about time that confounds us? We spend it. We save it. We while it away. We waste it. We kill it. ... We regret what we’ve done with it. We give it away. We want it back. ... Felix saw it so clearly: all we should ever want of time is more of it. Life was so simple when it was reduced to the barest of necessities: more time; more air; more Duke Ellington.</p></blockquote></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5535609/buckeye-patrick-ryan-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For example, he looked for ways to spend his allowance.</p>\n    <p>\"He was kind of a loner, but not in a bad way or a sad way,\" said Bonomo, an English professor at Northern Illinois University. \"He would go to this little dime store and this little fish store.

And so that was probably an extra factor in my being drawn to this book,\" he said.</p>\n    <h3>Henry Huggins' moral dilemma</h3>\n    <p>For Dirda, the ending of the book was a revelation.</p>\n    <p>In the last chapter of the first<i> Henry Huggins</i> (spoiler alert if you haven't read it!), an older boy comes looking for Henry after seeing a picture of him and Ribsy in the local paper. When he sees the dog, he shouts \"Dizzy!\" The dog jumps up on the boy, licks his hands and wags his tail.</p>\n    <p>Cleary writes: \"A terrible thought came to Henry. Ribsy must have belonged to the boy before he found him in the drugstore over a year ago.\"</p>\n    <p>Both boys claim ownership of the dog and tell of how much they care for him. The kids decide to have a contest to let Ribsy choose who gets to keep him.</p>\n    <p>Each boy stands \"twenty squares down the sidewalk in opposite directions\" of the dog. On \"Go,\" the older boy yells \"Here Dizzy!\" while Henry yells \"Here Ribsy!\" The tension builds as Ribsy seems torn, wagging his tail when he looks back and forth at both boys. Ultimately, he walks toward Henry.</p>\n    <p>\"I was glad Henry got to keep his dog,\" Dirda remembers. \"But then I thought, 'The other guy, he loved the dog, too. And is it right that Henry should take his dog?'\"</p>\n    <p>Dirda has written about how Henry Huggins was the first book that forced him to confront a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-henry-huggins-and-lolita-can-teach-us-about-tolerance--and-civil-discourse/2019/12/30/b7862014-2b30-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html\">moral dilemma</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"All these things ran through my head as a kid. And it was at that point that I started to recognize that books were not simple stories with all these Disney kind of happy endings where everything works out perfectly for everybody and everyone is happy,\" said Dirda. It showed him that \"in fact, life is much more complicated and that there are some issues where there isn't a clear cut answer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1920x1502+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fde%2F1f9a940641569cdc37dc1c6a9728%2Fhenry-huggins-jacqueline-rogers-aquarium.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of Henry Huggins.\"/>\n    <p>\n                An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of <i>Henry Huggins.</i>\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    HarperCollins\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <h3>A different dilemma: Native American stereotypes</h3>\n    <p>For decades, Cleary has been praised for her authenticity when describing the experiences of average, middle-class kids. In 1999, Beverly Cleary <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/26/311881785/beverly-cleary-creator-of-ramona-quimby-dies-at-104\">told</a> NPR, \"I think children like to find themselves in books.\" But her lead characters are white, and some of the plotlines perpetuate stereotypes.</p>\n    <p>In more than one Henry book, he pretends to be an American Indian. He's cast as \"Second Indian\" in a school play: He wears a robe and a feather from his mother's duster and says \"Ugh!\" In another book, his mother pretends to be afraid of him when he's dressed up as an Indian for Halloween.</p>\n    <p>Debbie Reese, who writes the blog <a href=\"https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2023/02/stereotypes-in-beverly-clearys-henry.html\">American Indians In Children's Literature</a>, says that while she understands why <i>Henry Huggins</i> is popular, she worries that white kids might \"read right through that problematic content … and not recognize it as harmful or a misrepresentation.\"</p>\n    <p>But Reese says the offensive text shouldn't be excised. She advises educators and parents to make it a teachable moment and tell kids: \"Oh, here's a mistake. That's not true. Native people didn't do this or they didn't look like that. I would like them to take it head on and say that it's a mistake.\"</p>\n    <p>Reese wants young readers and their families to know that \"books are not sacred. They are just someone's words, someone's stories. And some of those stories are wrong.\" At the same time, Reese said she \"wasn't surprised that it had problematic content because most of those classic books do.\"</p>\n    <p>To date, Cleary's first novel has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. She wrote five more <i>Henry Huggins</i> books, with the final one in the series revolving around his canine companion <i>Ribsy</i>. Another character in the series, his mischievous neighbor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/07/23/128689937/ramona-quimby-the-mischievous-girl-next-door\">Ramona Quimby</a>, was so popular that Cleary gave her an eponymous series of her own.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Meghan Sullivan</i>\n      <i> edited this story for broadcast and digital.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5418029/henry-huggins-beverly-cleary-ramona-quimby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nominations open today, with a winner announced on 25 October.</p>\n    <p>To stand, candidates must have the backing of at least 80 MPs and secure that backing this week, and either 5% of local parties or three Labour affiliated groups.</p>\n    <p>The left wing Labour MP Richard Burgon, who served on Jeremy Corbyn's front bench, described it as \"the <a href=\"https://x.com/RichardBurgon/status/1965078718843687342\">mother of all stitch ups</a>\" and later added \"despite the stitch up, Labour members deserve a Left candidate on the ballot.\"</p>\n    <p>But plenty in government and in the wider party want to get the contest done quickly and with minimal noise.</p>\n    <p>The party's general secretary Hollie Ridley told Labour MPs that it was essential that \"we will remain mindful that the Labour Party's primary duty is to serve the country\",</p>\n    <p>Translation: let's not tear ourselves to shreds in public with Labour folk falling over themselves to say why the government hasn't been good enough.</p>\n    <p>\"If there's a contest and you're in government, it is very hard to see how it goes well,\" one longstanding Labour figure tells me.</p>\n    <p>\"We should take the opportunity to abolish the post altogether. It's existence only feeds factional infighting,\" another MP texts, just ahead of the timetable for the contest being set out.</p>\n    <p>This vacancy coincides with a reshuffle that many within the party and beyond regarded as the government tilting to the Right.</p>\n    <p>When the Telegraph of all news organs heralded what it called \"a welcome Rightwards shift\" then perhaps it is little wonder that some on the party's soft Left as well as hard Left might be jittery.</p>\n    <p>They might want those jitters to be expressed and personified in who replaces Angela Rayner.</p>\n    <p>\"If the leadership put forward a serving minister, it could backfire quite badly. The reshuffle was about a particular faction in the party. It eliminated the soft Left from positions of influence,\" claims a Labour veteran.</p>\n    <p>Entering the contest this morning, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who happens to be addressing trades unionists at the TUC Congress in Brighton this afternoon.</p>\n    <p>She and No10 will hope she hoovers up vast amounts of support among MPs to try to give the outcome of any race an air of inevitability.</p>\n    <p>A fellow minister, Alison McGovern, is also weighing up running.</p>\n    <p>But if those outside government, such as Emily Thornberry and Lucy Powell, can persuade enough MPs to back them, they would be far freer to speak their minds in a contest.</p>\n    <p>While either Thornberry or Powell would offer a critique of the government from the Left, others say neither are a true voice of the Labour Left and bemoan a timetable they are convinced is designed to squeeze out a candidate such as Bell Ribeiro-Addy.</p>\n    <p>In the meantime, how loud does the contest become?</p>\n    <p>And then, when we know the winner, the prime minister will have to work out what to do with the party's new deputy.</p>\n    <p>Recent precedent suggests they take a role in government – as Angela Rayner did, and as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6234692.stm\">Harriet Harman </a>did, when she won the deputy leadership in 2007 when Labour was in government. </p>\n    <p>But perhaps that won't happen this time.</p>\n    <p>\"I think that is less of a consideration actually,\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.</p>\n    <p>The consequences of the Angela Rayner property saga are not over yet for Labour.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Sheis wearing a black jacket and an indigo top with a silver chain link necklace.\"/>\n    <p>The ripple effects of the Angela Rayner saga roll on.</p>\n    <p>A cacophony of Labour voices now, via an official party process, are offering their views in public about whether the government is any good or not.</p>\n    <p>You don't need to be steeped in political strategy to grasp why some in and around Downing Street could really have done without this and want it all over as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>So far, we have seen a limited amount of the contenders: the Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson gave a speech to trades unionists at the TUC Congress in Brighton, in which she made no reference to the contest at all.</p>\n    <p>The left winger Bell Ribeiro-Addy has done some interviews with journalists and Alison McGovern has popped up on Newsnight.</p>\n    <p>Some of the others I have spoken to will be out and about before long, but are focused for now on touring the tearooms and attempting to fill their spreadsheets with the names of supporters.</p>\n    <p>Time is tight and the bar is high – cobbling together 80 people willing to back you in a handful of days isn't easy.</p>\n    <p>Already, though, we have had an insight into how awkward this race could prove for the government, depending on who makes it through the early stages.</p>\n    <p>Take Emily Thornberry. She served in Sir Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet before the general election and expected to be offered a cabinet job in his government after Labour had won.</p>\n    <p>No such offer came.</p>\n    <p>Now she is running to be deputy leader of the party. It is a story line with a certain soap opera appeal.</p>\n    <p>And already Thornberry has been punchily critical of the government, in just one post on social media.</p>\n    <p>\"We've made mistakes and must listen. Welfare. Gaza. Wealth tax,\" she wrote, adding, archly that she wouldn't \"just nod along,\" a line seemingly aimed at Phillipson and Alison McGovern, the other candidate who is also a government minister.</p>\n    <p>Imagine Labour's deputy leader, were Thornberry to win, spending the autumn talking up a wealth tax, in the weeks before the Budget in November.</p>\n    <p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, she has a lot of MPs to find to back her.</p>\n    <p>Attempting to do that, and in just a few days, led Ribeiro-Addy to publicly complain about the process being anti democratic.</p>\n    <p>She has also criticised the government for not scrapping the two-child benefit cap, she wants a full arms embargo and sanctions to be imposed on Israel, and the ban on Palestine Action to be removed.</p>\n    <p>Of course, hers is a campaign that may only last a few days. Let's see.</p>\n    <p>So, how many of the candidates are serious contenders here, and who are they?</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson is well on the way to 80 MPs backing her already, with 44.</p>\n    <p>Lucy Powell isn't far behind with 35.</p>\n    <p>The others are all in single figures.</p>\n    <p>But hundreds of Labour MPs are yet to endorse anyone.</p>\n    <p>The key question now is which candidates clear this first hurdle, and how many of them are not in government and so more free to criticise it as the race heads to its next stage?</p>\n    <p>This is likely to be a key factor in shaping the tenor and tone of the debate that follows – and the eventual winner.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Beside him, two senior Reform figures applaud.\"/>\n    <p>This is the most fascinating party conference I have ever been to.</p>\n    <p>Yes, I am an insufferable nerd: I have been coming to things like this for 20 years.</p>\n    <p>I have been to Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Scottish National Party, UKIP and Green Party conferences.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, an admission. I arrived late here.</p>\n    <p>I'm blaming Angela Rayner and the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgmzgjywr8wo\">government reshuffle that followed her resignation</a>, which meant I had to be in London on Friday.</p>\n    <p>What is fascinating about this gathering is it illustrates the pace of growth of Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>It is a vastly bigger gathering than the party had last year.</p>\n    <p>It now feels like a big party conference - but retains the insurgency vibe that the party is seeking to channel.</p>\n    <p>That is the unique combination I have never seen before.</p>\n    <p>Scaling up while holding onto that newbie energy will be a challenge.</p>\n    <p>We got a sense of that at the conference with two moments.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62z4rd87nlo\">I have written here about the party having to pretty much disown remarks by the cardiologist Aseem Malhotra</a> about the Royal family, cancer and Covid vaccines.</p>\n    <p>The party had chosen to give Malhotra a platform at their conference.</p>\n    <p>And the decision to give a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yl7p4l11po\">platform to Lucy Connolly</a>, who was jailed for stirring up racial hatred on X.</p>\n    <p>Is she an appropriate guest given the crime she admitted to?</p>\n    <p>The party argues there is a live and very legitimate debate to be had over the appropriateness or otherwise of her sentence and that was the conversation they were having.</p>\n    <p>Two examples of the judgement calls Reform has to make - how to remain distinctive and anti-establishment, while expanding and broadening their appeal.</p>\n    <p>UKIP in its pomp had an insurgency feel about it, but its focus was much narrower and it was never talked of as a potential government.</p>\n    <p>Its conferences, at Doncaster Racecourse, Exeter and Torquay among other places, were proudly rather homespun in feel.</p>\n    <p>This year, Reform has hired Birmingham's NEC.</p>\n    <p>It is huge and it would be easy to leave a sense of rattling around in a tin in here, but it is busy.</p>\n    <p>I recognise one of the big catering trucks in here from one of the other party's conferences.</p>\n    <p>The corporate lounge sponsored by Heathrow Airport is another staple of the big conferences.</p>\n    <p>So far, so conventional, if you like – for a big party.</p>\n    <p>But then I spot a queue of folk waiting for Nigel Farage to sign their light blue Reform UK football shirt, bought at the nearby merchandise shop.</p>\n    <p>The number 10 and Farage on the back of them all is not exactly subtle about this movement's ambitions.</p>\n    <p>Can you imagine Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch, Ed Davey or John Swinney pulling that off?</p>\n    <p>Not in a million years.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e19f/live/78ff6360-8b46-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A woman hangs up pale blue football shirts, with Farage 10 on the back of them, at the Reform conference\"/>\n    <p>In another corner of the main exhibition hall are 10 stands, each representing a region of England or a nation of the UK.</p>\n    <p>They are indicative of the growth and professionalising Reform is attempting at lightning speed – setting up the local branch network and army of volunteers a successful national political party requires.</p>\n    <p>It's the unglamorous side of politics, a long way from the whizzy pyrotechnics of Nigel Farage's conference speech, but arguably more important.</p>\n    <p>A couple from Suffolk stop for a chat.</p>\n    <p>They have never been to a party conference before and had never been in a political party until they joined Reform recently.</p>\n    <p>Another couple from Glasgow tell a similar story.</p>\n    <p>There are plenty of sharp-suited young men about too.</p>\n    <p>Two blokes having lunch together call me over.

Who needs them, when you can suck readers into dramas about foster care, grave robbers, meth dealers or high-stakes, high-school hockey matches?</p><p>Author Angeline Boulley has written her third thriller for teenagers, <i>Sisters in the Wind, </i>which came out the first week in September.</p><p>All of her books have been set in Native American communities in northern Michigan, like the ones where Boulley's Ojibwe family has lived for generations.</p><p>Her new book features a heroine named Lily, a young woman on the run after a series of tragedies. Some characters, and some of those tragedies, will be familiar to readers of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/20/979303110/firekeepers-daughter-forges-a-new-path-between-cultures-and-genres\"> Firekeeper's Daughter</a> and </p><p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/05/10/1172699332/warrior-girl-unearthed-firekeepers-daughter-novel-angeline-boulley\">the two earlier books in Boulley's loosely connected series.</a></p><i>Warrior Girl Unearthed</i>,<p>An enrolled member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Boulley worked for her tribe for decades, then served as director of the Office of Indian Education at the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p>\"So my stories are all set in this fictionalized version of my tribe and my community,\" Boulley told NPR. Her characters' conversations include debates over the pros and cons of tribal enrollment and issues around casinos, Ojibwe mythology, the preservation of ancient medical practices and <a href=\"https://www.michiganpublic.org/education/2021-07-08/the-legacy-of-michigans-native-boarding-schools-and-how-tribes-are-reclaiming-what-was-lost\">generational trauma from boarding schools</a>.</p><p>Boulley grew up in New Buffalo, Mich. When she was in high school, a friend told her about a cute new student. Boulley never met him; she was an overachiever and he hung out with kids involved with drugs. He turned out to be an undercover police officer. (\"This was before <i>21 Jump Street</i>, with Johnny Depp!\" she laughed.) But still, she wondered at the time: What if they'd met, and liked each other? What if, somehow, he needed her help?</p><p>\"And then I had this thought that stayed with me for 36 years,\" she said. \"And it was, why would some undercover drug investigation need the help of an ordinary 18-year-old Ojibwe girl?\"</p><p>And why would that girl help him? Those questions became the basis of Boulley's first book. She pitched <i>Firekeeper's Daughter </i>to literary agents on Twitter. It <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/81406-debut-ya-by-member-of-chippewa-tribe-sells-in-seven-figure-deal.html\">sold in 2019 for more than $1 million</a>. And in 2021, it became an instant bestseller. So was her next novel, 2023's <i>Warrior Girl Unearthed</i>, which she says she pitched like this: \"It's indigenous Lara Croft, but instead of raiding tombs, she's raiding museums and private collections to retrieve stolen ancestors and sacred items that do not belong in museums and in private collections. But the main character is 16, and so none of her heists go the way that she plans.\"</p><p><i>Warrior Girl Unearthed</i> is a favorite book of educational consultant Becky Hill, who attended a conference in August in Ann Arbor, Mich., about amplifying indigenous narratives.<a href=\"https://news.a2schools.org/aaps-celebrates-ambitious-indigenous-education-initiative-with-day-long-summit/\"> Boulley was the keynote speaker</a>. \"I had never read a book that discussed museums and Native American artifacts and the theft of them and the return of them,\" Hill said. \"And I went to school on a reservation from K through 8 and I cannot recall any books that had to do with Native American people other than <i>The Indian in the Cupboard</i>.\"</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3024x4032+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F70%2F0685215d468795407885c89aad20%2Fimg-9428.jpeg\" alt=\"Angeline Boulley\"/><p>\n                <i>Sisters in the Wind </i>is Angeline Boulley's third thriller for teens.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Angeline Boulley/Henry Holt &amp; Co.

    "body": "<p>Looking at Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet reshuffle it appears that he came to believe that he had all the right ministers at the cabinet table - just sitting in the wrong chairs.</p>\n<p>The most significant change is the appointment of Shabana Mahmood as home secretary, which is intended as a clear signal that dealing with illegal immigration and asylum is one of the government's biggest priorities.</p>\n<p>That was the former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's view too, but there was a sense among some - not all - at the top of government that she was moving too slowly to meet public opinion.</p>\n<p>There was particular frustration at Reform UK's ability to drive the narrative on the issue over the summer even when the government had achievements to herald, including its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce35v0zyzvlo\">\"one in one out\" agreement with France</a>.</p>\n<p>Mahmood has a reputation among Labour MPs as (relatively-speaking, in Labour terms) a hardliner on immigration.</p>\n<p>\"She's really right-wing on this stuff,\" one Labour figure who knows her well said.</p>\n<p>From this person it was a compliment; from others in the Labour movement who are anxious about losing votes to the Greens and others on the left, it would not be.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, though, what different policies will Mahmood pursue? That's not so clear.</p>\n<p>At the weekend John Healey, the defence secretary, said the government was looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels.</p>\n<p>That was in the works before the reshuffle. It may be that Mahmood seeks to accelerate the timetable for closing hotels.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir has said that he wants to close them all before the next general election though he alluded in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live last week to bringing that deadline forward.</p>\n<p>Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from which both Reform UK and increasingly the Conservatives say the UK must withdraw to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.</p>\n<p>Cooper was looking at ways to change UK law to make clearer to judges here the way in which the government believes the convention should be interpreted.</p>\n<p>Mahmood may want to go further but it is hard to see how that would be possible given Lord Hermer, who remains in post as attorney general, not to mention the prime minister himself, are both ardently opposed to withdrawal.</p>\n<p>We may not need to wait long to find out what Mahmood's new direction will be. Only a week after taking office as justice secretary last year, she announced plans to release thousands of prisoners earlier than planned to avoid what she called \"total collapse\" of the prison system.</p>\n<p>Her handling of prison overcrowding, especially her willingness to grasp the nettle so early on, has been frequently compared favourably by Labour MPs to other cabinet ministers who were seen as taking too long to work out how they wanted to deal with their portfolios.</p>\n<p>One ally of Mahmood told the BBC: \"She knows that time is of the essence. She didn't take long to take big decisions at the Ministry of Justice, and she doesn't tend to hang about.\"</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes might come in rhetoric and communication style.</p>\n<p>Cooper was shadow home secretary for seven years in two stints and also spent five years as chairwoman of the home affairs select committee. Some in Labour pushing for a harder line on immigration occasionally complained that her deep knowledge of the issues involved made her public comments too nuanced to embody public dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>Mahmood is likely to go another way.</p>\n<p>That was definitely the sense from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7xyn03yno\">her first brief interview in the role</a> on Monday, in which she repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration, suggested she could withdraw visas from countries that do not \"play ball\" on migrant returns and embraced the potential introduction of ID cards  - all in clear, plain language.</p>\n<p>Mahmood, 44, has been an MP for 15 years representing a constituency in Birmingham, but it is only in the past two years that she has moved into front-line, high-profile roles.</p>\n<p>After spending her first five years in Parliament in a range of junior shadow ministerial portfolios, she co-chaired Cooper's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 2015. She then refused to serve under Jeremy Corbyn, instead dedicating her time during his leadership to fighting those on Labour's left-wing from a position on Labour's national executive committee, to which she was elected by Labour MPs.</p>\n<p>In 2021, at the lowest ebb of Sir Keir's leadership, she was brought into the shadow cabinet to take charge of Labour's election campaign infrastructure. Even in that job, though, she was pushing her party to get over what she called its \"queasiness\" about talking tough on immigration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/shabana-mahmood-the-woman-behind-labours-election-campaign-pk5vx3bn3\">In an interview with the Times in 2023</a>, she said: \"In the commentariat, among very politically engaged people, there's a sort of assumption about who is motivated by immigration as an electoral issue. </p>\n<p>\"My constituency experience is that, actually, that's not got very much to do with race. I represent a very diverse constituency that's 70% non-white, and immigration comes up as an issue that my voters who are black or Asian and from other ethnic minorities want to talk about.\"</p>\n<p>That is an argument you can be sure she will be making as home secretary in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9rg9jj5kro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>For a party that makes a lot of noise in British politics, Reform UK has relatively few senior elected politicians.</p>\n<p>And one man, its leader Nigel Farage, who's a true household name.</p>\n<p>That was evident at this week's conference, where the party's four MPs had a busy schedule of prominent speaking slots, alongside lesser-known figures the party wants to promote.</p>\n<p>The party is keen to get away from the idea that it is a one-man-band - or \"the Nigel show\", as long-time Farage ally Gawain Towler puts it.</p>\n<p>That was fair criticism a year ago, says Towler, but not now as more of its new recruits are getting out into \"Tellyland\".</p>\n<p>Reform wants to gain significantly more seats in councils and parliaments across the country in the coming years, and its lead in national opinion polls suggest that ambition is not unrealistic.</p>\n<p>But to increase Reform UK's electoral footprint, the party will need a lot more candidates willing to join its ranks.</p>\n<p>The party conference is good opportunity to thrust some of these hopefuls into the spotlight to see how they perform.</p>\n<h2>'The people's army'</h2>\n<p>Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham is one such hopeful. She seems to be everywhere you turn in Birmingham, popping up on three panels, including two appearances on the main stage.</p>\n<p>A lawyer and former prosecutor, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK in June, she says she entered politics to improve outcomes for the victims of crime.</p>\n<p>A Conservative supporter since a teenager, Cunningham says she was a \"huge fan\" of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n<p>\"But the Tory party changed,\" she says, accusing the Conservatives of failures over home ownership, taxation and crime over many years.</p>\n<p>She has been tipped to be Reform's candidate for the London mayoral election in 2028, although she's coy about that prospect and stresses the party hasn't even started the selection process yet.</p>\n<p>\"I'll help the party in any way they need me,\" she says.</p>\n<p>Stephen Atkinson is the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council - another name party bosses have high hopes for.</p>\n<p>A self-taught engineer who set up a business that makes school furniture, Atkinson rose through the ranks of local politics with the Conservative Party in north-west England.</p>\n<p>Then the Brexit years came, and like an increasing number of Reform UK's new joiners, Atkinson quit the Conservatives after becoming disillusioned with the party.</p>\n<p>Since becoming council leader in Lancashire in May, Atkinson says he has focused on the \"huge financial challenges\" facing his Reform UK administration, alongside bread-and-butter issues such as fixing potholes.</p>\n<p>In the future, he says, it would be a \"great honour\" to be a parliamentary candidate for the party where he lives in the Ribble Valley, if he was selected.</p>\n<p>\"But that's a decision for other people,\" he adds.</p>\n<p>If Reform does manage to get into government, and four years out from a general election it is still a very big \"if\", some of the party's would-be MPs may find fewer opportunities to rise to the highest levels of politics.</p>\n<p>Farage and Zia Yusuf, the party's new head of policy, have talked about appointing dozens of new peers to take up roles in a Reform UK cabinet.</p>\n<p>Could former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries - unveiled this week to much fanfare as Reform UK's latest Tory defector - be drafted into the Lords?</p>\n<p>Former Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry was also doing the media rounds in Birmingham, and was seen walking into Friday night's afterparty in the main hall, where US pop legends the Jacksons made a surprise appearance on stage.</p>\n<p>Like one of the back-up singers, Berry may be one of those called upon to make up the numbers in one of the many elections Reform UK wants to win.</p>\n<p>In his conference speech, Farage said the party was taking the London mayoral election \"seriously\", as well as polls in Wales and Scotland next year.</p>\n<p>He said Reform needed 5,000 vetted candidates to fight those polls, which he called \"an essential building block as we head towards a general election\".</p>\n<p>As he closed the Birmingham conference, he called for volunteers in the audience to get to their feet if they wanted to stand in next year's elections.</p>\n<p>\"This is the people's army in operation,\" Farage said.</p>\n<p>In a symbolic gesture, some in the audience did stand, but the actual process for selection is designed to be far more rigorous.</p>\n<p>Candidate selection has always been a thorny issue for Farage's various electoral vehicles, with election campaigns blown off course by scandals.</p>\n<p>Party insiders like to describe Reform's rapid expansion - while ensuring candidates are properly vetted - as being like assembling a jumbo jet while flying it.</p>\n<p>They insist they have improved their vetting system since last year's general election, after some candidates were ditched or suspended over offensive comments on social media ahead of the general election.</p>\n<p>The party now has assessment centres, where candidates are put through their paces, and a centre for excellence, where activists are caught how to campaign effectively.</p>\n<p>Thomas Kerr, the former group leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy48p5132qno\">defected to Reform in January</a>, was also doing the rounds of the fringe panels in Birmingham, and says he hopes to stand in next year's Holyrood elections.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl1k744548o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025.</p>\n<p>The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style.</p>\n<p>And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times.</p>\n<p>These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping \"How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy\" was a joke.</p>\n<p>And what was planned as No 10's \"get back in charge week\" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jl43400jo\">not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax</a> on her expensive new house.</p>\n<p>Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team.</p>\n<p>The start of this political season has been wild.</p>\n<p>In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut.</p>\n<p>The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken.</p>\n<p>Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed.</p>\n<p>There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake.</p>\n<p>It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster.</p>\n<p>It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis.</p>\n<p>She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called \"Mr Rules\" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, <i>ahem</i>, flexible attitude to the normal rules.</p>\n<p>She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust.</p>\n<p>For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the \"service of the people\", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels.</p>\n<p>For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, \"it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight\".</p>\n<p>And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world.</p>\n<p>\"There's just the smell test,\" a Labour insider said.</p>\n<p>This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not.</p>\n<p>Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now.</p>\n<p>The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument.</p>\n<p>Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust.</p>\n<p>Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0veg88g7jyo\">Making changes to his ministers.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making.</p>\n<p>Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: \"None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership.\"</p>\n<p>You and I might translate that as: \"The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway.\"</p>\n<p>One insider described it as moving those who were \"a bit awkward, or a bit tired\".</p>\n<p>What those changes add up to depends on who you ask.</p>\n<p>One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle \"is all about immigration\", believing \"Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this\" to solve the small boats issue or \"we're all done for\".</p>\n<p>Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings.</p>\n<p>But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper.</p>\n<p>Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't bet we'll see her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr68vde7nvo\">meeting JD Vance in waders</a> any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that.</p>\n<p>Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry.</p>\n<p>He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical.</p>\n<p>But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves.</p>\n<p>This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition.</p>\n<p>His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the \"time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long\", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck.</p>\n<p>Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: \"I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions.\"</p>\n<p>This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for.</p>\n<p>\"Phase 2\" was meant to be \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". Another bout of political jargon that followed, \"change\", \"renewal\", \"security\", \"fairness\", \"milestones\", \"first steps\", you get the point.</p>\n<p>Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing.</p>\n<p>\"You can see the problem from Mars,\" another party insider says, \"there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything\", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week.</p>\n<p>But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work.</p>\n<p>And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39rk4jlpw7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Angela Rayner has resigned as deputy prime minister, housing secretary and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, after admitting <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c0lk8ye1979t\">she underpaid tax after buying a flat in Hove</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is her resignation letter in full, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's response and a letter from Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial ethics, in which he sets out that Rayner breached the ministerial code.</p>\n<h2>Rayner's resignation letter</h2>\n<p>Dear Keir,</p>\n<p>Thank you for the personal and public support you have shown me in recent days. As you know, on Wednesday I referred myself to your Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to conduct a thorough investigation into my personal financial circumstances after I became aware that it is likely I inadvertently paid the incorrect rate for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).</p>\n<p>I have always taken my responsibilities as Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as a Member of Parliament with the utmost seriousness. I have long believed that people who serve the British public in government must always observe the highest standards, and while the Independent Adviser has concluded that I acted in good faith and with honesty and integrity throughout, I accept that I did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.</p>\n<p>I deeply regret my decision to not seek additional specialist tax advice given both my position as Housing Secretary and my complex family arrangements. I take full responsibility for this error. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount.</p>\n<p>I must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family. While I rightly expect proper scrutiny on me and my life, my family did not choose to have their private lives interrogated and exposed so publicly. I have been clear throughout this process that my priority has, and always will be, protecting my children and the strain I am putting them under through staying in post has become unbearable.</p>\n<p>Given the findings, and the impact on my family, I have therefore decided to resign as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>\n<p>For a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport to serve as the highest level of government has been the honour of my life. The challenges of government are nothing compared to the challenge of putting food on the table and getting a roof over our head when I brought up kids working as a home help. Too many people face the same across our country.</p>\n<p>I've always known that politics changes lives because it changed mine. The last Labour government gave me the tools I needed to build a better life for me and my young son, and that's why I've been working relentlessly from day one in government to do the same for the next generation. Every day I had in office, I worked to serve working class communities like the one that I grew up in, which are too often overlooked by those in power. I am proud that in every decision I made, I did it for them. I would never have become Deputy Prime Minister if not for the decisions taken by the last Labour Government, giving me a council house to support me, Sure Start to help raise my kids, and the security of a minimum wage - and I can only hope that the changes I made in government will have the same impact for young girls growing up on council estates like I did.</p>\n<p>Through my Employment Rights Bill people across the country will receive the biggest uplift in workers' rights in a generation. This landmark legislation will be game changing for millions of people stuck in insecure and low-paid work, giving them the dignity and security they don't just need but also deserve. I am and will remain deeply proud of that legacy. I am so proud to have worked alongside the trade union movement, who have given me everything, to deliver that.</p>\n<p>Our Renters' Rights Bill will finally ban the oppressive rule of no-fault evictions and will reset the balance between renters and landlords through ground breaking protection for renters. Everyone deserves to live in a safe and decent home, and I know this legislation will deliver that for millions of people across the country.</p>\n<p>The Planning and Infrastructure Bill will also be instrumental in getting the homes so many people across this country need built, and I am so proud that at the Spending Review we announced the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation with the overwhelming amount of this going to genuinely social rent homes.</p>\n<p>And last week, I introduced the English Devolution Bill to Parliament. The largest single package of devolution from any Westminster government to local people across England. This landmark legislation will permanently change the balance of power, giving true control to those with skin in game. We delivered an Elections Strategy which will mean 16 and 17 year olds getting the vote for the first time, as well as ambitious plans to ensure the most marginalised communities are registered to vote. We took steps to stabilise the broken foundations of local government and deliver the first genuinely fair funding review and the first multi-year settlement for a decade.</p>\n<p>My department, through my excellent team of Ministers, has also provided the largest ever investment in homelessness prevention services to local authorities, to get Britain back on track to ending homelessness for good. We've worked relentlessly to bring an end to the building safety crisis and developed new measures to get peoples' homes fixed quicker and hold rogue freeholders to account. We've also worked to boost community cohesion, tackle hate crime and reset the relationship with faith communities.</p>\n<p>I have been lucky to work alongside the most talented group of Ministers who worked with dedication to deliver for working people. I thank Matthew Pennycook, Jim McMahon, Alex Norris, Wajid Khan and Sharon Taylor. I too am grateful to my brilliant parliamentary team, Harpreet Uppal, Mark Ferguson, and Gen Kitchen.</p>\n<p>For me, being in office is the chance to change the lives of the people I grew up alongside. I will do whatever I can to continue doing so.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your leadership and for your friendship. I will continue to serve you, our country and the party and movement I love in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Rt. Hon. Angela Rayner MP Representing Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Droylsden and Dukinfield Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government</p>\n<h2>Sir Keir's reply to Rayner</h2>\n<p>Dear Angela,</p>\n<p>Thank you for informing me of your decision to resign from the Government. I am very sad that your time as Deputy prime Minister, Secretary of State and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party has ended in this way.</p>\n<p>As you know we acted in accordance with the strengthened system relating to ministerial conduct that we put in place on coming into Government. You were right to refer yourself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards and right to act on his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Although I believe you have reached the right decision, it is a decision which I know is very painful for you. You have given your all to making the Labour Government a success and you have been a central part of our plan to make Britain fairer for working families. Your work at MHCLG to help build the homes that Britain needs has been hugely important and your work to create more fairness in the workplace through the Employment Rights Bill represents a very significant achievement that will change the lives of millions of people.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I am very sad to be losing you from the Government. You have been a trusted colleague and a true friend for many years. I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievement in politics. I know that many people of all political persuasions admire that someone as talented as you is the living embodiment of social mobility.</p>\n<p>Even though you won't be part of the Government, you will remain a major figure in our party. I know that you will continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about.</p>\n<p>My very best wishes, and with real sadness,</p>\n<p>Keir</p>\n<h2>Ethics adviser's letter to PM on Rayner's conduct</h2>\n<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>\n<p>Following a self-referral by The Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 3 September 2025, I have undertaken an examination of the circumstances and facts connected to recent allegations about Ms Rayner's property ownership and tax affairs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyn051990o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

First-time buyers do not pay stamp duty on properties worth up to £300,000.</p>\n    <p>Those buying homes worth more pay a percentage of the value of the home.</p>\n    <p>Colleen Babcock, Rightmove's property expert, says the tax is \"a huge barrier to movement, from first-time buyers to downsizers\".</p>\n    <p>However, getting rid of stamp duty would also mean lost revenue, with £11.6bn raised from the tax in the last financial year.</p>\n    <p>As such, reports suggest any abolition of stamp duty would come alongside other property tax changes.</p>\n    <h2>Introducing a national property tax</h2>\n    <p>One such replacement for stamp duty could be a national proportional property tax on homes worth over £500,000.</p>\n    <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ukonward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Onward-A-Fairer-Property-Tax.pdf\">a report by Dr Tim Leunig for the centre-right think tank Onward</a>, which is said to be influencing the Treasury's thinking, the tax would be payable by buyers of homes over that threshold but on a yearly basis after purchase rather than upfront.</p>\n    <p>The annual rate would be set by the government, but the report suggests it should be a 0.54% tax levied on home value between £500,000 and £1m when bought, and a higher rate for any home value beyond £1m.</p>\n    <p>For example, if someone bought a property for £600,000, they would only pay the 0.54% rate on £100,000. Meanwhile, people purchasing homes valued under £500,000 would not pay anything.</p>\n    <p>The report said this tax would raise as much as stamp duty each year, but Savills' head of residential research Lucian Cook said a gradual annual levy would not replace the lost revenue that stamp duty upfront payments provide immediately.</p>\n    <h2>Replacing council tax</h2>\n    <p>Council tax is a levy which funds your local authority. It is devolved in Scotland and Wales, while Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system, instead of council tax.</p>\n    <p>In England and Scotland, it is based on what the value of the property you live in was in 1991 or - if the property was built after then - what the value of the property would have been in 1991. In Wales, it is based on what the value of the property you live in was in 2003.</p>\n    <p>Critics say this way of valuing properties is complicated and also argue that there are unfair disparities because it is calculated at a council level.</p>\n    <p>This means two people both living in homes with the exact same value would not pay the same council tax if they lived in two different council areas.</p>\n    <p>Despite widespread opposition to the current council tax system, government proposals for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy4dv2dgjeko\">changes to the system have also come under scrutiny</a> for taking money away from some areas to increase funding in others.</p>\n    <p>This highlights the difficulty the government might face in trying to overhaul council taxes.</p>\n    <p>The Treasury has not commented on any of the recent reports.</p>\n    <p>\"We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible,\" a spokesperson said.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Clarification 11 September: This article was amended to provide more context and to reflect the fact that certain taxes are devolved issues.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2k1m56xgjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Until this week, Angela Rayner was considered to be one of the most powerful women in Britain, a deputy prime minister who was widely tipped to be a future candidate for the top job in politics.</p>\n<p>A self-described \"proper working-class\" woman, Rayner grew up in poverty and left school without any qualifications at 16.</p>\n<p>She became the first female MP for the Greater Manchester seat of Ashton-under-Lyne in 2015, before entering high office in the wake of last year's landslide election victory</p>\n<p>It was a remarkable journey.</p>\n<p>But Rayner's extraordinary rise to the apex of British politics with the Labour Party has culminated in an equally spectacular fall.</p>\n<p>The 45-year-old resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she did not pay enough tax on the purchase of a new home.</p>\n<p>She has also stepped down as deputy leader of the Labour Party.</p>\n<p>It means a return to the backbenches for a high-profile MP who was considered to be a big political asset to her party and who remains a popular figure within many Labour circles and beyond.</p>\n<p>Her against-the-odds story, personality, and ability to connect with parts of the electorate that might be less accessible to others, gave her a special status in Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet and underscores why she will be so hard to replace.</p>\n<h2>Tough upbringing</h2>\n<p>Born Angela Bowen in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 1980, Rayner grew up on one of the area's poorest council estates and from an early age, was caring for her mother, who had bipolar disorder and suffered from depression.</p>\n<p>Both Rayner's parents were unemployed and speaking in 2017, she remembered having to grow up very quickly.</p>\n<p>\"My mum was a really vulnerable person. I remember, at 10, my mum being suicidal and me sleeping like a dog on the end of her bed, just to try and stay next to her so she didn't do any harm to herself,\" Rayner said.</p>\n<p>She has also recalled going to her grandmother's flat on Sundays, so the family could take it in turns to have a bath there. Hot water was too expensive for them to use at home.</p>\n<p>Rayner has often spoken about being told she would \"never amount to anything\", after she left school without any qualifications.</p>\n<p>But after having her first child at 16, Rayner studied part-time at college, learning British sign language and gaining a vocational qualification in social care.</p>\n<p>She spent a number of years as a care worker in Stockport, mainly looking after elderly people in their own homes, while also rising quickly through the ranks of the union, Unison.</p>\n<p>She has described herself as \"mouthy\", someone who would \"take no messing from management\".</p>\n<p>In her 20s, she became a full-time union official and eventually, after battles over working conditions and zero-hour contracts, rose to the most senior elected role in Unison in north-west England.</p>\n<p>It was at Unison she met Mark Rayner, a fellow union official whom she married in 2010 and divorced in 2023. The couple went on to have two sons, one of whom was born so prematurely he is registered blind and has special educational needs.</p>\n<p>At the age of 37, the mum-of-three became a grandmother, sparking the nickname \"Grangela\".</p>\n<p>She credits the trade union movement with encouraging her to enter politics and taking her from - in her own words - \"the girl on a council estate\" to \"a woman who feels like she can conquer the world\".</p>\n<p>Those ambitions started to be realised in 2015, when she was elected as the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne - a seat not far from her hometown. She later said she had only stood to make the point that \"people like me can't get elected\" and had \"accidentally\" won the seat.</p>\n<h2>The Prescott role</h2>\n<p>Rayner rose quickly in Westminster, taking up the women and equalities, and education briefs in the shadow cabinet of former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n<p>When Corbyn stood down in 2020, following Labour's worst general election result since 1935, Rayner did not run for the leadership, and backed her ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second to Sir Keir.</p>\n<p>Instead, Rayner stood for the deputy leadership and won election to that post comfortably - going on to be a central figure in Sir Keir's bid to remake the party.</p>\n<p>But relations between Sir Keir and Rayner have sometimes been tense. After Labour lost control of eight English councils and lost the seat of Hartlepool in a parliamentary by-election in May 2021, the deputy leader was removed from her post as party chairwoman.</p>\n<p>She pushed back and was appointed shadow first secretary of state among other titles.</p>\n<p>By that point, Rayner had a strong support base and a powerful role likened to that of John Prescott, who was seen as a political bridge between the working class and the New Labour project during Tony Blair's premiership.</p>\n<p>Rayner heavily leaned into that role and tried to use it to her party's advantage in the years before Labour's general election win in 2024.</p>\n<p>Outspoken and combative at times, Rayner repeatedly accused the Conservatives of being \"out of touch\", and hammered the party with lines such as \"one rule for them and another rule for us\" during the scandal over pandemic parties in Downing Street.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Rayner admitted she had gone too far, once apologising for describing senior Conservatives as \"a bunch of scum\".</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlz3p0ryylo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On 3 October 2021, Reform UK held its first conference - a modest one-day get-together in Manchester - only a short distance from the much larger Conservative Party gathering, taking place nearby at the city's Convention Complex at the same time.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At the Reform event, only a few hundred activists were present in the function room - and Nigel Farage, not yet party leader, was reportedly not among them. Reform was polling around 3% and had won just two councillors in that May's local elections.</p>\n<p>What a difference four years makes.</p>\n<p>Reform's annual conference takes place this weekend in Birmingham, with 5,500 tickets reportedly already sold. It is thought that one in five of the nation's lobbyists will be there too. The party has now been ahead in the polls for five months.</p>\n<p>Never before has a party other than Conservative or Labour been ahead in the polls for so long. Indeed, since the party's success in English local elections in May, it has consistently been averaging 30% to 31%, enough to put it well ahead of all its rivals.</p>\n<p>Recent attempts by YouGov and More in Common to estimate what the party's support might mean in terms of MPs suggest that if an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority. At the moment, Nigel Farage - now firmly in place as Reform's leader - appears potentially on course to become the UK's next prime minister.</p>\n<p>The question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?</p>\n<p>The next general election could be almost four years away. Much could happen between now and then. A year into the last parliament the Conservatives were narrowly ahead in the polls – only to crash to a heavy defeat in last summer's election.</p>\n<p>But what could make a difference – one way or the other – to Reform's prospects? Analysis of who is - and who is not - backing the party, and why, provides us with vital clues.</p>\n<p>So too does an understanding of the broader UK political landscape, one in which a fragmentation of the vote away from the main parties is offering Reform an unprecedented opportunity.</p>\n<h2>A plague on both their houses?</h2>\n<p>Support for Reform might be thought to be simply a protest vote by an electorate fed up with slow growth, an ailing health service, and high levels of immigration. If so, the party's popularity would seem likely to wane should the country's prospects look brighter in four years.</p>\n<p>Dissatisfaction with the state of the country certainly underpins support for Reform. For example, according to Ipsos, 68% of voters feel that the economy will get worse over the next year, up from 43% at the time of last year's election and as high as it has ever been a year into a new Parliament. Among those whose current party preference is Reform, a remarkable 89% are pessimistic about the prospects for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the most recent British Social Attitudes survey, conducted last autumn, showed that a record 59% are dissatisfied with the NHS. Among those who voted Reform last year, the figure is even higher – 69%.</p>\n<p>Most voters think that immigration is too high. An Opinium poll in August found that 71% feel that way. But nearly everyone who is now backing Reform (97%) expresses that view.</p>\n<p>Reform supporters have little confidence in the ability of either Labour's leader, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, or the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to address these issues. Most lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to handle the economy, the NHS, and immigration. However, at the same time, on balance their judgement of Badenoch's abilities is a negative one too.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Reform supporters have even less confidence than Conservative supporters in Sir Keir's abilities. At the same time, Reform supporters have less confidence than Labour supporters in Badenoch's capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, 58% of Conservatives lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to turn the economy around – well short of the 76% of Reform supporters who express that view. Meanwhile, 40% of Labour supporters doubt that Badenoch can tackle the economy, less than the 47% figure among Reform supporters.</p>\n<h2>A powerful magnet</h2>\n<p>Reform supporters seem to have lost faith in the ability of either of Britain's two traditional governing parties to address the country's most pressing problems.</p>\n<p>In contrast, they do have confidence in Farage. This is especially so for immigration, but he also scores well on the economy and the NHS.</p>\n<p>Among those currently backing Reform, 84% approve of the job Farage is doing – far higher than the equivalent figure for Sir Keir among Labour supporters (62%) or Badenoch (46%) among Conservatives.</p>\n<p>While Farage is not so widely admired in the wider population, his ratings among voters in general still compare favourably with those of his rivals.</p>\n<p>In Opinium's most recent poll, for example, rather more say they disapprove (40%) than approve (30%) of how Farage is handling his job as Reform leader. But that still means that more approve of the job he is doing than approve of Sir Keir (21%) or Badenoch (16%).</p>\n<p>The Reform leader is proving a powerful magnet that is attracting discontented voters into his party's camp.</p>\n<p>The party's future prospects seemingly rest heavily on Farage remaining its leader. The party might struggle to keep its support if Farage departed the political scene. At the same time, voters might drift away if the country's prospects improve under Labour or if Badenoch can persuade them that she and her party have better solutions than Farage.</p>\n<h2>The Brexit factor</h2>\n<p>Politicians do not talk much about Brexit these days. Yet, Brexit is a major fault line that sharply distinguishes those who do and do not support Reform. The party's support stands at no less than 53% among those who voted Leave in 2016. In contrast, just 11% of those who backed Remain are to be found in the ranks of current Reform supporters.</p>\n<p>But to misquote a former prime minister, Brexit means more than Brexit. Those who voted Leave in 2016 have distinctive views on a range of so-called cultural issues.</p>\n<p>They are especially concerned about immigration, they are doubtful about many equalities policies, and they are more inclined to be sceptical about climate change.</p>\n<p>These views are widely prevalent among those currently inclined to vote for Reform but are often out of kilter with the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>According to the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 81% of those who voted Reform last year believe that migrants have undermined rather than enriched the country's culture. Equally 73% feel that migrants have been bad for the country's economy. These figures are very different from those among voters in general, just 31% of whom believe that migration has undermined Britain's culture, and only 32% feel it has been bad for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 53% of Reform voters believe that attempts to give equal opportunities for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals have \"gone too far\". Some 49% say the same of equal opportunities for black and Asian people, while 71% express that view in the case of transgender people. The equivalent figures among the general public are 33%, 18% and 50% respectively.</p>\n<p>Only 33% of Reform voters believe that climate change is being caused mainly by human activity, far fewer than the 54% figure among the public in general. As many as 25% state that the climate is largely changing as a result of natural processes, a view shared by just 8% of all voters. Reform voters are less supportive than other voters of virtually any measure designed to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Opposition to immigration, equal opportunities policies, and climate change measures feature prominently in Reform's campaigning – which often cites spending on these issues as alleged examples of government waste. Indeed, Reform voters are noticeably less keen on government spending too. Only one in four (25%) believe taxes should be increased in order to spend more on \"health, education and social benefits\", much lower than the 46% of all voters who take that view.</p>\n<p>The party is singing a tune that is widely popular among the many Brexiteers who have been recruited into the ranks of its supporters.</p>\n<p>Doing so has enabled the party to capture much of the coalition of Leave voters that gave Boris Johnson his mandate in 2019 to deliver Brexit. The Conservatives lost one in four of their 2019 supporters to Reform at the last election - and now, on top of that, Badenoch's party has lost another three in 10 of those who were still loyal to the Conservatives last year. In total, that means half of those who voted for Johnson in 2019 are now backing Farage.</p>\n<p>Consequently, support for the Conservatives among 2016 Leave voters (23%) is only a little higher now than among Remain supporters (14%). In 2019, 75% of Leave voters (and just 20% of Remainers) backed Johnson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy853rj2kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He is also wearing a hi-vis vest.\"/>\n    <p>It is going to be a long 12 weeks, critical to the chancellor, the government and the nation's economy.</p>\n    <p>Rachel Reeves chose to talk to me at a Birmingham housebuilding development to launch the Budget process as she tried her hand at some bricklaying.</p>\n    <p>However, the obligatory hard hat might come in rather handy away from the site as the chancellor wanted to get across that the point of her Budget would not just be to \"raise enough money\" for public services - which is code for tax rises.</p>\n    <p>She wants to be known as a reforming chancellor who made much-needed structural reforms to how the tax system operates, in a bid to boost economic productivity and growth to improve living standards.</p>\n    <p>First and foremost, that requires a reassertion that she is in charge of this process.</p>\n    <p>\"I will make the decisions,\" she said, \"in lockstep\" with Number 10.</p>\n    <p>That statement is in a week of economist transfers where the Treasury has become something of a feeder club to Number 10.</p>\n    <p>Off the junior ministers' bench has been Darren Jones, Reeves' former deputy, who has taken up a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce93k7l0zpro\">newly-created role as Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister</a>. </p>\n    <p>Football analogies aside, the immediate challenge facing Reeves is the size of the gap in the public finances.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor chose to dismiss the suggestion of a \"£50bn black hole\", and talk of a need for a visit to the International Monetary Fund to request a bailout.</p>\n    <p>She also savaged some of the Budget speculation over tax rises on property, banks and pensions as not just \"wrong\" but \"irresponsible\".</p>\n    <p>The Treasury says it has not been flying kites over the summer.</p>\n    <p>I also put to her the very interesting words of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in July, on levelling with the public that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending.</p>\n    <p>There was the mildest air of annoyance with the forecaster whose analyses are so critical to the Budget process.</p>\n    <p>\"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce four forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy,\" she replied.</p>\n    <p>While the chancellor has been a massive supporter of the OBR, granting it more independence, this nerdy point could reflect some looming tension over its assessment of her economic policies.</p>\n    <p>Expect some considerable haggling with the OBR from the freshly recruited array of high-powered Downing Street economists.</p>\n    <p>Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules around borrowing, she says.</p>\n    <p>But there will be pressure from her backbenchers to fudge them.</p>\n    <p>What spending reductions could be on the cards? Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.</p>\n    <p>She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8%, down.</p>\n    <p>Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.</p>\n    <p>Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.</p>\n    <p>She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics.</p>\n    <p>It's going to be a rough ride to 26 November.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He is standing outside, with a woman holding a red sign and a large building in the background. He is wearing a dark jacket and shirt. \"/>\n    <p>Sometimes the left of Scottish politics can feel like a crowded place.</p>\n    <p>You have the SNP, Labour and the Scottish Greens all claiming to be the natural home for voters who are that way inclined.</p>\n    <p>And that's before you even get into a variety of smaller parties.</p>\n    <p>And now there's (potentially) a new player on the scene – Jeremy Corbyn's latest project.</p>\n    <p>It's not got a permanent name yet, but it's currently calling itself Your Party. And it's being launched with the support of another former Labour MP, Zarah Sultana.</p>\n    <p>Corbyn has said that he fancies his chances in Scotland.</p>\n    <p>He made that comment on a recent visit to Glasgow, where he joined striking workers on a picket line.</p>\n    <p>There was plenty of enthusiasm there for the former Labour leader.</p>\n    <p>But is there space for this party to make a breakthrough at the Holyrood election next year?</p>\n    <p>That's a difficult assessment to make at this point.</p>\n    <p>We don't have any Scotland specific polling on how Your Party is being received by the public here.</p>\n    <p>A couple of Britain-wide polls have put support for the new project at 6% and 4%.</p>\n    <p>That's hardly a political earthquake, but it does show the party is making some sort of impact.</p>\n    <p>Other polls have produced higher results when the option of \"a new left-wing party\" is included. But this is a slightly vaguer way of phrasing it that pollsters tend to be more sceptical about.</p>\n    <p>What we can't say at this point is how this party could perform in a Holyrood election – we simply don't have the data.</p>\n    <p>The polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice says that research has shown Scotland is slightly more left-wing than England, so perhaps there is scope for a breakthrough?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d28/live/3a746d70-8808-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Ross Greer, a ginger man with glasses, smiles at the camera. He is wearing a blue jacket and white t-shirt. \"/>\n    <p>That's echoed by another pollster, Mark Diffley.</p>\n    <p>He says that Scotland's more proportional voting system for Holyrood means there is potentially a gap for a new \"radical left\" movement.</p>\n    <p>And he points to the Scottish Greens as the party who could be most at risk of leaking votes.</p>\n    <p>Ross Greer, a new co-leader of the Scottish Greens, insists that anyone who wants \"to build a more socialist Scotland is a friend and an ally\".</p>\n    <p>But he adds that he believes his party has the strongest track record of delivering MSPs who fit this mould.</p>\n    <h2>Is Corbyn popular in Scotland?</h2>\n    <p>It is far from certain that Your Party will get any kind of foothold in Scottish politics.</p>\n    <p>Jeremy Corbyn may be a big name, but Mark Diffley says there is little to suggest he has personally captured the imagination of the Scottish electorate.</p>\n    <p>\"He is a figure who doesn't have a history of being particularly popular in Scotland,\" Mr Diffley told BBC Scotland News. \"I don't think he's said much about Scottish politics in the past.\"</p>\n    <p>And while Corbyn had a better than expected result leading Labour in 2017, his share of the vote was much lower in Scotland compared to England and Wales.</p>\n    <p>But there are still some who think this new left party could be what Scottish politics needs.</p>\n    <p>Neil Findlay was a Labour MSP once upon a time. He <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3yp3l175do\">recently left the party</a> over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on benefits.</p>\n    <p>He now runs a public affairs firm that focuses on progressive causes.</p>\n    <p>His West Lothian office walls make his politics clear: there is a quote from the famous Labour left-winger Tony Benn, various bits of trade union paraphernalia and - you guessed it - a Jeremy Corbyn poster.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0c57/live/f678ab50-8806-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A group of people holding Reform signs and banners line up behind a large flag. There man with a Reform sign and a labrador dog with a Reform rosette in the foreground, and a large Reform billboard in the background. \"/>\n    <p>Neil Findlay thinks Your Party could secure backing from more surprising quarters - Reform supporters.</p>\n    <p>The former MSP says that those inclined to back Nigel Farage's party are not necessarily right-wing.</p>\n    <p>He explains that he sees them as frustrated people \"looking for an avenue for their vote because they see the mainstream parties as having let them down\".</p>\n    <p>He is not currently involved with Jeremy Corbyn's new project, but he urged the party to get up and running for the Holyrood election next May, calling this \"the big opportunity\".</p>\n    <p>But does this project not run the risk of splitting the left-wing vote and ultimately making life easier for parties on the right?</p>\n    <p>Mr Findlay says that's an argument deployed by parties \"who are very afraid that their vote is in decline and that some new kid on the block could start to muscle in on their territory\".</p>\n    <h2>The independence question</h2>\n    <p>An obvious question for any new party in Scotland is what stance do they take on independence?</p>\n    <p>Jeremy Corbyn is relaxed about the idea of a second referendum, having recently told BBC Scotland News that if voters want one \"that's fine by me\".</p>\n    <p>But it is not entirely clear if his party is explicitly taking a stance on whether or not it ultimately backs independence.</p>\n    <p>Your Party still has a lot of work to do. After all, it does not even have a final name yet.</p>\n    <p>Some sort of conference to formalise the movement is expected later this year, though the clock is ticking when it comes to next May's Holyrood vote.</p>\n    <p>There could be some sort of space for Jeremy Corbyn's latest party to occupy in Scotland.</p>\n    <p>But if they're to get any sort of foothold in that election, they really have to move fast.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyxpnzzx0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

<p>Zack Polanski has stormed to victory in the Green Party leadership election on a platform promising bold communication and \"eco-populism\".</p>\n    <p>The new leader said he would now \"take the fight to Labour\", telling Sir Keir Starmer's party: \"We are here to replace you.\"</p>\n    <p>While he's made a name for himself as a feisty media performer among the party faithful, he's little known outside the London Assembly, where he is an elected member.</p>\n    <p>Beating two of the party's four MPs to the leadership, the 42-year-old has already faced down the charge that he doesn't have the establishment heft of those elected to Parliament in a first-past-the-post system.</p>\n    <p>His pitch to the membership was to move away from the tried-and-tested, with a decisive shunt to the left and a more confrontational communication style.</p>\n    <p>Polanski has had an unconventional path to politics, previously working as an actor, hypnotherapist and mental health counsellor.</p>\n    <p>A 2013 article in the Sun that still dogs him involved a reporter, who posed as a client, claiming he helped her to boost her bust through the power of thought.</p>\n    <p>Asked about the piece following his win, Polanski said his time as a Harley Street hypnotherapist pre-dated any of his political ambitions and he had immediately apologised.</p>\n    <p>\"We are all more than one mistake,\" he said, adding that Labour was \"terrified\" of his popularity if they were \"rifling through stories from a long time ago where I was clearly misrepresented\".</p>\n    <p>Born in 1982, Polanski grew up in Salford, heading to university in Aberystwyth, in Wales, before ending up in Hackney, east London.</p>\n    <p>He is gay and also Jewish, changing his name from David Paulden when he reached 18 in order to embrace the identity erased by his family's anglicised surname, as well as to differentiate himself from his stepdad, who had the same first name.</p>\n    <p>His first foray into politics was joining the Liberal Democrats, a party he now criticises as being insufficiently left-wing, and standing unsuccessfully for Camden Council and the London Assembly.</p>\n    <p>He joined the Greens in 2017, working as a local party chairman before getting elected to City Hall in 2021 and becoming the party's deputy leader in 2022.</p>\n    <p>As deputy leader, Polanski has played a role in the party's growing electoral success.</p>\n    <p>In last year's general election, the Greens quadrupled their number of MPs to four, with his leadership rivals Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns among those joining Parliament.</p>\n    <p>Caroline Lucas had been the party's sole MP for 14 years, before standing down at last year's election, and she had thrown her weight behind the Ramsay-Chowns joint ticket.</p>\n    <p>While Ramsay and Chowns have been seen as continuity candidates, Polanski wants to move away from the \"stats and spreadsheets\" style, promising a mass-membership \"eco-populist\" movement that connects with voters on an emotional level.</p>\n    <p>Key to that approach is Polanski's approval of Nigel Farage's \"storytelling\" skills, which he told BBC Newsnight could be harnessed to send a different message to a wider audience, including Reform UK supporters.</p>\n    <p>He said the Greens had to \"connect with that anger and turn it to hope, turn it to possible solutions\".</p>\n    <p>In his \"eco-populism\" leadership pitch he has linked the climate crisis to inequality and called for radical action, \"not briefcase politics\", to fix unfair systems.</p>\n    <p>He has promised to lower bills with green energy and nationalised water companies, while also taking the \"fight\" to Labour, particularly on inequality.</p>\n    <p>The battle on inequality includes his longstanding support for a Universal Basic Income, a small, non-means-tested payment for everyone that covers basic needs.</p>\n    <p>As a former property guardian and long-time renter, Polanski has also campaigned for decent, warm homes for everyone.</p>\n    <p>He has called for the government to take action on what he describes as the genocide in Gaza, as well as being arrested for his activism with environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion.</p>\n    <p>His election potentially opens the door to cooperation with the new party <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdeze706jw8o\">being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana</a>.</p>\n    <p>The arrival of a new left-wing party, headed by Corbyn, threatens to take a chunk out of the Green Party's support, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/one-five-britons-would-consider-voting-new-left-wing-party-rising-one-three-young-people-and-labour\">polls suggest</a>. </p>\n    <p>But unlike some in the Greens, Polanski views the new party as an opportunity rather than a threat.</p>\n    <p>He has spoken about forging a new \"Green left\" and of collaborating with Corbyn on policy, although he has stopped short of proposing a formal electoral pact, saying it is \"too soon\".</p>\n    <p>This is a potential headache for Sir Keir, as he battles to hold on to left-wing voters, many of whom had already deserted Labour for the Greens at the last election.</p>\n    <p>Being bold and radical does not come without risk, as Chowns and Ramsay, who were both elected to Parliament in previously Tory areas, had been keen to point out during the campaign.</p>\n    <p>Jettisoning the careful calibration both those MPs managed to balance to win half the party's Westminster seats from the Conservatives could leave them, and the 3,705 Green members who voted for them, out in the cold.</p>\n    <p>Polanski sought to address these concerns in his victory speech, saying: \"To those of you who didn't vote for me, this is a democracy. We don't have to agree on everything. We just have to have common cause.\"</p>\n    <p>But the four Green MPs will now have to elect one of their number to lead their group in the Commons, setting up another potential source of tension.</p>\n    <p>Because of the way the Green Party is structured, with a leadership election every two years, members will get a chance to give their verdict on Polanski's new direction well before the next general election, due in 2029.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Get the latest political analysis and big moments, delivered straight to your inbox every weekday”.

But I am not entirely sure I believe her.</p>\n    <p>Tidball was born with a congenital disability, which affects all four limbs. She has foreshortened arms and legs, with one digit on each hand.</p>\n    <p>When she was a child she missed three years of school because of the critical surgeries she needed.</p>\n    <p>The disability campaigner was elected as Labour MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire last July, and says that while getting into politics is difficult, getting around the Houses of Parliament is hard when you have a disability.</p>\n    <p>As MPs return to Parliament following the summer recess, I took a tour around the building with her.</p>\n    <p>It is not long before we reach a heavy wooden door with one of the round, smooth door handles.</p>\n    <p>\"Within about five months of being here, I had about six conversations with senior people about door handles,\" she tells me.</p>\n    <p>\"And I said if I have to have another conversation about why we need to make the door handles more accessible I will chain myself to them - rather irreverently I might say.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc45/live/4ade32d0-871e-11f0-8539-299a7a7c0d9c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC/James Vincent A woman's hand, with only one digit, on a gold-coloured round doorknob. The doorknob is smooth and shaped like a flower with petals. The door is dark wood with metal decoration over the window and around the doorknob plate. The woman is wearing a dark dress.\"/>\n    <p>A Parliament spokesperson says work is taking place to upgrade access for disabled people and the House of Commons Modernisation Committee is currently looking at how to improve things.</p>\n    <p>But Tidball says there is a long way to go.</p>\n    <p>\"Twenty-two per cent of the voting age population are disabled,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"We absolutely need to make sure that the composition of Parliament reflects those numbers. It makes our politics much more rich.\"</p>\n    <p>As we go up and down sets of stairs and in and out of doors, we talk about how far away the accessible toilets are from some of the committee rooms.</p>\n    <p>And when you get there, you have to push open a heavy door to get into them.</p>\n    <p>I ask Tidball if any of this makes her angry.</p>\n    <p>\"It does make me angry but you know what they say - don't get angry, get organised,\" she says, smiling.</p>\n    <p>\"Ultimately I want to make this place more inclusive for other disabled people who might come through the doors.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d544/live/ac20a320-8732-11f0-9ea1-07d888221746.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC/James Vincent A wide-angled image of a man in a grey suit and a woman in a navy suit stood talking to each other on a mezzanine between two sets of stairs. A large hall on the lower floor, with a high wooden vaulted ceiling and large stained glass window at the far end. A set of stone steps leads up to the first floor on the right hand side. There are two ornate lamps at the top of the steps on either side of an ornate wooden door. Above the door is a stained glass window.\"/>\n    <p>As our footsteps echo across the stone floor tiles and the courtyards of Parliament, I notice we have already done a fair chunk of our recommended 10,000 daily steps.</p>\n    <p>Walking through the buildings is a good way to bump into fellow MPs but you can cover a fair distance.</p>\n    <p>Tidball wants to show me a change that has already been made in the newer Portcullis House - an accessible door.</p>\n    <p>I joke that perhaps it should have a plaque with her name on outside and Tidball laughs as she says it might be a part of her legacy.</p>\n    <p>She is among several disabled MPs who have given evidence to the Modernisation Committee about accessibility.</p>\n    <p>A number reported challenges including concerns about dark spaces in the historic Palace of Westminster, a lack of accessible toilet facilities and unclear signage.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9627/live/6dd3f880-7e7f-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC/James Vincent A lofty stone octagon hall with an intricately tiled floor and ornate vaulted ceiling. Stone statues dotted around the wall. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling. Two ornate stained glass windows either side of arched doorways. A few people can be seen at a distance walking through the hall.\"/>\n    <p>We have been given special permission to walk around certain areas of the Houses of Parliament with Tidball. The scale of the buildings is not often seen by the public.</p>\n    <p>As a political editor, I am supposed to be used to all the statues, vaulted ceilings, and, to be frank, posh surroundings.</p>\n    <p>But I'm not.</p>\n    <p>It instantly strikes me as an amazing slice of history but a very difficult place to navigate if you do not necessarily feel welcome.</p>\n    <p>When we get to Central Lobby we are being looked down upon by statues of former prime ministers as we chat. This is Parliament's meeting place.</p>\n    <p>Members of the Commons and Lords mingle here and technically you can turn up here as a member of the public and ask to see your MP, although you are encouraged to make an appointment.</p>\n    <p>That is of course, if you feel like you can.</p>\n    <p>Fifteen years ago, the government passed the Equality Act in these buildings.</p>\n    <p>The duty to make it easier for disabled people to access public spaces was made law in the room right next to where we are standing.</p>\n    <p>The irony is that room, the Commons Chamber, is still inaccessible to many.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/22ae/live/b519b100-873d-11f0-acd6-23d840edca4d.jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Commons Chamber, a wood-panelled room of rows of green benches facing each other, with a space of floor and a large table in the middle. There is a gallery above the benches with three rows of green benches on it. A large chair at one end of the room. Windows high up in the room and six lights hang on pendants from the ceiling.\"/>\n    <p>These buildings are not easy to modernise.</p>\n    <p>But it is not just the fixtures and fittings that need to be looked at. The archaic ways of Parliament, that some people love, can create barriers for disabled MPs.</p>\n    <p>To get the Speaker's attention during a debate, MPs stand up and sit down, pretty much constantly, to grab his eye.</p>\n    <p>\"Sitting on those green benches is really special, but they were designed for tall men so for me it is a bit of struggle,\" Tidball says.</p>\n    <p>She adds that although she feels \"incredibly lucky\" to be in Parliament, there are other physical challenges to the job.</p>\n    <p>When MPs vote they walk through voting lobbies - either the Aye or the No lobby.</p>\n    <p>\"Its a long old walk, it takes about 15 minutes per vote,\" Tidball says.</p>\n    <p>\"We've done 10 votes in a day before. \"</p>\n    <h2>'Changes are needed'</h2>\n    <p>Tidball wants everyone to feel like they could become an MP and hopes that Parliament can reflect society</p>\n    <p>In terms of it being welcoming for everyone, however, I ask her if it is good enough.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not good enough. That is why we'll continue to work hard to make it better,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"I think we've got the will there to make those changes.\"</p>\n    <p>\"That culture has already changed and the staff have been incredible.</p>\n    <p>\"While I have the privilege of being here, I've got to do what I can to make it easier for the next generation of disabled young people - to make them feel that this space is for them.</p>\n    <p>\"I also want to make sure that constituents, regardless of whether they've got disabilities or not, feel that this is their house too.\"</p>\n    <p>The House of Commons Modernisation Committee is currently looking at how to improve things.</p>\n    <p>An accessible toilet has been installed near the Commons Chamber, as well as improved signage and lighting.</p>\n    <p>A report is due to be published later in the year with plans for bigger changes.</p>\n    <p>Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons and Chair of the Modernisation Committee, said: \"The House of Commons must set an example on accessibility, yet we're repeatedly falling short of what we expect from every other employer in the country.</p>\n    <p>\"No-one can have listened to the evidence we've heard over the past months and not feel compelled to act.\"</p>\n    <p>She said it is \"unacceptable\" that the role of an MP is made harder by the structure of the building and by inaccessible procedures and processes.</p>\n    <p>\"Our inquiry is ongoing, and we'll be setting out a whole host of ambitious recommendations in the autumn, but with these quick and important actions we make this a more workable and welcoming place to all those who use it,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>A Parliament spokesperson said: \"It is vital that Parliament is accessible to all.</p>\n    <p>\"We understand that there is more to be done to ensure that disabled people do not face unnecessary difficulties when working in or visiting Parliament.\"</p>\n    <p>They said Parliament is \"committed to making further essential adjustments\".</p>\n    <p>\"In the meantime, we are getting on with work across the estate to ensure the safety of our colleagues and visitors, as well as supporting the continued business of Parliament,\" they said.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Listen to highlights from </i>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/curation/p0cjdy2n\">South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds</a>\n      <i>, catch up with the latest </i>\n      <i>episode of Look North</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkz1j18g0do?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is a violation of international law for an occupier to settle its citizens on the land it has taken.</p>\n<p>Last year, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory that said the entire occupation was illegal.</p>\n<p>But the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is hungry for more settlements.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, the defence minister Israel Katz and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that 22 new settlements would be built in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Katz said the massive expansion, the biggest in decades, was making a \"strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel and serves as a buffer against our enemies\" .</p>\n<p>\"This is a Zionist, security, and national response - and a clear decision on the future of the country,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Next to Katz was the ultra-nationalist leader Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a settlement in the West Bank and believes that the land was given to the Jews by God. He is finance minister but also is effectively the governor of the West Bank with sweeping powers over planning.</p>\n<p>Smotrich called the settlement expansion a \"once-in-a-generation decision\" and declared: \"Next step sovereignty!\"</p>\n<p>Everyone in Israel, and the Palestinians in the territories, know that when Smotrich and his allies say \"sovereignty\" they mean annexation.</p>\n<p>Smotrich wants all the land for Jews and has openly discussed finding ways of removing Palestinians.</p>\n<h2>'We were very, very scared'</h2>\n<p>On hilltop after hilltop in the West Bank are settlements at different stages of their development, from well-established small towns with mature gardens and schools, to outposts with handful of caravans and a militant population of young settlers who often mix religion with extreme Jewish nationalism, firearms and sometimes deadly aggression towards their Palestinian neighbours.</p>\n<p>Statistics collected by the UN and peace campaigners show that violent settlers have increased attacks on their Palestinian neighbours since the 7 October attacks.</p>\n<p>I went to see how that has affected Taybeh, an entirely Christian village of around 1,500 people.</p>\n<p>It is a quiet place that seems to have many more houses than residents. After nearly six hard decades of Israeli occupation, more Taybeh people have been forced to emigrate than now live in the village.</p>\n<p>Two nights before the visit, settlers entered the village when most people were in bed. They burned Kamal Tayea's car and tried unsuccessfully to get into his new house, part of a pleasant development overlooking acres of olive groves. They daubed the walls with graffiti in Hebrew sprayed with red paint.</p>\n<p>Kamal, a middle-aged man reassessing whether his decision to move his family to the edge of the village was wise, is installing a network of security cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We were very, very scared,\" Kamal said. \"I have children and an old mum. Our lives were threatened, and it was terrifying.\"</p>\n<p>I asked him whether Britain's plan to recognise Palestine would make his life any easier.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so. It's a big step to have a superpower like Britain support us, but on the ground, it does not change much. Israel is not compliant with any international resolutions or laws.</p>\n<p>\"It does not listen to any other country in the whole world.\"</p>\n<h2>'Our roots are here. We can't move'</h2>\n<p>During the next night, Jewish settlers raided neighbouring Palestinian communities, burning cars and spraying graffiti. It is more than just vandalism.</p>\n<p>The settlers want the Palestinians out and, in some places in the occupied territories, have succeeded, forcing Palestinians in remote villages out of their farms and stealing their livestock.</p>\n<p>The Greek Orthodox priest, 74-year-old David Khoury was born in Taybeh. In his church he told me that settlers who have threatened him and other residents are often armed.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, they have guns… they'll use them if we argue with them. They want us out, they want us to leave.\"</p>\n<p>The old priest was defiant.</p>\n<p>\"We are here, since Jesus Christ, 2,000 years. Our roots are here. We can't move. We will not move, even if we die here, we will not move from here… Palestine is inside our blood, how we can live without our blood?\"</p>\n<h2>'If you really seek two states, recognise [both]'</h2>\n<p>It was not many miles to Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank, but I wasn't able to get there in person. Israel's checkpoints can make driving back to Jerusalem slow and difficult, so I reached Husam Zomlot via Zoom. He is the head of the Palestinian delegation to the United Kingdom, effectively their ambassador in London. He is back home for the summer and was delighted by Britain's plan to recognise Palestine.</p>\n<p>\"It is a sign that the UK and with it, the rest of the international community are really serious about the two-state solution. We are no longer in the business of the lip service that has lost us three decades. Actually, if you really seek two states, recognise the two states.\"</p>\n<p>\"We see the recognition as the starting gun to a sprint towards implementing and establishing the state of Palestine and fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\"</p>\n<p>Zomlot was jubilant. It was, he said, a first step, and Britain's decision would make a real difference.</p>\n<p>History is one of the powerful drivers of this conflict. Britain, he added, was atoning at last for the wrongs it had done Palestinians when it was the imperial power here between 1917 and 1948.</p>\n<p>He was referring to the promises made in a short, typewritten letter, dated 2 November 1917, signed by the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of Britain's Jewish community. It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p>\n<p>Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p>\n<p>It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p>\n<p>He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p>\n<p>At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p>\n<p>At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p>\n<p>Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East. He is not in a position to punish us, and it definitely will not bring peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"And it's against justice, history, religion, culture... he's giving a huge reward for Yahya Sinwar [the Hamas leader who led the 7 October attacks and was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year].</p>\n<p>\"Wherever he is in hell today, he sees what Keir Starmer says - and says, 'good partner'.\"</p>\n<p>Back in Taybeh, I had asked a group of leading local citizens who were drinking coffee with the mayor in his office what they thought of the UK's recognition plan.</p>\n<p>One of them, a local businessman, said: \"Thank you Britain. But it's too late.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Top image: Getty Images</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6n0eeqp54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Who is in charge? You might think the answer should be obvious.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\"This government should be walking on water, there should be nothing it can't do,\" a Whitehall insider suggests, given the rows and rows and rows - and yes, rows - of Labour MPs who line up behind the prime minister every Wednesday.</p>\n<p>But, by booting out a small band of backbenchers this week, Sir Keir Starmer's put the question of his authority back on the table.</p>\n<p>Answering the question of who is in charge isn't so simple after all.</p>\n<p>This government has a \"backbench they - and we - are surprised to discover they can't control,\" says one senior official.</p>\n<p>The financial markets are breathing down its neck, with the country's debts sky high, and for good measure, what a No 10 source describes as a \"deep current of instability\" around the world.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's next one-to-one meeting with President Donald Trump is a case in point – who knows what he will or won't say alongside the prime minister on Scottish soil next week?</p>\n<p>No-one in government can be sure how that is going to shake down, although I was very definitively told we will not be seeing Sir Keir swinging a club with his transatlantic pal.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, impossible for any administration to be the master of all it surveys. But convincingly displaying authority, inhabiting its power, is a different task.</p>\n<p>And neither all of Sir Keir's MPs, nor all of the people inside the government are sure it's being met.</p>\n<h2>Backbench bust-ups</h2>\n<p>Let's start with the prime minister kicking out four MPs this week after they had objected to various Labour plans and proposals.</p>\n<p>But if Sir Keir really felt in control of his party, why did he need to bother about a group of MPs that wouldn't even fill a family saloon? And why did he do it, just days before accepting some of the logic of one of those he kicked out, Chris Hinchliff, over tweaks to proposed planning laws?</p>\n<p>Bemused? You wouldn't be the only one.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's allies say he always believed there would have to be repercussions for MPs who plot against the government repeatedly, in part because others are asked to defend decisions that might be unpopular or difficult.</p>\n<p>So after the welfare fiasco, the whips were asked to make a list of those who had been actively trying to organise resistance to government plans, rather than just expressing objections.</p>\n<p>After gathering evidence about MPs' behaviour, those four were then shown the door, at least for now, to exert discipline over the backbenches.</p>\n<p>A senior government figure said: \"You can have as big a majority as you want, but if you have no discipline whatsoever it can get chaotic. You can't get chaotic at a time when the country desperately needs its government to get on with things.\"</p>\n<p>It was a separate decision to suspend Diane Abbott - again, a choice made by Labour HQ who felt it had no choice but to act, interpreting her comments as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwye24vjnn8o\">repeating a claim that Jewish people don't experience racism in the same way as black people.</a></p>\n<p>So, \"behave - or else\", is the message to the rest of the backbenches, just when they are about to leave Westminster.</p>\n<p>But have the moves this week made a difference? One senior MP said: \"A lot of people keep wondering, 'Is Keir beholden to his back benches?' I don't think people are like, 'Oh we're going to rebel if we're unhappy all the time'. But there has to be more respect for MPs who are actually out talking to their constituents.\"</p>\n<p>Another senior Labour figure told me, \"No 10 was completely spooked by what happened over welfare – I don't think backbenchers are running it, but they do have a taste for power.\"</p>\n<h2>Are ministers the masters?</h2>\n<p>Who then, is really in charge, I ask a member of the government. They laugh, and say, \"I don't have an answer\".</p>\n<p>The same question posed to another Whitehall figure: \"There is no way of knowing,\" they respond, suggesting sometimes government, even 12 months in, feels chaotic, with contradictory instructions to officials being given, even on the same day.</p>\n<p>It's no secret, and it's not surprising, that working out how to run a country when you haven't done it before is hard.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of ministers and staffers who will of course say loyally that No 10 is now firmly in control after understandable teething troubles, who are also somewhat fed up with the noises off.</p>\n<p>As one government source reckons, \"a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss\". Another insider believes Whitehall is working much better than before. \"In the first six months they were disappointed in us, and we were disappointed with them\".</p>\n<p>The Spending Review process occupied huge amounts of time and effort across government. Now that is over, it's not just the government's purse strings that have been set, but the political priorities alongside. In theory, as that source suggests, \"they are now starting to get on with the doing\".</p>\n<p>But that optimism is not springing from every source.</p>\n<p>One experienced senior official told me: \"A government is in charge if it has a plan, but if it doesn't, it cedes that. They still don't really have a governing plan, so it feels like the PM is in charge, but it is hard for his writ to be made to work.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, it's clearer now, particularly after the big review of spending, what the government wants to do, but not how they plan to do it.</p>\n<p>Another senior figure said: \"They're busy and exhausted going to meetings with each other, and producing documents that no-one ever reads, and conversations that don't lead to anything and telling each other how difficult it is – they don't inhabit their power.\"</p>\n<p>And there's obvious frustration among the government's own members too, one warning of a passive attitude among some colleagues, who could get to the next election and think only, \"Well, I enjoyed driving around in my ministerial car and having my red box\". There is a feeling, like, \"Oh, we are here just to manage, not to lead and drive, and that's not good enough\".</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, one cabinet minister defended the operation, \"It's only been a year, people focus on the problems, if you look at it in the round we have been very, very effective,\" they told me.</p>\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0mn7gmpplo#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20the%20Off%20Air%20with%20Laura%20K%20newsletter%20to%20get%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%27s%20expert%20insight%20and%20insider%20stories%20every%20week%2C%20emailed%20directly%20to%20you.\">Off Air with Laura K</a> newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n<p>Governments are, of course, never short on helpful advice. As well as No 10's own learning on the job, and plans to improve its operations, like a review of communications across government that is under way, there will be other more formal suggestions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Later in the summer a set of proposals will be published by a think-tank with close links to No 10 and Labour, the Future Governance Forum, that's chaired by the former senior civil servant, Helen MacNamara.</p>\n<p>The review will recommend a new government department, called \"Downing Street\", to give this and future prime ministers a more powerful centre of government so that No 10 can make decisions more quickly, and execute its plans more effectively.</p>\n<p>Government insiders may not have appetite for any big bang changes, although they have pledged themselves on many occasions to \"rewire\" the government.</p>\n<p>The respected Institute for Government already warned this week that big changes were needed if \"ministers were serious\" about their promise to rewire the state, concluding in its own research that Sir Keir's notion of \"mission driven government\" looks \"shaky\", and that government departments had reverted to old habits.</p>\n<p>Moving desks and chairs around Whitehall, whether creating new departments or axing the old, wouldn't exactly make the pulse of the public quicken, but perhaps it ought to be on the agenda for a government that has struggled sometimes to exert its will.</p>\n<h2>The mighty markets</h2>\n<p>If ministers' grip isn't as tight as it might be, and backbenchers aren't calling the shots, there is no doubt there's another huge controlling factor.</p>\n<p>A senior Labour source tells me, \"People like to boil this down to palace politics,\" the jockeying for power between politicians, or the competing beliefs inside the party.</p>\n<p>Surely not, Westminster enjoying a soap opera about the battle for the party's soul?</p>\n<p>But instead they argue, \"The markets are fundamentally a really major part of it – the government isn't making challenging decisions because it enjoys annoying people, or making life hard\".</p>\n<p>It's true the fights inside and outside the government are so often driven by cash sloshing around or falling down the back of the sofa.</p>\n<p>Spoiler, overall spending is enormous but Rachel Reeves keeps a very tight grip on her wallet.</p>\n<p>By instinct, Labour politicians normally want public spending to be generous.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxwe3g4wl5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The fate of President Joe Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n            The justices <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-arguments-takeaways/index.html\">heard arguments on February 28</a> in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\n    </p>\n<p>About 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 – prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.</p>\n<p>\n            The administration <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-launch/index.html\">officially launched the application</a> on October 17, 2022, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            If the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/means-testing-student-loan-forgiveness-what-matters/index.html\">eligible for the debt relief</a>. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded. \n    </p>\n<p>Second, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.</p>\n<p>\n            If a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html\">qualifying borrower</a> also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/pell-grant-student-loan-forgiveness/index.html\">Pell grants</a> are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and <a href=\"https://ticas.org/files/pub_files/students_at_the_greatest_risk_of_default.pdf\">end up in default</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>Here’s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:</p>\n<h2>What are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?</h2>\n<p>The Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.</p>\n<p>\n            One of the lawsuits was brought by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-ruling/index.html\">six Republican-led states</a>, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n    </p>\n<p>A lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.</p>\n<p>\n            The other challenge that the Supreme Court heard<i> </i>was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some. \n    </p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.</p>\n<p>\n            Lawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1528451/download\">memo</a> from<i> </i>the Department of Justice. \n    </p>\n<h2>When will I receive my debt relief?</h2>\n<p>It’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.</p>\n<p>Administration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won’t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.</p>\n<p>\n            On November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/politics/student-loan-payments-pause-ends-october/index.html\">due starting in October</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-payments-debt-ceiling-deal/index.html\">law passed in early June </a>that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\n    </p>\n<p>The White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.</p>\n<p>If and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.</p>\n<p>\n            If the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application\">https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Applicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.</p>\n<p>Borrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.</p>\n<h2>What kind of federal loans are eligible?</h2>\n<p>There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.</p>\n<p>But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>\n            The Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-lawsuit/index.html\">but reversed course last September</a> when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers. \n    </p>\n<p>Defaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.</p>\n<h2>What year is the income threshold based on?</h2>\n<p>\n            If Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income\">adjusted gross income</a> for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n    </p>\n<p>A taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.</p>\n<h2>How will the government know what my income was?</h2>\n<p>The Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.</p>\n<p>Millions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.</p>\n<h2>Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?</h2>\n<p>Borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.</p>\n<p>But it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.</p>\n<h2>I’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.</p>\n<p>\n            Eligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency\">dependent students</a>, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n    </p>\n<h2>I have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.</p>\n<h2>I’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?</h2>\n<p>\n            Yes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent\">Parent PLUS</a> loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n    </p>\n<p>But a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.</p>\n<h2>How do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.</p>\n    <p>In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.</p>\n    <p>Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.</p>\n    <p>Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.</p>\n    <p>\n            Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as <i>Pseudoliparis belyaevi</i> – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.</p>\n    <p>Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.</p>\n    <p>“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/asia/deepest-fish-filmed-off-japan-scn-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/world/climate-warming-emissions-study-intl/index.html\">escalating climate crisis</a> is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Strategy and consulting firm <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/sites/default/files/studies/Simon-Kucher_Global_Sustainability_Study_2021.pdf\">Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021</a> found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            This shift in consumer preferences has propelled <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/business/business-climate-earth-day-roundup/index.html\">many beauty brands to set environmental goals</a>: to move away from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/us/plastic-recycling-climate-impact-lbg/index.html\">single-use and virgin plastics</a>, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.\n    </p>\n<p>However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.</p>\n<h2>Ingredient and branding transparency</h2>\n<p>\n            There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2023/03/13/jessica-alba-honest-company-criticism-wtcw-vpx.cnn\">“greenwashing,”</a> where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Companies often use marketing language like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/clean-beauty-vs-green-beauty\">“clean beauty”</a> to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.\n    </p>\n<p>“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”</p>\n<p>\n            In a <a href=\"https://britishbeautycouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-courage-to-change.pdf\">2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change”</a> their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”\n    </p>\n<p>“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.</p>\n<p>\n            Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/health/makeup-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html\">including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde</a> — it claims to never use in its products.)\n    </p>\n<p>“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”</p>\n<p>“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”</p>\n<p>Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”</p>\n<h2>Unpacking plastics</h2>\n<p>\n            The industry’s plastic packaging is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/energy/single-use-plastics-volume-grows-climate-intl-hnk/index.html\">a particular sustainability challenge</a> — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used <a href=\"https://gc-22.emf.org/ppu/\">144,430 metric tons of plastic</a> in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/environment/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.htm\">only recycles 4% of its plastic waste</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)</p>\n<p>“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.</p>\n<p>However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.</p>\n<p>Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.</p>\n<p>“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”</p>\n<h2>The weight of retail</h2>\n<p>Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.</p>\n<p>\n            “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/beauty-brand-recycling-programs\">Smaller businesses do more</a>, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Sephora launched its “<a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/eco-friendly-beauty\">Clean + Planet Positive</a>” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/economy/climate-change-inflation-food-energy-prices/index.html\">throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping</a>, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with. \n    </p>\n<h2>The missing player</h2>\n<p>\n            The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/\">B Corporation, or B Corp</a>. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/how-to-shop-big-box-retailers-vs-brands-sustainably\">eco-conscious consumers</a>, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.\n    </p>\n<p>Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.</p>\n<p>Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.</p>\n<p>“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.</p>\n<p>\n            And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency <a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/cosmetics-prohibited-substances?p_p_id=eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByCol=fld_erc2_appname&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_substance_identifier_field_key=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_delta=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByType=asc&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_doSearch=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_deltaParamValue=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_resetCur=false&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_cur=3\"> lists 2,495 substances</a> banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/prohibited-restricted-ingredients-cosmetics\">only lists 11</a>, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/does-europe-have-better-sunscreens/#.Wl-GvpM-d-U\">lab tests of 51 sunscreen products</a> in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard. \n    </p>\n<p>However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.</p>\n<p>“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.</p>\n    <p>Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.</p>\n    <p>“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”</p>\n    <p>Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.</p>\n    <p>The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.</p>\n    <p>Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.</p>\n    <p>Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.</p>\n    <p>The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.</p>\n    <p>The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.</p>\n    <h2>‘Investing in your future’</h2>\n    <p>Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.</p>\n    <p>\n            At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/world/syria-refugee-crisis-when-war-displaces-half-a-country/index.html\">by late 2015</a> – about half of Syria’s pre-war population. \n    </p>\n    <p>Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.</p>\n    <p>While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.</p>\n    <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.</p>\n    <p>\n            The move sparked a backlash in Germany and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/06/europe/angela-merkel-migration-germany-intl/index.html\">the sudden growth</a> of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.\n    </p>\n    <p>Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”</p>\n    <p>For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.</p>\n    <p>Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/europe/germany-mayor-syrian-refugee-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/t-magazine/kwame-brathwaite-photographer.html\">T Magazine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5973va/kwame-braithwaites-breathtaking-photos-shaped-the-black-is-beautiful-movement\">Vice</a>, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404135409-03-kwame-brathwaite-obituary-models.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Brathwaite's photograph of models who embraced their natural hair, photographed in 1966.\"/>\n    <p>Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.</p>\n    <p>\n            “You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told <a href=\"https://aperture.org/from-the-archive/kwame-brathwaite-black-is-beautiful/\">Aperture Magazine</a> in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”\n    </p>\n    <p>By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404135404-02-kwame-brathwaite-obituary-car.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Women in a car gathered for Garvey Day, the annual event commemorating Black activist Marcus Garvey.\"/>\n    <p>By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.</p>\n    <p>\n            Throughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/an-artists-ornate-natural-hair-styles-through-the-eyes-of-a-legendary-photographer-of-black-beauty\">The New Yorker</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.</p>\n    <p>\n            The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/opec-production-cuts/index.html\"> cut oil production</a> by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday. \n    </p>\n    <p>The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.</p>\n    <p>“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”</p>\n    <p>The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.</p>\n    <p>“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.</p>\n    <p>\n            The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html\">record $5.02 a gallon on June 14</a>, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/energy/gas-prices-rise/index.html\">average price fell every day</a>. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/strategic-petroleum-reserve-joe-biden/index.html\">US Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a>, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline. \n    </p>\n    <p>Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.</p>\n    <p>“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.</p>\n    <p>However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.</p>\n    <p>\n            This week, sees the publication of “<a href=\"https://www.newbig5.com/\">The New Big 5</a>” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/climate-change-photography-paul-nicklen-cristina-mittermeier-c2e-spc-intl-scn-climate/index.html\">Paul Nicklen</a>, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/africa/jane-goodall-conservation/index.html\">Jane Goodall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/opinions/paula-kahumbu-africa-wildlife-filmmakers-c2e-spc-intl/index.html\">Paula Kahumbu</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230330162944-the-new-big-5-graeme-green.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"British photographer Graeme Green is the founder of the New Big 5 project, an international conservation initiative supported by photographers, conservationists and wildlife charities.\"/>\n    <h2>Animals at risk</h2>\n    <p>Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”</p>\n    <p>In total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.</p>\n    <p>“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404101434-new-big-5-cover.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;The New Big 5: A Global Photography Project For Endangered Wildlife&quot; by Graeme Green is out now.\"/>\n    <p>\n            According to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/\">UN</a>, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green. \n    </p>\n    <p>As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.</p>\n    <p>A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403092410-the-new-big-5-tiger-thomas-vijayan-story-card.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;In Indian forests, it's very difficult to get a proper picture of a running tiger, as they all are thick forests. I kept the camera settings fast enough to freeze the running tiger,&quot; said photographer Thomas Vijayan in a press release.\"/>\n    <p>Jane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.</p>\n    <p>“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>“The New Big 5: A Global Photography Project For Endangered Wildlife,” by Graeme Green, published by Earth Aware Editions, is on sale from April 4, 2023.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n  <i>This story has been updated to reflect the range of issues covered by the book.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/new-big-5-wildlife-photography-book-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.</p>\n    <p>The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.</p>\n    <p>This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector.

The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.</p>\n    <p>Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.</p>\n    <p>A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.</p>\n    <p>Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.</p>\n    <p>“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194318-02-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.\"/>\n    <h2>Rising pressure</h2>\n    <p>\n            The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/kevin-mccarthy-taiwan-president-meeting-china/index.html\">announced</a> earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication<strong> </strong>amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\">suspected Chinese surveillance balloon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/us-sanctions-chips-china-xi-tech-ambitions-intl-hnk/index.html\">semiconductor supply chains</a> – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n    </p>\n    <p>Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.</p>\n    <p>But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.</p>\n    <p>For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.</p>\n    <p>China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.</p>\n    <p>The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”</p>\n    <p>It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.</p>\n    <p>While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.</p>\n    <p>Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.</p>\n    <p>Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.</p>\n    <p>Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194350-03-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency.\"/>\n    <h2>Beijing watching</h2>\n    <p>A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>\n            Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-public-opinion-military-response-pelosi-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric</a> in mainland China. \n    </p>\n    <p>This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.</p>\n    <p>But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.</p>\n    <p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.</p>\n    <p>\n            It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/asia/taiwan-former-president-ma-visit-china-intl-hnk/index.html\">Ma Ying-jeou</a>, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n    </p>\n    <p>Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.</p>\n    <p>\n            China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/china/taiwan-ukraine-parallels-china-russia-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">global spotlight</a> following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Beijing has recently sought to position itself as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/china/china-position-political-settlement-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">an agent of peace</a> in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n    </p>\n    <p>This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.</p>\n    <p>\n            An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/biden-xi-meeting-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/h_93dc31c74b4bfe3b5ab35a8c0bb23901\">face-to-face meeting</a> in Bali. \n    </p>\n    <p>“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p>\n    <p>“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220819143103-china-amb-nicholas-burns-vpx.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"China Amb Nicholas Burns vpx\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed reporting.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment. \n    </p>\n    <p>Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.</p>\n    <p>Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.</p>\n    <p>He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/victor-j-glover/biography\">Glover</a> is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/02/tech/nasa-spacex-astronauts-return-iss-highlights-scn/index.html\">piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft</a> and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n    </p>\n    <p>“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.</p>\n    <p>Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/christina-hammock-koch/biography/\">Koch</a>, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/world/nasa-all-female-spacewalk-koch-meir-scn-trnd/index.html\">first all-female spacewalk in 2019</a>. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\n    </p>\n    <h2>About this mission</h2>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/world/nasa-splashdown-artemis-i-orion-sunday-scn/index.html\">uncrewed test mission</a> that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120057-artemis-ii-crew-official-portrait.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The Artemis II lunar flyby mission crew members include (from left): NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman (foreground) and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\"/>\n    <p>If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n    <p>The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.</p>\n    <p>The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.</p>\n    <p>After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n    <p>Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/world/nasa-spacesuits-moon-artemis-unveil-scn/index.html\">spacesuits</a> for walking on the moon and a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/business/spacex-static-fire-starship-super-heavy-scn/index.html\">lunar lander</a> to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            NASA is targeting a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis-iii/\">2025 launch date</a> for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf\">2026 or later</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.</p>\n    <h2>Picking the astronauts</h2>\n    <p>\n            Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/world/nasa-artemis-moon-secretive-crew-selection-process/index.html\">selection process</a>. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/astronaut-right-stuff-apollo-11-trnd-scn/index.html\">inaugural missions</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.</p>\n    <p>“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”</p>\n    <p>She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”</p>\n    <p>“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.</p>\n    <p>\n  <i>CNN’s Kristin Fisher contributed to this story.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-056594/190525/Prevalence-and-Disparities-in-the-Detection-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext?autologincheck=redirected\">One study </a>published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7011a1.htm\">A 2021 report </a>found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/health/autism-diagnosis-cdc-report/index.html\">more doctors screening</a> for the condition.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Lithium is an <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/3/lithium\">alkali metal</a> that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/lithium-us-groundwater\">according to the US Geological Survey.</a> \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2803171?guestAccessKey=9a8969db-b1bb-4260-a0c8-77cc4bfca160&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=040323\">new study,</a> published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.</p>\n    <p>\n            As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD<strong> </strong>diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.</p>\n    <p>Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.</p>\n    <p>Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p>\n    <p>“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.</p>\n    <p>\n            The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710473/\">health benefits</a> such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.\n    </p>\n    <p>“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”</p>\n    <p>Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n    <p>“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP9509#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20air,been%20mostly%20limited%20by%20trimesters.\">air pollution</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7011a1.htm\">phthalates</a>. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://form.cnn.com/results_are_in?source=article\">Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    </p>\n    <p>A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.</p>\n    <p>“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/autism-lithium-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.</p>\n    <p>“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”</p>\n    <p>A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Instagrammable</i> is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.\n    </p>\n    <p>Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).</p>\n    <p>Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.</p>\n    <p>“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.</p>\n    <h2>Spice and texture</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329092523-02-inside-haggis-with-turnips.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Haggis is traditionally served with turnips.\"/>\n    <p>For children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.</p>\n    <p>Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.</p>\n    <p>“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”</p>\n    <p>“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”</p>\n    <p>Lawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.</p>\n    <p>Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.</p>\n    <p>Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.</p>\n    <h2>Wild wee beastie</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329092534-03-inside-haggis-chip-shop.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Deep-fried haggis is often a staple of Scottish fish and chip shops. \"/>\n    <p>In neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.</p>\n    <p>Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.</p>\n    <p>But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.</p>\n    <p>It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329100500-05-inside-haggis.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Imports of Scottish haggis are banned from the United States. \"/>\n    <p>From such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.</p>\n    <p>Bourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.</p>\n    <p>Across the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.</p>\n    <h2>Pudding chieftan</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329173530-inside-haggis-burns-night-recrop-1.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The haggis is toasted on Burns Night, held every year in honor of Scottish poet Robert Burns.\"/>\n    <p>Firmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.</p>\n    <p>In comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.</p>\n    <p>As the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>The trembling earth resounds his tread/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Clap in his ample fist a blade/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>He’ll make it whistle/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>And legs and arms and heads will cut/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Off like the heads of thistles</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>These days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.</p>\n    <p>For Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.</p>\n    <p>“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.</p>\n    <p>“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”</p>\n    <h2>Haggis pakora</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329100506-06-inside-haggis-fine-dining.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Haggis can often be found on fine dining menus.\"/>\n    <p>Its texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n            Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">previously announced purge</a> by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major<strong> </strong>publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Twitter had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">said</a> it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/twitter-verified-checkmarks/index.html\">join the platform’s Twitter Blue</a> subscription service, which has allowed<strong> </strong>accounts to pay for verification since December.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared,<strong> </strong>but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/media/news-organizations-elon-musk-twitter-checkmark/index.html\">previously told CNN</a> it would not pay for verification.  \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642383150230773760?s=20\">tweet</a> saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/business/elon-musk-twitter-ban-reverse-conditions/index.html#:~:text=Musk%20had%20on%20Thursday%20banned,The%20Washington%20Post\"s%20Drew%20Harwell.\">slamming journalists</a> or media outlets — in a series of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642395451209940993?s=20\">tweets</a> that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”  \n    </p>\n    <p>The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.</p>\n    <p>Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.</p>\n    <p>Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n    <p>In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.</p>\n    <h2>Musk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks</h2>\n    <p>Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.</p>\n    <p>\n            In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/tech/twitter-impersonators-paid-verification/index.html\">impersonators</a>, and was relaunched in December. \n    </p>\n    <p>Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.</p>\n    <p>\n            In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t,<strong> </strong>prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">pushed back</a> against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/elon-musk-twitter-verification-plans/index.html\">said it’s not clear</a> that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.  \n    </p>\n    <p>Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”</p>\n    <p>“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.</p>\n    <p>\n            Musk last week also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/tech/elon-musk-verified-only-for-you-feed/index.html\">said</a> that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>–CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.</i> \n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/tech/twitter-blue-checks/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.</p>\n    <p>Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009. Along with Mabel, the couple also have an 8-year-old daughter, Evelyn. Willis also has daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.</p>\n    <p>Willis is clearly a doting dad.

Sharing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cp_EC-ru8MP/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\">a video montage on Instagram</a>, she referred to the actor as “pure love.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            In February, Willis’ family announced that his <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/02/16/entertainment/bruce-willis-dementia/index.html\">speaking disorder, aphasia, had progressed into a form of dementia </a>called frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.\n    </p>\n    <p>“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead,” they said in an update shared online. “As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”</p>\n    <p>According to the Alzheimer’s Association, FTD refers to “a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain’s frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes.” These areas of the brain are generally associated with personality, behavior and language.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/entertainment/emma-willis-mabel-birthday-photos-intl-scli/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050\">spoke </a>at a white nationalist event organized by Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes that caused <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-leaders-denounce-greene-gosar-speaking-white-nationalist-event-rcna18050\">Republican leaders to denounce her</a>. \n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140926161644-dean-obeidallah-profile-image.jpg?q=w_256,c_fill\" alt=\"Dean Obeidallah\"/>\n    <p>\n            Last week, Greene’s Twitter account was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/twitter-cites-rules-against-violent-speech-in-restricting-marjorie-taylor-greenes-account/4191150/\">temporarily suspended</a> by the Elon Musk-headed platform over a tweet with <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-twitter-account-nashville-school-shooting-vengeance-post/\">a graphic referring to a “Trans Day of Vengeance,”</a> as she denounced <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/marjorie-taylor-greenes-twitter-feed-suspended-over-anti-trans-tweets/\">a planned transgender rights rally</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            And come Tuesday, Greene <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1642548632749502465?s=20\">has announced plans</a> to protest in New York City when former President Donald Trump is expected to be arraigned on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/31/politics/trump-indictment-what-to-know/index.html\">an indictment of more than 30 counts</a>, calling the proceedings against him an “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1641793406539030528\">unconstitutional WITCH HUNT!</a>” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But on Sunday, Greene was featured on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview the long-running show promoted on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1641863327415410691?s=20\">with the tease</a>: “Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, nicknamed MTG, isn’t afraid to share her opinions, no matter how intense and in-your-face they are. She sits down with Lesley Stahl this Sunday on 60 Minutes.” The images attached to this tweet by “60 Minutes” include Greene and Stahl walking through the US Capitol, taking a stroll outside and Greene showing Stahl something on her phone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            In the segment that aired Sunday night, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-far-right-republican-transcript-60-minutes-2023-04-02/\">Stahl noted the congresswoman</a> had moved from the fringe to the GOP’s front row in two years despite a “sharp tongue” and “some pretty radical views” as well as “over the top” comments such as “the Democrats are a party of pedophiles.” Stahl also referred to video of Greene chasing a Parkland, Florida, school shooting survivor, still maintaining that the 2020 election was stolen and failing to criticize Trump over spending. (The interview was conducted before news of his indictment.)\n    </p>\n    <p>But Stahl didn’t mention Greene spoke at a white nationalist event a year ago while a member of Congress or her extreme anti-Muslim views and her defense of January 6 rioters.</p>\n    <p>\n            Criticism of CBS for amplifying Greene has been <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/critics-pounce-on-60-minutes-interview-with-in-your-face-marjorie-taylor-greene-what-a-fall-from-grace/\">swift and well-deserved</a> even before the program aired.

And in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html\">Greene appeared on video </a>confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html\">social media</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1642173628048367616?s=20\">Greene’s own tweet </a>promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism.

These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUn3XkGZVg\">Timothy McVeigh</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/mcveigh/profile.html\">1995 terrorist attack </a>left 168 dead, including 19 children.

(CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/\">comments</a> of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/\">Moonves added</a>, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry.

The group is performing well as a whole.”</p>\n    <p>Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120210-01-hsbc-shareholders-040323-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, left, and Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, departing following the bank's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.\"/>\n    <p>\n            Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/investing/dividends-coronavirus-recession/index.html\">scrapping its dividend</a> in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.</p>\n    <p>“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.</p>\n    <p>“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/investing/hsbc-stock-earnings-2021-intl-hnk/index.html\">bringing back its dividend</a> in 2021, albeit at a lower level.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403082458-hsbc-hong-kong-file-2022-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"An HSBC bank branch in Hong Kong last July. HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors' portfolios in the city, which is also its top market.\"/>\n    <p>Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.</p>\n    <p>The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.</p>\n    <p>Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”</p>\n    <p>His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.</p>\n    <h2>The Ping An question</h2>\n    <p>HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.</p>\n    <p>\n            Ping An\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PNGAY&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (PNGAY)</a>, China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            In a series of <a href=\"https://group.pingan.com/media/news/2022/Ping-An-Asset-Management--HSBC-advised-to-carefully-study-proposals-to-improve-operating-performance-and-enhance-value.html\">remarks</a> made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.” \n    </p>\n    <p>Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n    <p>The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.</p>\n    <p>The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.</p>\n    <h2>Banking sector turmoil</h2>\n    <p>\n            HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/investing/svb-uk-business-deal-intl-hnk/index.html\">scooped up</a> the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.\n    </p>\n    <p>Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.</p>\n    <p>“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.</p>\n    <p>Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.</p>\n    <p>Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.</p>\n    <p>“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.</p>\n    <p>But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/business/hsbc-spin-off-hk-shareholder-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/11/sonnenfeld-russia-ukraine-corporations/\">vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility</a> who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said. \n    </p>\n    <p>Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>This interview has been edited for clarity and length. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: </strong>Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism? \n    </p>\n    <p>The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.</p>\n    <p>The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Yeah, they’re frustrated.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.</p>\n    <h2>Tesla sales again fall short of production</h2>\n    <p>\n            <i>By CNN’s Chris Isidore </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Tesla <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/investing/tesla-sales?utm_source=business_ribbon\">reported. </a> a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.\n    </p>\n    <p>The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.</p>\n    <p>Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n    <p>But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.</p>\n    <p>“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His research interprets osteological and material culture remains alongside historic texts to examine changing human-animal relationships in Europe and North America over the past 500 years. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/opinions\">opinion</a> on CNN.\n</p>\n    <p>Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.</p>\n    <p>But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122521-03-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_256,c_fill\" alt=\"Eric Tourigny\"/>\n    <p>\n            The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">country’s first public pet cemetery.</a> Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">50% of families own a pet.</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            How did a city that is <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">home to 180,000 dogs</a> not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.com/20230314/barcelona-to-be-first-city-in-spain-to-create-a-public-pet-cemetery/\">according to</a> Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UvjZDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=human+and+animal+space+in+historic+pet+cemeteries+in+london+new+york+and+paris&amp;ots=5DyRzv-Zg6&amp;sig=VwfcnzIu98xlWlqi8eVWtpMN4kw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20and%20animal%20space%20in%20historic%20pet%20cemeteries%20in%20london%20new%20york%20and%20paris&amp;f=false\">since the late 19th century.</a> Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A grave discovery</h2>\n    <p>I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.</p>\n    <p>This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.</p>\n    <p>This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122425-02-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;Darling Sammie,&quot; reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks.\"/>\n    <p>This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.</p>\n    <p>Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.</p>\n    <p>The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.</p>\n    <h2>A member of the family</h2>\n    <p>Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.</p>\n    <p>\n            My <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2020.191\">study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain</a> from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.\n    </p>\n    <p>By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”</p>\n    <p>Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”</p>\n    <p>I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.</p>\n    <p>\n            Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/nyregion/new-york-burial-plots-will-now-allow-four-legged-companions.html\">co-burial of cremated animals and people</a>, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Modern mourning</h2>\n    <p>For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.</p>\n    <p>The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.</p>\n    <p>\n            The RSPCA reassures the public <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/bereavement\">on its website</a> that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the <a href=\"https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet-bereavement-and-pet-loss\">Blue Cross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rainbowsbridge.com/grief_support_center/grief_support_home.htm\">Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center</a> offer counseling to bereaved humans.\n    </p>\n    <p>Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.</p>\n    <p>At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.</p>\n    <p>\n            This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and <a href=\"https://www.virtualpetcemetery.org/pet/index.html\">digital pet cemeteries</a> also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.\n    </p>\n    <p>Whether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief – and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/opinions/pet-cemeteries-burying-animals-history-tourigny/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n            Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/health/mucosal-immunity-covid-19/index.html\">virus gets its first foothold</a> in the body.\n    </p>\n    <p>In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.</p>\n    <p>Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.</p>\n    <h2>Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines</h2>\n    <p>The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.</p>\n    <p>As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.</p>\n    <p>Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.</p>\n    <p>One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.</p>\n    <p>It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.</p>\n    <p>The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.</p>\n    <p>“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.</p>\n    <p>The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.</p>\n    <p>The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.</p>\n    <p>“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <h2>Promising results in animal studies</h2>\n    <p>\n            In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nmicrobiol/\">Nature Microbiology</a>, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.</p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.</p>\n    <p>As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.</p>\n    <p>“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.</p>\n    <p>The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.</p>\n    <p>It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.</p>\n    <p>In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.</p>\n    <h2>More on the way</h2>\n    <p>\n            At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines\">according t</a>o the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.  \n    </p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.</p>\n    <p>Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.</p>\n    <p>One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.</p>\n    <p>The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.</p>\n    <p>“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.</p>\n    <p>FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.</p>\n    <h3>Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://form.cnn.com/results_are_in?source=article\">Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    </p>\n    <p>Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.</p>\n    <p>Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.</p>\n    <p>“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.</p>\n    <p>“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”</p>\n    <p>Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.</p>\n    <p>Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.</p>\n    <p>But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230327154938-06-israel-protests-0327.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Israelis protest during a demonstration after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Jerusalem, on March 27, 2023. \"/>\n    <p>\n            Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.” <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans.

He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.</p>\n    <p>“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country.

    "body": "<p>\n    <strong>Editor’s Note: </strong><i>A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. </i><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/newsletters/meanwhile-in-middle-east\"> Sign up here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n            Turkey’s persecuted <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/world/2015/06/09/intv-amanpour-selahattin-demirtas-coalition.cnn\">pro-Kurdish party</a> has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/01/27/middleeast/turkey-elections-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.  \n    </p>\n<p>In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.</p>\n<p>\n            “We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HDPenglish/status/1638870402364747776\">statement on March 23</a>. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.” \n    </p>\n<p>\n            It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/07/22/exp-ctw-selahattin-demirtas.cnn\">Selahattin Demirtas</a> has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Kemal Kilicdaroglu</a>, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media. \n    </p>\n<p>Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.</p>\n<p>“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”</p>\n<p>\n            Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">an ethnic minority</a> from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.  \n    </p>\n<p>The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.</p>\n<p>But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.</p>\n<p>Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.</p>\n<h2>Precarious position</h2>\n<p>The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.</p>\n<p>If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.</p>\n<p>“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.</p>\n<p>“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”</p>\n<p>The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”</p>\n<p>Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.</p>\n<p>Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.</p>\n<p>The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p>A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”</p>\n<p>Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>The digest </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            <strong>Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’ </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/middleeast/women-arrested-hijab-yogurt-iran-intl/index.html\">Two women were arrested</a> in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/04/03/man-throws-yogurt-on-women-iran-president-raisi-hijab-is-law-nada-bashir-ovn-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn\">showed footage of the man</a>approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters</i>: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/opec-production-cuts/index.html\">Oil prices spiked Monday</a> after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters:</i>The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond  </strong> \n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/kurdish-kingmaker-turkish-elections-mime-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.</p>\n    <p>Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.</p>\n    <p>A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”</p>\n    <p>\n            The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/spy-balloon-technology/index.html\">officials have said</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-balloon-tracking-method/index.html\">developed a method of tracking</a> what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n    </p>\n    <p>The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.</p>\n    <p>\n            CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-spy-balloon-collected-intelligence-us-military-bases-rcna77155\">first to report</a> on the new intelligence.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/politics/china-spy-balloon-us-latest/index.html\">eventually shot down</a> by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n    </p>\n    <p>A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”</p>\n    <p>Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”</p>\n    <p>The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/politics/us-tracking-china-spy-balloon/index.html\">reported</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe.

Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.</p>\n    <p>Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.</p>\n    <p>Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>\n            France is currently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/europe/france-pension-reform-protests-biarritz-airport-intl/index.html\">in the throes of a political and social crisis</a> triggered by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/macron-france-pension-no-confidence-intl/index.html\">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.</p>\n    <p>French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.</p>\n    <p>“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”</p>\n    <p>French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”</p>\n    <p>“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The Biden administration managed to rack up a long list of major legislative wins in its first two years despite facing one of the most closely-divided Congresses in history.<br/>From bipartisan action on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html\">infrastructure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/senate-bipartisan-gun-bill/index.html\">gun safety</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html\">same-sex marriage</a> to party-line bills tackling <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/senate-democrats-climate-health-care-bill-vote/index.html\">climate change and expanding health care coverage</a>, it’s a record President Joe Biden and Democrats on the ballot were all eager to tout on the campaign trail during the midterms. \n    </p>\n<p>But far from the spotlight is a woman who helped make all that happen: Louisa Terrell.</p>\n<p>As the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, Terrell, 53, leads a team that is the president’s collective eyes and ears in Congress.</p>\n<p>“Making sure we’re responding, making sure we’re being proactive, figuring out what’s happening here in this building,” Terrell told CNN, explaining her job while standing in front of the Capitol, where she spends a considerable amount of time even though she works for the White House.</p>\n<p>She describes her role as a conductor for moving Biden’s agenda through Congress.</p>\n<p>“You want to be talking to committees, caucuses. Who’s talking to leadership? Who are the up-and-comers? What’s the floor action? What’s running quickly? What’s slowing down? And you need all these sort of tentacles out there, and then bringing that back every day.”</p>\n<p>But unlike an actual conductor who is front and center of an orchestra, Terrell operates very much behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>In fact, when we sat down for our conversation in the White House Executive Office Building, she said it was her first television interview – ever.</p>\n<p>Terrell’s years of experience in Washington have been critical to her success. She first started on the Hill over 20 years ago as a staffer for then-Sen. Biden on the Judiciary Committee. Looking back, she describes herself at the time as being just a “gal from Delaware,” in awe of the experienced legal clerks and seasoned staffers surrounding her. She quickly found her footing and thrived, going on to serve as Biden’s deputy chief of staff and later worked in the Obama administration’s Office of Legal Affairs – the very team she now leads.</p>\n<p>Even with her expansive resume, however, Terrell readily admits that today’s Washington is tougher to navigate than the one she first arrived in two decades ago.</p>\n<p>“The extremes have gotten extreme and I think that makes it harder,” she said. “You have to really work a lot harder to find where you can meet in the middle.”</p>\n<p>Being able to call on the personal relationships she’s forged over the years on Capitol Hill proved critical to working across the aisle to find that middle ground, particularly given Democrats’ razor-thin majorities.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be very clear on what the president’s position is and why we want to see what we want to see done,” she said of her conversations with Republican lawmakers. “Republicans know that when this White House – and whether it’s us on our team or a senior official – gives the word, then we stand by our word. And I think that kind of credibility on the Hill has been very important to move things.”</p>\n<p>Deep relationships matter too, she said.</p>\n<p>“You get fuel from the other people you work with. And I get an incredible amount of fuel from the senior team here at the White House and just people who have years and years of experience and relationships in those matters.”</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of work that can make or break a president, and even though it’s largely unheralded, that doesn’t mean it goes unnoticed. Following her confirmation to the Supreme Court as its first Black justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson included Terrell in her shout-outs as one of the “brilliant folks” who helped make the historic achievement possible.</p>\n<h2>A lifelong Biden connection</h2>\n<p>Terrell’s longest relationship in the White House is with the president himself. Though their professional relationship started when she came to Washington two decades ago, she first met Biden when she was just 5 years old.</p>\n<p>“I met Beau Biden in kindergarten,” Terrell, who is from Wilmington, recalled with a smile. “It (was) a very quick bike ride from my house to where Beau grew up. So we were childhood friends (and) stayed friends for … all our adulthood.”</p>\n<p>She remembers visiting the Biden household as a kid, sharing with CNN a running joke from her childhood.</p>\n<p>“When we would go to Beau’s house, there was a fax machine in the living room and all you needed to know (was), do not screw up the fax machine,” she says with a laugh. “And again, this is Delaware and it was probably the first fax machine in Delaware, this is high tech equipment.”</p>\n<p>Terrell’s lifelong relationship with the Biden family means she brings a unique perspective to her work in the White House.</p>\n<p>“He knows my folks and just being connected that way,” she said. “You know where the person came from and I think that helps.”</p>\n<p>“It brings a warmth to the work and I feel very, very lucky about that,” she added.</p>\n<p>\n            Terrell said her friend Beau, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/obit-vice-president-son-beau-biden/index.html\">died of a brain tumor in 2015</a>, is always on her mind.\n    </p>\n<p>“You want to represent what … the President wants you to do,” she said. “And then there’s always this other question of, what would Beau do? And I think of those things as kind of intertwined and they’re part of the background driver of how we do the work.”</p>\n<h2>Paying it forward for women</h2>\n<p>Two years into her work on the Judiciary Committee, Terrell became pregnant. She says Biden’s office maintained a family-first culture. But as she continued her career in Washington, her kids got a bit older, and the balancing act became more complicated.</p>\n<p>“I had the job in the Obama administration when my kids were say, like, around 6 and 8 – or 4 and 6. It’s all a little bit of a blur,” she joked.</p>\n<p>She describes her time after work as “bed, bath and beyond,” an entire “second shift” after a full day at the office. It’s something she’s extra mindful of now, as a senior woman in the administration.</p>\n<p>“I look across the White House, the women whose kids are that age, and you really have to (remember) how long their days and their nights are,” Terrell said. “And then to think about the kind of performance and the kind of 100% they’re giving at the office every day. I have so much gratitude and admiration.”</p>\n<p>Women having a seat at the table is not just a phrase in Terrell’s office. When CNN stopped by one of her team meetings in the West Wing, the room was packed with young staffers – mostly women. Terrell says that was a conscious decision, not because of their gender, but because they were the best for the job.</p>\n<p>“(The) expectation is, be ready to contribute. And that’s kind of what I mean – be prepared and ready to play,” she said of the more junior staff. “Don’t be afraid to do that.”</p>\n<p>But when asked what advice she would give to young women starting out in government today, Terrell didn’t hesitate.</p>\n<p>“I think that women today are way braver than I was,” she said. “It’s really impressive. So, I kind of think they don’t need my advice, actually, so, yeah, they don’t need me. I’m just happy to have drinks and coffee with them when they’ll take me,” she said with a laugh.</p>\n<h2>New challenges ahead</h2>\n<p>Terrell and her team are knee-deep in negotiations for the final weeks of a Democratic House majority, which means competing priorities for the rest of the lame duck session – the most important of which is Congress’ basic function of funding the government.</p>\n<p>As some Democrats tried to squeeze in legislation to regulate social media companies, Terrell’s stint at Facebook raised some questions among some advocacy groups, though Terrell maintains her stint at the tech giant 10 years ago doesn’t conflict with the president’s legislative agenda.</p>\n<p>“I think the president kind of came into office and campaigned on this about a very pro-competition, pro-accountability and pro-transparency in social media platforms, which obviously, what they are today is not what they were 10 years ago. So we worked really hard, I think, to promote those executive actions, the regulatory actions, the people that we brought into the administration to work on those, and worked hard on legislative pieces, and hope to continue to do that next year.”</p>\n<p>\n            And though the Democratic majority in the Senate will slightly expand in January, Terrell’s office is on the front lines preparing for Republicans to take over the House and launch a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/house-republicans-white-house-hunter-biden/index.html\">wave of congressional investigations into Biden officials</a>.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/politics/louisa-terrell-legislative-director/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kyrsten Sinema </a>decided to shake up the political world on Friday by becoming an independent. The former Democrat is still caucusing with the party in the Senate, so the Democratic caucus still has 51 members. Now, instead of 49 Democrats and two independents within their ranks, the caucus has 48 Democrats and three independents. \n    </p>\n    <p>But that simple math hides a more clouded picture for Democrats and for Sinema herself. Sinema’s interests are no longer necessarily the Democrats’ best interests in the next Congress, and the 2024 Senate map became even more complicated for Democrats with Sinema’s decision.</p>\n    <p>\n            To be clear, Sinema has always been a thorn in the Democrats side during her time in Congress. Over the last two years, Democrats have had to almost always make sure that any bill or nomination had Sinema’s support to have any chance of passing. That’s the math when you have only 50 Senate seats in a 100-seat chamber. A lot of bills and nominations <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2022/03/01/party-unity-vote-studies-underscore-polarized-state-of-the-union/\">were never voted on</a> without Sinema and Manchin’s backing. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            From 2013 (Sinema’s first term in Congress) to 2020, Sinema <a href=\"https://media.cq.com/votewatch/\">voted against her party </a>more than almost any other member of Congress. She stayed with the party about 69% of the time on votes where at least one half of the Democrats voted differently than half of Republicans. The average Democrat voted with their party about 90% of the time on these votes. \n    </p>\n    <p>It’s quite possible that Sinema’s percentage of sticking with the party will lower now that she is an independent. Consider the example of former Sen. Joe Lieberman. The longtime Democrat won reelection as a third-party candidate in 2006, after losing the Democratic primary to a left-wing challenger (the now fairly moderate Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont)</p>\n    <p>Relative to the average Senate Democrat, Lieberman voted with the party 10 points less of the time after becoming an independent than he had in his last term as a Democrat. If that happens with Sinema, she’ll become even more conservative than West Virginia’s Joe Manchin (the most conservative member of the Democratic caucus).</p>\n    <p>This would make sense because the incentive structure is now very different for Sinema. Ahead of a 2024 reelection campaign, she no longer has to worry about winning a Democratic primary. Sinema has to worry about building a coalition of Democrats, independents and Republicans. That is far more difficult to do if you’re seen as too liberal.</p>\n    <p>\n            Indeed, the big reason Sinema became an independent is because it would have been very difficult to win a Democratic primary. Her approval rating among Arizona Democrats in an<a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\"> autumn 2022 CES</a> poll stood at just 25%. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/09/sinema-party-arizona-senate-2024-00073301\">A number of Democrats</a> (e.g. Rep. Ruben Gallego and Rep. Greg Stanton) were already lining up to potentially challenge her in a primary. \n    </p>\n    <p>A question now is whether Sinema’s decision to become an independent will dissuade some of those Democrats from running. The idea being that Sinema still caucuses with the Democrats, and Democrats wouldn’t want to split the Democratic vote in a general election allowing a Republican to win in a purple state like Arizona.</p>\n    <p>It’s an interesting bet from Sinema. After all, Democrats usually don’t run a candidate against independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in Vermont. The Democrats who run against independent Sen. Angus King in Maine have not gained traction in recent elections. Don’t forget the aforementioned Lieberman won as a third-party candidate.</p>\n    <p>The electoral math structure was and is totally different in these circumstances, however. Sanders wouldn’t attract a left-wing Democratic challenger because he is already so progressive. Lieberman declared his third-party candidacy after the primary, so Republicans didn’t have time to find a well-known challenger. Republicans also knew that Lieberman, who was an ardent supporter of the Iraq War, was probably the best they could hope for in the deeply Democratic state of Connecticut.</p>\n    <p>This leaves the King example. King, like Sinema, is a moderate from not a deeply blue or red state. There’s just one problem for Sinema in this analogy: King is popular. He had previously won the governorship twice as an independent and has almost always sported high favorables.</p>\n    <p>\n            Sinema is not popular at all. The <a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\">CES poll</a> had her approval rating below her disapproval rating with Democrats, independents and Republicans in Arizona. Sinema’s overall approval stood at 25% to a disapproval rating of 58%. Other polling isn’t nearly as dire for Sinema, but the average of it all has her firmly being more unpopular than popular. \n    </p>\n    <p>Put another way, Sinema’s current numbers are probably not going to scare off many challengers from either the Democratic or Republican side. Additionally, there’s zero reason for Democrats to cede the ground to Sinema because it would keep a Republican from winning. It isn’t clear at all that Sinema can win as an independent.</p>\n    <p>What Sinema’s move did accomplish is that it made the electoral math a lot more complicated in Arizona and therefore nationally. Having two people in the race who are going to caucus with the Democratic Party likely makes it more difficult for the Democrats to win.</p>\n    <p>One potential worrisome example for Democrats in a purple state (at least then) was the 2010 Florida Senate race. Then Republican Gov. Charlie Crist decided to run as an independent after it became clear he wouldn’t beat the more conservative Republican Marco Rubio in a Republican primary. Crist, who said he would caucus with the Democrats, split the Democratic vote with then Rep. Kendrick Meek, and Rubio cruised to a win.</p>\n    <p>I should point out that Democrats certainly have a chance. The 1968 Alaska Senate race, for example, featured two Democrats (Mike Gravel and then Sen. Ernest Gruening as write-in). Gravel won in the state which Republican Richard Nixon carried, too, by a few points.</p>\n    <p>In 2024, Arizona Republicans could nominate an extreme candidate that flames out. They just lost every major statewide race in 2022 because of who they nominated.</p>\n    <p>\n            Don’t dismiss the possibility too that Sinema could win like Harry Byrd did in the <a href=\"https://vig.coopercenter.org/sites/vig/files/Virginia_News_Letter_1971_Vol._48_No._2.pdf\">1970 Virginia Senate election</a> when both parties nominated candidates. Maybe voters will like Sinema’s new independent registration. \n    </p>\n    <p>Sinema also could find herself flaming out when running in the general election without a major party backing her like Gruening did in 1968 or then Sen. Jacob Javits in the 1980 New York Senate race.</p>\n    <p>We just don’t know.</p>\n    <p>All that said, the Democrats already have a difficult map heading into 2024. Depending on whether the Democrats win the presidency (and have a Democratic vice president who can break Senate ties), they can afford to lose zero to one Senate seats and maintain a majority.</p>\n    <p>The vast majority, 23 of the 34, senators up for reelection in 2024 caucus with the Democrats. An abnormally large number (7) represent states Republican Donald Trump won at least once. This includes Arizona.</p>\n    <p>With Sinema’s break from the Democratic party, the road is, if nothing else, curvier for Democrats.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/politics/kyrsten-sinema-independent-democrats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He alleges a “witch hunt” against him. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.</p>\n<p>\n            Here’s an updated list of developments in Trump’s very complicated set of court cases, beginning with the one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23\">playing out in Manhattan</a> this week.\n    </p>\n<h2>New York state civil court: $250 million fraud case</h2>\n<p>The civil fraud trial, unlike Trump’s multiple criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.</p>\n<p>\n            New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/letitia-james-trump-lawsuit-takeaways-what-to-know/index.html\">$250 million lawsuit</a> in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Judge Arthur Engoron <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/trump-organization-business-fraud/index.html\">has already ruled</a> that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.\n    </p>\n<p>The trial portion of the case, playing out in court in Manhattan, will assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron’s decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out.</p>\n<h2>Federal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit</h2>\n<p>\n            In May, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawsuit-battery-defamation-verdict/index.html\">a federal jury in Manhattan found</a> Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            A separate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-defamation-lawsuit/index.html\">civil defamation lawsuit</a> will only need to decide how much money Trump has to pay her. That case for January 15 – the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.\n    </p>\n<h2>Federal criminal court in DC: 2020 election Interference</h2>\n<p>\n            In August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel/index.html\">special counsel Jack Smith</a>’s investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty. \n    </p>\n<p>The case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>\n            In late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/27/politics/tanya-chutkan-donald-trump-recusal-motion/index.html\">rejected Trump’s request</a> that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters’ prison sentences.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Chutkan set the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/politics/trump-january-6-criminal-case-trial-date-hearing/index.html\">trial’s start date</a> for March 4, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump’s criminal cases expected to proceed. \n    </p>\n<h2>New York criminal court: Hush money payments</h2>\n<p>Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>\n            The former president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/politics/donald-trump-arraignment-new-york/index.html\">pleaded not guilty</a> at his April arraignment in Manhattan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Prosecutors, led by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/politics/alvin-bragg-manhattan-district-attorney-trump/index.html\">Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a>, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.\n    </p>\n<p>Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.</p>\n<p>\n            The trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move. The <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/09/18/politics/stormy-daniels-trump-attorney-judge-conflict/index.html\">next court date</a> is scheduled for February.\n    </p>\n<h2>Georgia criminal court: Efforts to overturn election results</h2>\n<p>\n            Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is using racketeering violations to charge a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/17/politics/trump-georgia-election-indictment-what-to-know/index.html\">broad criminal conspiracy</a> against Trump and 18 others in their efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The probe was launched in 2021 following Trump’s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/03/politics/trump-brad-raffensperger-phone-call-transcript/index.html\">pushed the Republican official to “find” votes</a> to overturn the election results. \n    </p>\n<p>The August indictment also includes how Trump’s team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia; organized fake electors; harassed an election worker; and breached election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia.</p>\n<p>\n            One co-defendant, bail bondsman Scott Hall, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/fulton-county-election-plea-scott-hall/index.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to five counts in the case.\n    </p>\n<p>Fulton County prosecutors have signaled they could offer plea deals to other co-defendants.</p>\n<p>\n            Willis this week <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/politics/bernie-kerik-fulton-county/index.html\">issued a subpoena</a> to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump ally, who in turn demanded an immunity deal in exchange for testimony.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/powell-chesebro-georgia-trial-plea-deals/index.html\">Trial for two co-defendants</a> is expected to begin this month and could last three to five months. A trial date has not been set for Trump, who has pleaded not guilty.\n    </p>\n<h2>Federal criminal court in Florida: Mishandling classified material</h2>\n<p>\n            Trump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges brought by Smith over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Smith added<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-special-counsel/index.html\"> three additional counts </a>in a superseding indictment. \n    </p>\n<p>The investigation centers on sensitive documents that Trump brought to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his White House term ended in January 2021.</p>\n<p>The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.</p>\n<p>\n            Trump was also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/politics/trump-classified-documents-audio/index.html\">caught on tape</a> in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the former president discussed holding secret documents he did not declassify.\n    </p>\n<p>Smith’s additional charges allege that Trump and his employees attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of the records.</p>\n<p>Trial is not expected until May, after most presidential primaries have concluded.</p>\n<p>\n            <strong>There are other cases to note:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Trump Organization: Convicted of criminal tax fraud</h2>\n<p>\n            Trump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html\">convicted in December</a> by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n    </p>\n<p>Manhattan prosecutors told a jury the case was about “greed and cheating,” laying out a scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks such as luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.</p>\n<p>\n            Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/politics/allen-weisselberg-pleads-guilty/index.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to his role in the tax scheme. He was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/politics/allen-weisselberg-released-rikers/index.html\">released</a> after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.\n    </p>\n<h2>January 6: Lawsuits by police officers</h2>\n<p>\n            Several members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/capitol-police-trump-mehta/index.html\">are suing Trump</a>, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot. \n    </p>\n<p>The various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit the incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p>\n            In August, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/politics/trump-sicknick-lawsuit/index.html\">Trump requested</a> to put on hold the lawsuit related to the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, citing his various criminal trials. The estate of Sicknick, who died after responding to the attack on the Capitol, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/05/politics/sicknick-lawsuit-trump-january-6/index.html\">is suing</a> two rioters involved in the attack and Trump for his alleged role in egging it on.\n    </p>\n<p>Other lawsuits have been put on hold while a federal appeals court considers whether Trump had absolute immunity as the sitting president.</p>\n<h2>Personal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit</h2>\n<p>\n            Former top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/peter-strzok-fired-fbi/index.html\">who was fired</a> in 2018 after the revelation that he criticized Trump in text messages, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/peter-strzok-sues-back-pay-job-trump/index.html\">sued</a> the Justice Department, alleging he was terminated improperly. \n    </p>\n<p>In summer 2017, former special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from his team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election after an internal investigation revealed texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page that could be read as exhibiting political bias.</p>\n<p>Strzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies, part of the larger ire the then-president expressed toward the FBI during the Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until he was fired in August 2018.</p>\n<p>\n            Trump is set to be <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/28/government-shutdown-trump-deposition-00118927\">deposed this month</a> as part of the case, according to Politico. \n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A dozen Republican senators from across the country voted with Democrats before Thanksgiving to limit debate and move toward a final vote. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/senate-republicans-vote-same-sex-marriage\">RELATED: Meet the 12 Republicans who voted to consider the Respect for Marriage Act</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>It next goes to the House for approval before President Joe Biden can sign it into law.</p>\n    <p>But there is a fair amount of fine print.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>First, the bill does not require all states to allow same-sex marriage,</strong> even though that is the current reality under the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Rather, if the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell and previous state prohibitions on same-sex marriage came back into effect, the Respect for Marriage Act would require states and the federal government to respect marriages conducted in places where it is legal.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>There are religious exceptions. </strong>Republican supporters have emphasized the elements in this Senate version that protect nonprofit and religious organizations from having to provide support for same-sex marriages.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I will be supporting the substitute amendment because it will ensure our religious freedoms are upheld and protected, one of the bedrocks of our democracy,” said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito <a href=\"https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-votes-to-advance-consideration-of-the-respect-for-marriage-act-plans-to-support-substitute-amendment\">in a statement</a> after helping break the filibuster.\n    </p>\n    <p>It took months of behind-the-scenes effort to bring 10-plus Republicans on board.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>This is all academic right now.</strong> The bill is only being passed in case the now-solidly conservative Supreme Court, which has taken delight in upending precedent, were to revisit the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that created a national right to marriage for same-sex couples.\n    </p>\n    <p>Two of the justices who voted in favor of that ruling have been replaced by Republican-appointed conservatives, which means that if the case were heard today, there’s a real likelihood it would be decided differently.</p>\n    <p>\n            While Justice Samuel Alito seemed to want to wall off the abortion rights precedent upended by the Supreme Court earlier this year, CNN’s Ariane de Vogue has written about how the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization could affect issues like marriage. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/politics/roe-alito-obergefell-loving\">Read her story</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A complete 180 in Congress</h2>\n    <p>\n            Despite the fine print, it is almost unbelievable that less than<strong> </strong>a generation ago, Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president in the ’90s, worked together to protect the “institution of marriage” from same-sex unions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, it’s Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president, working together to protect same-sex marriage from a government institution.</p>\n    <p>\n            During that time, public support for same-sex marriage grew from about a quarter of the public in the year the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx\">71% in Gallup polling this year</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The issue has played a role in multiple US elections, including, arguably, the one that just took place.</p>\n    <p>\n            Here’s a brief history of marriage equality playing a role in prior<strong> </strong>election years:\n    </p>\n    <h2>26 years ago, there was united opposition</h2>\n    <p>In 1996, Republican majorities in the House and Senate sensed a political opening after then-President Bill Clinton failed to allow gay people to openly serve in the military.</p>\n    <p>\n            They were also trying to get ahead of a Hawaii court decision that could have legalized same-sex marriage in that state. Fearing every state might have to recognize same-sex unions, Republicans pushed the Defense of Marriage Act,<strong> </strong>known as DOMA. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            It declared marriage as between one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize marriages. It also<strong> </strong>withheld federal benefits from married same-sex couples. In 2013, a part of DOMA<strong> </strong>was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/26/politics/scotus-same-sex-doma/index.html\">found to be unconstitutional</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            DOMA had broad approval. Democrats like then-Sen. Biden <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1042/vote_104_2_00280.htm\">voted for the bill</a>. Current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and many other Democrats whose names you’d recognize, were among the 342 who voted for the bill in the House. \n    </p>\n    <p>Current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the 67 members to vote “no,” along with then-Rep. Steve Gunderson, who at the time was the House’s only out gay Republican.</p>\n    <h2>18 years ago, Republicans used opposing gay marriage to their advantage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2004,<strong> </strong>placing anti-gay-marriage amendments on ballots in key states like Ohio was smart politics. It helped George W. Bush win reelection to the White House and the GOP gain seats in the US Senate. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Bush <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/25/elec04.prez.bush.marriage/index.html\">endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage</a>. The Democratic candidate, John Kerry, also opposed same-sex marriage at the time. \n    </p>\n    <h2>14 years ago, Democrat Barack Obama opposed gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2008,<strong> </strong>even as more in his party began to publicly support marriage equality, Obama continued his opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He has more recently said and written that he always personally supported same-sex marriage<strong> </strong>rights. His campaign aide David Axelrod has written that Obama made a calculated decision to oppose gay marriage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “He grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ‘sacred union,’” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/10/politics/obama-gay-marriage-axelrod/index.html\">Axelrod wrote </a>in a memoir.\n    </p>\n    <h2>10 years ago, Obama made the political calculation to support gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2012,<strong> </strong>following the lead of then-Vice President Biden, Obama officially evolved on the issue and said he now supported marriage equality. It was a big<strong> </strong>moment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A few years later, in 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling/index.html\">Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>5 years ago, Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to publicly support marriage equality</h2>\n    <p>\n            “I’m fine with it,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.html\">Trump said </a>in 2016 during an interview with “60 Minutes.” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He’d go on to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/politics/we-count-new-hampshire/\">brag about </a>being a champion for gay rights, although many LGBTQ activists would disagree.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Now, completing the transformation</h2>\n    <p>The politicians of the ’90s have largely evolved with the country.</p>\n    <p>\n            But this summer,<strong> </strong>one of the Supreme Court’s relics from the ’90s, Justice Clarence Thomas, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/abortion-ruling-gay-rights-contraceptives/index.html\">questioned the 2015 marriage decision</a> he opposed. As a result, Republicans and Democrats have come together again to undo what they did in 1996 and try to guarantee marriage as a right for all Americans.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/respect-for-marriage-act-what-matters/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
