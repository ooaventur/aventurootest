    "body": "<p>It’s early afternoon at the latest national march for Gaza in central London. A man is wearing a sweatshirt bearing a photograph of Hind Rajab, the five-year-old girl who was killed in the Gaza conflict last year along with family members and the paramedics who tried to save her. He doesn’t want to be named. But it is, he says, his attempt “to keep her memory alive, until we get justice … Whether it takes one month, one year, 100 years, I’m not giving up. I’m not going to stop wearing this until the killers are behind bars.”</p>\n<p>It’s a heart-rending example of a phenomenon common to all these marches over the past two years: people are here to call for an end to the war and the Israeli occupation, and many are using their clothes to bolster their message.</p>\n<p>Far from being a frivolous afterthought, protest dressing has become an important part of these marches. Wearing the symbols and colours of solidarity can be an expression of grief and a call to action.</p>\n<p>“Enough is enough,” says Mariama, who is in her 30s and works for the NHS in Nottingham. She is wearing a football-style shirt with a Palestinian flag in place of the club crest. Alongside it are the words “viva Palestina” and a visual representation of the contested area.</p>\n<p>“It’s one way of giving voice to your opposition, my opposition, to the occupation of Palestine,” says the Rev Poppy Hughes, 65, of her Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) pin badge. Otherwise “there’s nothing to identify you as somebody who’s opposed to the occupation and the genocide and the starvation.”</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Loulou and Suhail on the march. Photographs: Ethan Parker/The Guardian</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>There’s a sense of shared project about it. “You feel more united when you’re sharing the dress code,” says Suhail, 44, who is here with Loulou, 45; both are wearing their solidarity on their sleeves.</p>\n<p>For the people here, simple things such as a keffiyeh or a badge signify solidarity without words. Watermelons, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/08/1222718339/why-watermelons-are-symbol-of-palestinian-solidarity\">a symbol of Palestinian solidarity</a> since public displays of the Palestinian flag were outlawed by Israel, hang as earrings or are crocheted into hats. Jaiman, 28, from Bexley, is wearing a shirt covered in them. So too is 71-year-old Tony from London. A longtime wearer of Hawaiian shirts, he thought he “should get a better fruit”.</p>\n<p>Others are getting creative, wearing entire outfits crafted from keffiyehs or dressing from head to toe in the colours of the Palestinian flag. For each protest, 65-year-old Lamdy customises something. This time it’s an old white shirt painted with a watermelon. “Words are not being heard,” she says.</p>\n<p>Protest dressing has long been used as a way to express support for a cause. For Camille Benda, author of Dressing the Resistance: The Visual Language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/protest\">Protest</a>, it is “using objects in the form of garments, accessories, clothing, fashion, costume, to send a non-verbal visual message”. According to Stanford’s Richard Ford, author of Dress Codes: Crimes of Fashion and Laws of Attire, while “the specifics vary quite a lot … it’s when people choose a common style of dress as a symbol of their political struggle”. He points to the suffragette movement wearing white and people during the civil rights movement wearing their “Sunday best”.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p>Taylor Benac dances in a pink ‘pussyhat’ during the Women’s March in Washington DC, January 2017. Photograph: Ali Smith/The Guardian</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>The impact is greatest when single items become shorthand for a movement. <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-pussyhat?srsltid=AfmBOooTOXQnWfhACeQpmtgSMN-QxULpySnZVU2HDGSTBrTta6dYRMkT\">The pink pussyhat</a> became a symbol in the first Trump administration. In austerity-gripped Greece, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30811426\">rubber gloves became an emblem of political discontent</a>. And there were the <i>gilets jaunes</i> of the recent French revolts.</p>\n<p>The power of these clothes is demonstrated by how authorities try to stymie it: during the first Palestinian intifada, women would stitch symbols of resistance on to what became known as “intifada dresses” – an update of the region’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2025/aug/18/a-symbol-of-palestinian-presence-and-identity-the-personal-and-political-world-of-tatreez-in-pictures\">traditional style of embroidery, known as </a><i> tatreez</i>. According to Rachel Dedman, a </p>\n<p><i>tatreez</i>expert, “these dresses, just like a flag … were forbidden and dangerous to have”. Even in the UK, protest clothing is controversial: at a protest in Parliament Square last August, one man was arrested for wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/protester-arrested-wearing-plasticine-action-t-shirt-palestine-gaza-protest\">Plasticine Action</a>”, complete with a picture of the Aardman character Morph. (He was released not long afterwards.)</p>\n<p>Ayham Hassan is a Palestinian designer whose graduate collection at Central Saint Martins this summer caused waves. Originally from the West Bank but currently in London, he understands what it is to protest through clothes, which he does symbolically through his work, “because I’m discussing a concept that is about my culture … about the genocide, it becomes unapologetically a protest to free Palestine”. But he also uses fashion to express himself more tangibly: for his graduate collection, a <i>tatreez</i> scarf made by his mum had to be, in effect, smuggled from the West Bank to London. Even though there’s no law against it, he says, “it’s not safe to have <i>tatreez</i> going from one place to another because it’s clearly Palestinian … and it’s clear that they see that as a threat.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/19/wear-it-loud-wear-it-proud-how-marchers-for-gaza-are-bringing-protest-dressing-up-to-date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It’s not meant to provoke; it’s meant for people to think.”</p>\n    <p>While Vin and Omi have long championed environmental sustainability, this season they were also inspired by other social causes.</p>\n    <p>Three garments were created specifically to support a global anti-bullying charity.</p>\n    <p>“Models we’ve known have killed themselves along the way because of bullying,” Omi said of the fashion industry. “It’s really, really important.”</p>\n    <p>Even their royal collaboration is framed as a way of finding “little beauties” amid wider turmoil.</p>\n    <p>“Amongst all this dysphoria and chaos, this collaboration with the King is about showing people there are still little beauties you can find,” Omi said.</p>\n    <p>While the pair have loved collaborating with the King, Omi notes: “The only two things we have in common with him are the environment and humour – everything else we’re not interested in.”</p>\n    <p>And while the show featured latex gowns and parachute dresses, the designers argue the real subversion is in their methods.</p>\n    <p>“Fashion isn’t curing cancer. We’re a service industry, problem-solvers.</p>\n    <p>“We can’t fight everything… but what we’re good at is infiltrating big organisations and making them think about the environment,” said Omi.</p>\n    <p>For Prue Leith, striding out in a red parachute rather than a kitchen apron, it was a chance to upend expectations.</p>\n    <p>For the Vin and Omi audience, it was proof that style and sustainability can coexist, even at London Fashion Week.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/fashion/prue-leith-victoria-sarah-beeny-model-b2829628.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Both of my kids have had one of these for five years and are going strong!

Those plastic particles infiltrate all systems of the body, including the brain, where they can accumulate and trigger Alzheimer's-like conditions, according to a new study by researchers in the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy.</p>\n<p>After a previous study that showed how microplastics can infiltrate all systems of the body -- including the blood-brain barrier, which protects the brain from harmful substances as small as viruses and bacteria -- URI pharmacy assistant professor Jaime Ross expanded the study to determine the brain health impacts of the plastic toxins. Her findings indicate that the accumulation of micro- and nanoplastics in the brain can lead to cognitive decline and even Alzheimer's disease, especially in those who carry genetic risk factors.</p>\n<p>Ross' latest study, published recently in the journal <i>Environmental Research Communications</i>, examined mice that had been genetically modified to include the naturally occurring gene APOE4, a strong indicator of Alzheimer's risk making people 3.5 times more likely to develop the disease than those who carry the APOE3 variant of the gene that is passed from parents to offspring.</p>\n<p>\"In these mice, like in people, it's not a guarantee that you're going to see any changes in cognition. You could have identical twins both carrying APOE4, one totally cognitively healthy, and the other could develop Alzheimer's disease,\" Ross said. \"So that tells us there's something about lifestyle, something about the environment going on. There are modifiable factors we're studying related to Alzheimer's-diet, exercise, vitamins, and especially environmental toxins like microplastics. If you carry the APOE4, and you happen to consume a lot of microplastics, will this contribute to Alzheimer's disease?\"</p>\n<p>To find out, Ross and her team exposed two groups of mice -- one with the APOE4 variant and one with APOE3 -- to micro- and nanoplastics in their drinking water over a period of three weeks. The tiny particles from polystyrene -- among the most abundant plastics in the world, found in Styrofoam take-out containers, plastic cups and more -- infiltrated the mice' organs, including the brain, as expected. The research included a control group from each APOE designation did not receive microplastic exposure.</p>\n<p>Ross' team then ran the mice through a series of tests to examine their cognitive ability, beginning with an open-field test, in which researchers put a mouse in a chamber and allow it to explore at will for 90 minutes. Ordinarily, a mouse will hug the walls, naturally attempting to hide from potential predators. However, after microplastic exposure, the APOE4 mice -- especially the male mice -- tended to wander more in the middle of the chamber and spend time in open space, leaving themselves vulnerable to predators.</p>\n<p>To test their ability to recognize novel objects, Ross placed mice in an open chamber with two distinct objects. After having time to explore the objects, the mice were removed and returned later, this time with one of the objects replaced with a different shape. The female mice with APOE4 and microplastic exposure were slow to recognize the novel objects, if they did at all, a sign of cognitive decline affecting memory.</p>\n<p>\"In the first test, you can see the males are spending more time and resting more in the center of the arena. In females, we saw changes in novel object recognition,\" Ross said. \"In human Alzheimer's patients, men tend to experience more changes in apathy; they care less. Women experience more changes in memory. So the memory and the apathy connection are pretty clear: When you expose animals that are carrying the largest known risk factor in humans for developing Alzheimer's disease to micro- and nanopastics, lo and behold, their behavior changes in a sex-dependent manner similar to the sex-dependent differences we see with Alzheimer's patients.\"</p>\n<p>The results are concerning enough to warrant further study into the cognitive decline caused by exposure to micro- and nanoplastics, which are among the most prominent environmental toxins to which people are routinely exposed. (A separate URI study released in 2023 revealed of the extent to which microplastics accumulate in the environment, shockingly finding that the top two inches of the floor of Narragansett Bay contain more than 1,000 tons of microplastics.)</p>\n<p>Ross is continuing to expand her research into the topic and encourages others to do so, in the hope of leading to better regulation of the toxins. The Microplastics Safety Act, introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in July would direct the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to study the human health impacts of microplastics in food and water, specifically focusing on vulnerabilities for children, the endocrine and reproductive systems, and links to cancer and chronic illnesses.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250917221010.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This season, determined to fill the gap, I started my hunt—and was quickly met with endless options. Short, long, tan, khaki… the list felt never-ending. But during one of my many Instagram doom-scrolls, I noticed a pattern: all of my favourite stylish people were wearing a trench coat from the same high-street brand—Nobody’s Child.</p>\n    <p>Nobody’s Child is no stranger to a hero piece. Best known for its <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-nobodys-child-dresses\">summer dresses </a>loved by celebrities and fashion insiders, the brand also delivers in autumn—particularly when it comes to trench coats. Last year, its classic trench coat was spotted all over <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tag/london-fashion-week\">London Fashion Week</a>, and this season the reception is proving just as strong. As for which designs are causing a stir? Honestly, take your pick.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6WPQiZTLxGqYnDT49dtii.jpg\" alt=\"Monikh wearing a cream Nobody&amp;#039;s Child trench coat\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/monikh/\">@monikh</a>)</p>\n    <p>The cream <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101131066-15869614?sid=whowhatwear-us-8420240328497812906&amp;url=https://www.nobodyschild.com/products/beige-single-breasted-car-coat-o254118wht\">Single-Breasted Trench</a> was the first to grab my attention, worn by both <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/monikh/?hl=en\">Monikh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nlmarilyn/?hl=en\">Marilyn</a>. Both kept things pared-back and chic, layering the coat over jeans and simple basics—an approach that highlights just how versatile this piece can be. The checked lining adds a subtle twist, but it’s that creamy neutral outer that makes it the perfect throw-on for everyday dressing.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emmarosethatcher/?hl=en\">Emma Rose Thatcher</a>, meanwhile, made a strong case for the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101131066-15869614?sid=whowhatwear-us-6610003963189087470&amp;url=https://www.nobodyschild.com/products/khaki-trench-coat-o254367grn?queryID=0c577207bc17a95360f366a162112635\">Khaki Double-Breasted style</a>. Rather than reaching for tan, she opted for khaki to give her look extra depth, pairing it with denim and loafers. It’s a combination that feels classic yet modern, proving how easily this trench can elevate even the simplest outfit formula.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9koH8GsGvHpMxqDKfwYe6.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Rose Thatcher wearing the khaki Nobody&amp;#039;s Child trench coat\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emmarosethatcher/\">@emmarosethatcher</a>)</p>\n    <p>Finally, Marilyn showed the transformative power of the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-101131066-15869614?sid=whowhatwear-us-1129380195225230246&amp;url=https://www.nobodyschild.com/products/camel-cape-trench-coat-o254660cml?queryID=0c577207bc17a95360f366a162112635\">Cape Trench</a>, a chic alternative to the classic trench coat. Styling hers over a dress with <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/tag/tights\">tights</a> and pumps, she turned a practical autumn piece into something altogether more refined and statement-making. It’s the kind of outerwear that looks equally at home for a commute to the office as it does at an evening dinner, thanks to its directional cut.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ae9M43MEP9Fio6ZaWuw4hb.jpg\" alt=\"Marilyn NK wearing the cape Nobody&amp;#039;s Child trench coat\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nlmarilyn/\">@nlmarilyn</a>)</p>\n    <p>Whether layered over casual denim or styled with dresses, these coats strike that rare balance between timeless and on trend.

Similarly, we were absolutely fed. As I sit here scrolling through my notes and the many (oh so many) backstage clips in my camera roll, I'm still reeling from the avant-garde glam moments that literally took my breath away, including the gilded lashes at Ulla Johnson, the pierced nails at Kim Shui, and the literal takes on hat hair at Collina Strada. (Suddenly, I need a</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mustafayanaz/?hl=en\">ified baseball cap wig in my closet.)</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The inspiration will linger long after the runway shows come to an end, so take a gander through my NYFW trend report and familiarize yourself with these looks sooner rather than later. The collections themselves may be geared toward spring/summer 2026, but beauty trends cycle in and out of the spotlight at breakneck speed. I'd wager these 10 will be on your feeds in a blink. Adopt them early on, and I'll know you have impeccable, influential taste.</p>\n<h2>Colorful Lashes</h2>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/73RNwEGgocWWqWUWXnoDWJ.gif\" alt=\"Collage of colorful lashes from NYFW spring/summer 2026.\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamieeschneider/?hl=en\">@jamieeschneider</a>; Launchmetrics)</p>\n<p>Put down the black mascara! According to the spring/summer 2026 runways, lashes won't look inky. They'll be <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-colored-mascaras\">neon pink, translucent white, and aquamarine</a>. Consider Collina Strada, where lead artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isamayaffrench/?hl=en\">Isamaya Ffrench</a> used colorful lash clusters to create an extra-fluttery effect. \"Everybody has a beautiful little piece of colored wing at the end of their lash that looks great with the [eye shadow] combination or is a bit of a contrast,\" she says backstage. At Eckhaus Latta, however, the iconic MUA opted for white, semitransparent lashes for a more ethereal aesthetic. \"They catch the light in a way that feels delicate and dreamlike,\" Ffrench says.</p>\n<p>Anna Sui also featured some otherworldly lashes (and swirls of eye shadow that looked straight out of a watercolor painting—more on that later), and models' wisps at Ulla Johnson appeared coated in liquid gold. No gold mascara? No problem. \"I'm crushing gold [eye shadow] with mixing medium, and we're painting the lashes—top and bottom—and leaving whatever haphazard little mistakes that come on the lash line,\" lead makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/romyglow/?hl=en\">Romy Soleimani</a> tells me backstage.</p>\n<h2>Seen Backstage</h2>\n<h2>Boho Waves</h2>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FyUCk67tHHmz7syZEjAr9K.gif\" alt=\"Collage of boho waves from NYFW spring/summer 2026.\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alyssabrascia/?hl=en\">@alyssabrascia</a>; Launchmetrics)</p>\n<p>The term <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/hair/ghost-waves\">\"undone waves\"</a> is somewhat of an oxymoron (it often takes just as much, if not more, effort to make them appear effortless), but leave it to Cynthia Rowley, Simkhai, and Anna Sui to host a master class on lived-in bends. At the latter, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/garrennewyork/\">Garren</a>, celebrity hairstylist and cofounder of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1711942&amp;xcust=whowhatwear_us_4849479034113510215&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.randco.com%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whowhatwear.com%2Fbeauty%2Fnew-york-fashion-week-beauty-trends-spring-summer-2026\">R+Co</a>, styled those loose boho waves with '20s-inspired victory rolls at the crown—think haphazard texture combined with a bit of structure. Whimsical waves were the main event at Cynthia Rowley, where models' strands twirled in the breeze at the outdoor show in Wagner Park. \"We're not using any curling irons,\" lead stylist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/justinemarjan/?hl=en\">Justine Marjan</a> tells me about how the stylists kept the bends from looking too uniform. \"We're either using a diffuser or a flat iron to enhance the wave pattern.\"</p>\n<p>\"You just want to mess it up a little bit but not in a grungy way or the surfer, ocean-y wave that we've seen,\" Simkhai lead <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hollismithhead/\">Holli Smith</a> says regarding the show's \"pool hair\" inspiration. <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-mousses-for-curly-hair\">Mousse</a> and texturizing spray will be your hero products here. Just make sure to break up any lingering cast to keep the style from looking too done.</p>\n<h2>Seen Backstage</h2>\n<h2>Nail Jewelry</h2>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w3DEFB3iK6N9svwhHoMVKJ.gif\" alt=\"Collage of nail jewelry from NYFW spring/summer 2026.\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamieeschneider/?hl=en\">@jamieeschneide</a>r; Launchmetrics; Courtesy of OPI)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/nails/textured-manicure-trend\">Three-dimensional nail art</a> isn't going anywhere, but rather than sticking gemstones on top of your nail plate, level up the trend and have them dangling off the tips—you know, like teeny piercings. These elements can't help but be a statement, whether you opt for edgy chain details like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cocamichelle/?hl=en\"> Coca Michelle</a> at Grace Ling or dainty initial charms like </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sojinails/?hl=en\">at Kim Shui. (No, it doesn't hurt, assuming your nails extend far enough from the base of your fingertips.) Feel free to pierce every nail for a bold teardrop effect, or stick to one or two tips to keep it minimalist chic.</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Seen Backstage</h2>\n<h2>Watercolor Finishes</h2>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sr8iFxxTzMzeTp2tQXi8kH.gif\" alt=\"Collage of watercolor finishes in makeup looks from NYFW spring/summer 2026.\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamieeschneider/?hl=en\">@jamieeschneider</a>; Launchmetrics)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/makeup/beauty-editor-summer-2025-makeup-favorites\">Watercolor blush</a> took center stage this past spring and summer, but looking ahead, we can expect painterly applications all over the eyes. Take it from Anna Sui's show, dubbed Desert Blooms, where models donned layers of creamy blue-purple eye shadow (plus sky-blue mascara!) courtesy of Dame <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/patmcgrathreal/?hl=en\">Pat McGrath</a>. At Collina Strada, Ffrench also chose \"lovely, sort of soft\" shades in varying watercolor hues, adding a wash of shimmer to further desaturate the tones before models walked the runways.</p>\n<p>Cloudy eyes and lips were the theme at Ulla Johnson and Sandy Liang, which were meant to look lucid, blurred, and transparent—as if models had just woken up from a dream. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charlieriddle/?hl=en\">Charlie Riddle</a>, lead artist at Sandy Liang, specifically committed to the \"sleepy girl\" look, using a wash of mauve liquid eye shadow to \"give it this very hazy, diffused [effect].\"</p>\n<h2>Seen Backstage</h2>\n<h2>Luxe Brown</h2>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUJUzc8SUUuAiRrBtYjZvJ.gif\" alt=\"Collage of luxe brown makeup from NYFW spring/summer 2026.\"/>\n    </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jamieeschneider/?hl=en\">@jamieeschneider</a>; Launchmetrics)</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/beauty/new-york-fashion-week-beauty-trends-spring-summer-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A six-sided form was chosen as it allows the height of the seat to be altered by rotating the legs.</p><p>\"The idea is to have one piece that can be as versatile as possible while also becoming iconic,\" said Aparicio. \"With modularity and accessibility in mind, our goal was to have a bench that could have three different heights, which is desirable according to accessibility guidelines.\"</p><p>The legs are made by covering a plywood jig with upholstery foam. Cut cardboard shapes stapled to the foam create organically shaped holes that lend the piece a soft, pillowy look.</p><p>The foam models were 3D-scanned at the <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/tag/bartlett/\">Bartlett School of Architecture</a> and transformed into digital files that were used to CNC mill a replica of the final part.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/this-bench-has-legs-store-ldf-2025_dezeen_2364_col_1-852x568.jpg\" alt=\"Piece of metal on a floor\"/><p>The two halves of this pattern were then used to create sand moulds, into which the molten aluminium was poured to form each leg. The legs are fixed to the seat using laser-cut and welded steel brackets.</p><p>The seat was initially made using recycled plastic sheets donated by surface specialist <a href=\"https://smile-plastics.com/\">Smile Plastics</a>, but following a meeting with a representative in charge of public spaces at King's Cross, it was identified that wood is the preferred material for public seating in the UK.</p><p>This information led the designers to adapt the bench by replacing the plastic seat with a plank of weather-resistant cedar sourced from London-based sustainable timber supplier <a href=\"https://www.fallenandfelled.co.uk/\">Fallen &amp; Felled</a>.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/this-bench-has-legs-store-ldf-2025_dezeen_2364_col_4-852x1278.jpg\" alt=\"Metal legs of Public bench for King's Cross from This Bench Has Legs project by Store and Attua Aparicio\"/><p>The bench was unveiled during <a href=\"https://londondesignfestival.com/\">London Design Festival 2025</a> as part of an exhibition where visitors were invited to gather, sit and learn about the project.</p><p>According to Aparicio, further development is needed to evolve the prototype into a fully functioning solution that can be installed in the public realm.</p><p>Her hope is that Store can secure additional funding to help develop the system by adding a backrest and armrest. The ambition is that the council might purchase the benches, with the funds raised helping to support future after-school clubs.</p><graphic src=\"https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2025/09/this-bench-has-legs-store-ldf-2025_dezeen_2364_col_8-852x1065.jpg\" alt=\"Poster for This Bench Has Legs project by Store and Attua Aparicio\"/><p>Store is an association of artists, architects and designers that supports young people from underrepresented backgrounds as they seek to apply to creative courses.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Kingston, New York’s Four Corners is celebrated for its craggy stone structures: it’s the only crossroad in the country in which all of the buildings date to pre-Revolutionary War days. They’re well-preserved, zoned for residential and commercial use, and not entirely time warps: Number 45 Crown Street is the new headquarters of Sawkille, Jonah Meyer and Tara DeLisio’s artisanal furniture company, a longstanding Remodelista favorite.</p>\n    <p>The Sawkille workshop has been in Kingston for the last 20 years, so when Tara, creative director of the business, saw the house in a listing, the couple made the decision to move out of their gallery-like space in nearby Rhinebeck and turn the landmark into their showcase, preserving the interior as is, from front parlor and dining room to upstairs bedroom and bath. Says Jonah, “It was a cool opportunity to present our work in a residential setting.”</p>\n    <p>Jonah grew up in what he describes as a hippie family of makers: his father, a jeweler, built their house in Central Pennsylvania, and his mother is a potter. Jonah himself majored in painting at RISD and fell into furniture design after building some chairs for his senior show: “all of my professors bought them, so I kept making chairs.” Someone who is also incessantly drawing, painting, and whittling, he welcomed the opportunity to playfully but respectfully leave his stamp on the place.

They were seen walking in the town—and then they stopped seeing her. Kids passing by peered through the parted curtains and spotted the doctor dining with a skeleton seated across from him. He was run out of town.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sawkille-showroom-kingston-ny-2.jpg\" alt=\"the compact two story house shares a backyard with the adjoining dwelling—som 18\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sawkille-showroom-kingston-ny-3.jpg\" alt=\"though the exterior of the building can&amp;#8\\2\\17;t be touched, painting is a 19\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/hc-153/marlboro-blue\">Marlboro Blue</a>that he free painted on the mantel and in a running band under the ceiling.

Consider this an ever-so-slightly pricier follow-up: For just an Alexander Hamilton—or 59 percent of the cost of Flavortown’s favorite burger—you can add one of these game-upping accessories to your pack.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_159203\" class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.31.48%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Alpine Start Coffee\" srcset=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.31.48 PM.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.31.48 PM.jpg?width=768 768w\"><figcaption class=\"pom-caption\"><span class=\"article__caption\">Alpine Start Coffee</span> (Photo: Courtesy)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Better Coffee</h2>\n<p class=\"buy-button flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-0 md:gap-2\"><a class=\"inline-flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full text-neutral-900 hover:cursor-pointer bg-platform hover:bg-yellow-400 py-very-tight px-base-tight gap-tight font-semibold font-utility-2 text-center hover:text-text-primary w-full md:w-1/2 md:inline-block md:px-1 o-button btn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rei.pxf.io/c/2850304/1448521/17195?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F123167%2Falpine-start-instant-coffee-package-of-8\"><span class=\"\">Alpine Start: $10 for 8 Packets at REI</span></a></p>\n<p>When Starbucks introduced Via, their line of instant coffee, in 2009, it was a notable step up in quality for caffeineheads everywhere: Instead of glugging burnt Folgers, backpackers could start their day sipping on something more full-bodied.

(You’ll need a lot of tinder and a lot of patience, making it a better emergency fallback than everyday solution.) One thing we love it for, though? Lighting a camp stove. On the Fjallraven Classic in northern Sweden, I figured out I could use it to spark my burner from about a foot away, removing the need for me to maneuver a lighter next to the burner and effectively eliminating singed arm hairs. Walmart’s Ozark Trail Flint and Steel is a compact, cheap version that packs together in a plastic box the size of a couple of sticks of gum.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_159205\" class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.33.47%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Fozzils Bowl\" srcset=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.33.47 PM.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.33.47 PM.jpg?width=768 768w\"><figcaption class=\"pom-caption\"><span class=\"article__caption\">Fozzils Bowl</span> (Photo: Courtesy)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A Fold-Flat Bowl</h2>\n<p class=\"buy-button flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-0 md:gap-2\"><a class=\"inline-flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full text-neutral-900 hover:cursor-pointer bg-platform hover:bg-yellow-400 py-very-tight px-base-tight gap-tight font-semibold font-utility-2 text-center hover:text-text-primary w-full md:w-1/2 md:inline-block md:px-1 o-button btn\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fozzils.com/bowlz\"><span class=\"\">Fozzils Snapfold Bowls: $10 for 2 at Fozzils</span></a></p>\n<p>Flat-pack bowls may not be the perfect backcountry tableware (I personally award that honor to Guyot Designs’ squishy silicone bowls) but they are some of the most versatile.

You could use natural materials instead, but after a couple of days, you may find yourself feeling less than comfortable. One easy solution: a trail bidet, which lets you ditch all that for an instant fresh-and-clean feeling. The lowest-tech solution is to buy a disposable plastic water bottle and poke a hole in the cap. However, CuloClean’s universal cap, which secures to a water bottle of your choice with its rubber O-rings, lets you wield your bidet at a friendlier angle.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_159206\" class=\"pom-image-wrap photo-aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.35.28%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"TOAKS Pot Pocket\" srcset=\"https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.35.28 PM.jpg?width=300 300w, https://cdn.backpacker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-18-at-6.35.28 PM.jpg?width=768 768w\"><figcaption class=\"pom-caption\"><span class=\"article__caption\">TOAKS Pot Pocket</span> (Photo: Courtesy)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>A Pot Pocket</h2>\n<p class=\"buy-button flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-0 md:gap-2\"><a class=\"inline-flex shrink-0 items-center justify-center rounded-full text-neutral-900 hover:cursor-pointer bg-platform hover:bg-yellow-400 py-very-tight px-base-tight gap-tight font-semibold font-utility-2 text-center hover:text-text-primary w-full md:w-1/2 md:inline-block md:px-1 o-button btn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=13757&amp;pw=322957&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.garagegrowngear.com%2Fproducts%2Fpot-pocket-by-toaks&amp;website_id=322957\"><span class=\"\">TOAKS Pot Pocket (Large): $10 at Garage Grown Gear</span></a></p>\n<p>I’ve written about my love for AlpineAire’s (H)Eat Pouch, a neoprene pocket that slips easily around any pot or dehydrated meal to save fuel, speed up rehydration, and ensure your dinner is still piping hot when it’s ready to eat.

Trump has a long history of leading with remarks about how others look. After meeting with Prince William in Paris last year, he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/12/08/world-news/trump-gushes-over-very-handsome-prince-william-after-paris-meeting-some-people-look-better-in-person/\">told the New York Post</a>, “He’s a good-looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night. Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.” </p>\n<p>The president frequently comments on the attractiveness of people he encounters ― from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/central-casting-trump-is-talking-more-than-ever-about-mens-looks\">military servicemen</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/like-someone-from-central-casting-kavanaughs-life-seems-scripted-for-supreme-court/\">judges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/25/donald-trump-often-uses-central-casting-describe-those-around-him/2981978002/\">foreign aides</a> ― often using the term “central casting.” He has even <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-trump-demands-death-penalty/story?id=125436079\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZO7mFAafd/\">described</a> a murdered Ukrainian refugee in terms of her beauty, and <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1965880535659470994\">his social media posts</a> following the death of Charlie Kirk described the slain activist’s widow as “beautiful.”</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Trump is also quick to lobby appearance-based insults, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/trump-women-insults.html\">particularly toward women</a>. Just a few of <a href=\"https://theweek.com/politics/things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women\">the many examples</a> include calling Jessica Chastain “not hot,” Stormy Daniels “horseface,” Rosie O’Donnell “fat” and “a pig,” and Bette Midler “extremely unattractive.”</p>\n<p>Although the president isn’t the only person with this compulsion to constantly comment on people’s looks, seeing this fixation from someone at the highest level of government raises bigger questions: What does the tendency to focus on appearance say about someone’s values, worldview and character? And how does this kind of rhetoric, especially from public figures, affect people as individuals and our culture at large?</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>What This Habit Says About Someone</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Many people comment on others’ appearances as a reflection of their own insecurities or societal conditioning,” said <a href=\"https://thriveworks.com/therapist/pa/monica-cwynar\">Monica Cwynar</a>, a licensed clinical social worker with Thriveworks. “This behavior often stems from a need to assert social dominance or align oneself with prevalent beauty standards. It often reveals a lack of self-awareness or acceptance and a reliance on external validation.”</p>\n<p>She emphasized that these kinds of comments can highlight deeper self-esteem issues and a desperate need for approval.</p>\n<p>“Our culture is shaped heavily by white supremacy, capitalism and patriarchy, which trains us to evaluate and rank people visually before anything else,” said mental health therapist <a href=\"https://livinglotustherapy.com/\">Panicha McGuire</a>. “Beauty standards rooted in whiteness, thinness, youth and able-bodiedness are held up as the ‘ideal,’ so people internalize the compulsion to comment on appearance as a way of sorting who is ‘valuable’ and who is not.”</p>\n<p>So while the impulse might seem casual or even harmless, this habit tends to reflect bigger cultural forces and personal anxieties ― making appearance-focused remarks less about the person being observed and more about the speaker’s internalized values and struggles.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it’s an awkward attempt at connection, but often it reveals insecurity, bias or a worldview where worth is tied to conformity with those dominant standards rather than to substance or someone’s character,” McGuire said.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>How Trump’s Fixation On Looks Affects Society And Culture At Large</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“When public figures focus on appearance, they reinforce superficial values within society,” Cwynar said. “When it comes from our leaders, the impact has more gravitas, especially when it is delivered from men about women and their appearance. This behavior can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, create a culture that prioritizes looks over abilities or character and normalize objectification.”</p>\n<p>She believes this phenomenon is evident in the decreased self-esteem among teens today, which she linked to the high value placed on looks on social media and TV.</p>\n<p>“It sends a message that self-worth is contingent upon appearance, influencing how individuals perceive themselves and others,” Cwynar said. “The broader cultural implications include increased anxiety, body image issues and a relentless pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.”</p>\n<p>There’s an even more sinister impact to this kind of rhetoric from world leaders as well.</p>\n<p>“When leaders do this, it reinforces a culture of dehumanization,” McGuire said. “It tells us that the most important thing about a person is whether they fit a narrow ideal of beauty or masculinity. It also distracts from accountability, policy and real issues by keeping the conversation shallow.”</p>\n<p>By centering specific values, this kind of leadership sends a message that those who deviate from those norms should be reduced, ridiculed or erased.</p>\n<p>“It erodes empathy when we reduce people down to their appearance,” said licensed therapist <a href=\"https://www.joshuaterhunecounseling.com/\">Joshua Terhune</a>. “To make matters worse, it also influences younger generations to do the same thing. I’ve even seen montages on social media of Trump insulting others’ and people think it’s funny. It’s dehumanizing.</p>\n<p>And in the case of the Trump administration, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/style/trump-cabinet-looks-strategy.html\">the focus on appearance</a> seems to have led to placing highly unqualified and even potentially dangerous people in powerful governmental roles. </p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>How This Habit Affects Us As Individuals</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Focusing on appearances significantly impacts how we view others and ourselves, fostering a superficial understanding of relationships and leading to bias,” Cwynar said. “All of this is having a monumental impact on our mental health. Looking oneself in the mirror can be hard enough; then looking at oneself through an unrealistic prism doesn’t help as we need to make space for everyone.”</p>\n<p>She emphasized focusing on achieved, rather than ascribed characteristics in people and noted how identity factors like gender, race, socioeconomic status play into the way appearance is perceived and criticized.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-comment-appearances-habit_n_68cacaace4b0635bf8b66b72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She’s been stubborn, very dumb, manipulative, and made some very ill-advised decisions (so many!), but she’s also been a complex, messy, refreshing, and realistic portrait of a young girl trying to find herself. And unlike Joey and Lyla, she’s not white.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29au/video/7532415847105580309\">Lola Tung</a>has played Belly with the depth and nuance characters of color often don’t get on teen shows like this. While</p>\n<p><i>is still very white, Tung and her TV family (including</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sean.kauf/?hl=en\">Sean Kaufman</a>as Belly’s brother Steven and</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anotherjackiechung/?hl=en\">Jackie Chung</a>as mom Laurel) brought a dynamic that felt deeply real and aggressively normal, which, again, for</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/01/187984/asian-actress-representation-kelly-marie-tran\">Asian American characters onscreen</a>, this kind of representation is still rare and a welcome change. And it means that Tung’s Belly means a lot to a lot of people.

And in the series finale, Belly’s complexity was on full display. If you are, like Bock and me, less concerned with the love triangle between the Fisher boys (don’t get me wrong, I was still deeply invested) and more interested in watching our girl grow up and choose herself,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-recap-season-3-episode-11-at-last-tsitp.html\">Season 3 episode 11</a>was for us.</p>\n<p><i>The Summer I Turned Pretty</i>is getting a movie to wrap up Belly’s story, but for now, we have an ending.

And that’s how Conrad knows Belly. It’s a pivotal scene not just because it says out loud what we, the audience, already know to be true about Belly, but also because it gives Conrad a moment to gush about his girl.

Later, when she and Conrad are at her birthday party with her Parisian friends, they are recounting their lore. It makes for a nice rehash narratively, but it’s also realistic. If I were Belly’s friends, I’d definitely want the tea on the wedding she called off to one brother because she was in love with the other. Benito (who, we learn, is definitely not Belly’s boyfriend anymore) calls Conrad out for being the villain of their story. “If anyone was the villain, it was me,” Belly says.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><h1>My Trip to Portugal Reminded Me: I Deserve Luxury</h1><p>Photo Courtesy of Sandy Pierre</p><p>Portugal has always been on my bucket list. I heard about the food that stays with you long after the last bite, the incredible views, the good vibes, and how affordable it is once you’re there. So when the opportunity finally came to close out my summer with a trip to </p><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary-porto-portugal-software-developer-salary\">Portugal</a>, it felt like the perfect alignment.<p>I’ve always said I want to live a luxurious life, and this trip was exactly that. September is hands down the best time to visit Portugal. The weather is still gorgeous, the crowds have died down, and the energy feels calm but vibrant.</p><p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The trip started on a high note with a first class flight on Delta. I got to experience their </p><a href=\"https://news.delta.com/delta-one-lounge-new-york-jfk-ushers-new-era-premium-travel-airline\">Delta One lounge</a>for the first time, which felt like a warm up for everything to come: amazing food, a wellness treatment, and A1 service even before boarding. By the time I landed in Lisbon, I felt like I had already been on vacation for a day.<p>In Lisbon, I wanted to feel like a local, so I stayed at <br/></p><a href=\"https://www.lockeliving.com/en/lisbon/locke-de-santa-joana\">Locke de Santa Joana</a>, an apartment-style boutique hotel right in the middle of everything. It was chic, central, and gave me that “I live here” energy I wanted.<p>Photo Courtesy of Eshama John</p><p>Lisbon itself blew me away. The city is colorful, busy, and alive, but what really stood out was the Black community. Lisbon has deep African roots, and as a </p><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marbella-travel-review-black-women-abroad\">Black traveler,</a>I felt both safe and welcomed. People were friendly, warm, and quick to make me feel at home. And the food? Top tier. I had some of the best roasted chicken I’ve ever had in my life there. I also had tons of wine. My absolute favorite white wine,<a href=\"https://fioafiowines.com/en/wines/white-wine/fio-a-fio-vinho-verde-white-2024\">Fio A Fio</a>, comes from Portugal. Which makes sense, because they're famous for their wine!<p>One thing about me, I’m going to pack a </p><i>look</i>. I had outfits for every day and every occasion, but I also knew comfort had to come first. Lisbon is a walking city, so dresses, pants, and sneakers were my go-tos. Unless you plan on hopping in Ubers everywhere, leave the heels at home.<p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><p>For the second half of my trip, I rented a car and drove two hours south to Algarve. If Lisbon is the city girl, Algarve is her chill little sister who lives by the beach. It was everything I needed after days of exploring.</p><p>I checked into the </p><a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/faoaa-the-westin-salgados-beach-resort-algarve/rooms/\">Westin Salgados Beach Resort,</a>which had just opened this summer, and it was stunning.

This paves the way for the smallest on-chip motors in history, which can fit inside a strand of hair.</p>\n    <p>Gears are everywhere - from clocks and cars to robots and wind turbines. For more than 30 years, researchers have been trying to create even smaller gears in order to construct micro-engines. But progress stalled at 0.1 millimeters, as it was not possible to build the drive trains needed to make them move any smaller.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from Gothenburg University, among others, have now broken through this barrier by ditching traditional mechanical drive trains and instead using laser light to set the gears in motion directly.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Gears powered by light</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In their new study, the researchers shows that microscopic machines can be driven by optical metamaterials - small, patterned structures that can capture and control light on a nanoscale. Using traditional lithography, gears with an optical metamaterial are manufactured with silicon directly on a microchip, with the gear having a diameter of a few tens of micrometers. By shining a laser on the metamaterial, the researchers can make the gear wheel spin. The intensity of the laser light controls the speed, and it is also possible to change the direction of the gear wheel by changing the polarization of the light.</p>\n    <p>The researchers are thus close to creating micromotors.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>A new way of thinking </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\"We have built a gear train in which a light-driven gear sets the entire chain in motion. The gears can also convert rotation into linear motion, perform periodic movements and control microscopic mirrors to deflect light,\" says the study's first author, Gan Wang, a researcher in soft matter physics at the University of Gothenburg.</p>\n    <p>The ability to integrate such machines directly onto a chip and drive them with light opens up entirely new possibilities. Since laser light does not require any fixed contact with the machine and is easy to control, the micromotor can be scaled up to complex microsystems.</p>\n    <p>\"This is a fundamentally new way of thinking about mechanics on a microscale. By replacing bulky couplings with light, we can finally overcome the size barrier,\" says Gan Wang.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Cell size</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>With these advances, researchers are beginning to imagine micro- and nanomachines that can control light, manipulate small particles or be integrated into future lab-on-a-chip systems. A gear wheel can be as small as 16-20 micrometers, and there are human cells of that size. Medicine is a field that is within reach, believes Gan Wang.</p>\n    <p>\"We can use the new micromotors as pumps inside the human body, for example to regulate various flows. I am also looking at how they function as valves that open and close.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Story Source:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Materials provided by <strong>University of Gothenburg</strong>. <i>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.</i></p>\n    <p><strong>Journal Reference</strong>:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Gan Wang, Marcel Rey, Antonio Ciarlo, Mahdi Shanei, Kunli Xiong, Giuseppe Pesce, Mikael Käll, Giovanni Volpe. <strong>Microscopic geared metamachines</strong>.<i>Nature Communications</i>, 2025; 16 (1) DOI:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62869-6\">10.1038/s41467-025-62869-6</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Cite This Page</strong>:</p>\n    <p><i>ScienceDaily</i>.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>In no community is “to each their own” more true than the beauty coterie. I know that if you don't <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/bob-haircut\">get a bob</a> right after I get bob, it's not because you don't like my bob—it's because you just prefer longer hair for yourself. And while I know plenty of people who insist on a squared-off nail shape, it's just never been for me. I prefer the softer look of an oval or almond shape, especially if there's a French manicure involved. But <strong>Demi Lovato</strong> might have just recruited me to the square side with what her nail tech is calling the “micro straight French.”</p>\n    <p>Lovato is getting the word out about her upcoming ninth studio album, <i>It's Not That Deep</i>, and that includes bopping around New York City during New York Fashion Week. The singer was spotted in a variety of devastatingly cool outfits, like a red long-sleeve top and low-slung black pants, and a belted, ribbed, burgundy catsuit. But just in case you couldn't quite zoom in enough to get a close-up of her equally awesome nails, her go-to nail artist, Natalie Minerva, is happy to oblige.</p>\n    <p>In a new <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOuqLq9jrH8/\">Instagram carousel</a>, we get a clear look at a totally fresh take on how to do a French manicure on squoval nails (square nails with a bit of softness on the edges). Whereas French manicures typically curve along the edge of the nail down to the cuticle—even when it's done on square nails—Lovato's micro tips are painted straight across.</p>\n    <p>And those straight little tips make a big impact in the prettiest metallic shade, a chrome-like platinum sitting atop a combination of OPI For the Fill of It Nail Builder Gel and OPI Pearl Clutching Behavior, which is available as a <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/cpMzueKu8Cceqze8t6QiM9kzcaRtThCQyjwTQoUuQi5nQMnKzUf2tpe15zJgyBp8zeEZfWTbbG62bojkjpvQBAtrWQeT18c21fAFdid8nwdrmBRdxhRfXvwJBnzojePkDRChpsSk3KbkFoPMfq5iswNqEuVWoXQq1ekNBQxN8PiofANXDJqoYzPCxxHEb4oPLascXpGDsw59BMxUBjo935meSq66sMjfnAX3jEBLEuaH6HnDMFxM6iJTseRNvais7ZFwzEge2eSDRzBN5dPZ4kagsMTsSnpAT6J73ge3438cE9DiSdAxBmv16T9k5KfUXeT2LM2EaXbXAGpp25dqy6NzMr7K3Tgkbsjzbsx7rS1qpKZBv78quPeFQJ\">non-gel polish as well</a>.</p>\n    <p>As soon as I saw this, my entire brain chemistry shifted and my mind suddenly opened up to the possibility of not-oval nails and not-curved French manicures. But if you're still Team Oval, don't worry—this pretty silver streak will look just as lovely as a curved tip.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>More nail art news:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/lisa-pink-princess-nails-emmys-2025\">Lisa's Pink Princess Emmys Manicure Is Out of This World</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/julia-fox-carnival-funhouse-3d-nail-art\">Julia Fox's Carnival Funhouse Nail Art Is a Total Trip</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/kylie-jenner-hailey-bieber-fall-nail-colors-tiktok\">Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber Have Two Very Different Approaches to Fall Nail Colors</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Now, check out Selena Gomez's  Allure cover shoot:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><i>Follow</i> Allure <i>on</i> <i>Instagram</i><i>and</i> <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@allure?lang=en\">TikTok</a>, or<i>subscribe to our newsletter</i><i>to stay up to date on all things beauty.</i></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/demi-lovato-micro-straight-french-manicure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

If my hair is looking a little dull after drying, I'll add one more pump once I'm finished styling.”<strong>—Kassidy Silva, social director</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More to know</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Key ingredients:</strong>jasmine oil, argan oil</li>\n      <li><strong>Hair it's best for:</strong>all hair types</li>\n      <li><strong>When to apply:</strong>damp or dry hair</li>\n      <li><strong>Additional benefits:</strong>repairing split ends</li>\n      <li><strong>Scent:</strong>bergamot, sandalwood, jasmine</li>\n      <li><strong>Sizes:</strong>1.7 oz, 3.4 oz</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2><strong>Best for Shine:</strong> Aveda Miraculous Oil</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> Aveda’s Miraculous Oil High-Shine Hair Concentrate is giving “glass skin” but in hair form. It harnesses tsubaki seed oil, a K-beauty favorite that’s hand-harvested from Korea’s Jeju Island, to deliver next-level smoothness and shine. Cold-pressed to preserve its nutrients, the oil deeply nourishes and softens strands without any heat or chemicals. Daikon seed oil tames flyaways while adding a weightless slip, and oil fermented from the cemelina plant packs omega-3, 6, and 9 fatty acids for hair that catches the light from every angle. Just a pump or two transforms locks into sleek, silky strands.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tester feedback from  Allure commerce writer  Lily Wohlner</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>“This oil is a game-changer for finer hair that easily looks weighed down with too much product. Lightweight yet hydrating, it targets flyaways, taming my naturally frizzy strands after a blowout, and it's my go-to topper whenever I need a sleek, polished finish.” <strong>—Lily Wohlner, commerce writer</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>More to know</strong>\n    </p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Key ingredients:</strong>tsubaki seed oil, daikon seed oil, camelina oil ferment</li>\n      <li><strong>Hair it's best for:</strong>all hair types</li>\n      <li><strong>When to apply:</strong>damp or dry hair</li>\n      <li><strong>Additional benefits:</strong>smooths flyaways, doubles as a heat protectant</li>\n      <li><strong>Scent:</strong>lavender, ylang-ylang, petitgrain</li>\n      <li><strong>Sizes:</strong>1.7 oz</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2><strong>Best for Damaged Hair:</strong> K18 Molecular Repair Hair Oil</h2>\n<p><strong>Why it's worth it:</strong> A winner in the Splurge category of the 2023 Best of Beauty Awards, K18's Molecular Repair Hair Oil works to address frizz on two levels: first, by reversing structural damage caused by heat styling and salon treatments through the brand’s namesake K18 peptide, and second, by conditioning hair with natural lipids, like avocado and sunflower oils.</p>\n<p>Whatever your hair concerns, <a href=\"https://warrentricomi.com/artist/lazaro/\">Lazaro Lambertucci</a>, a New York City-based hairstylist and colorist, confirms that the K18 Molecular Repair Hair Oil is \"weightless and amazing for all hair types.” (Not just damaged!) It also helps prevent <i>future</i> damage by providing heat protection up to 450 degrees. This multitasking oil can be applied to damp hair before styling or used as a finishing oil.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tester feedback from  Allure former commerce writer  Jennifer Hussein</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/gallery/best-hair-oils\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

There are many different forms when it comes to the popular amino acid chains. But according to experts, “Peptides are the building blocks of proteins, which are structural components of cells, hormones, and enzymes,” explains dermatologist <a href=\"https://pacificskin.com/dr-tracy-evans\">Tracy Evans</a>. Those building blocks are then absorbed into the skin, where they perform their skin reparative magic. Some eye cream formulas contain one, while others contain multiple.

This time around, the trick <i>was </i>the sleeves.</p>\n    <p>The actor was spotted in New York City on Wednesday afternoon, where she was a sight for sore eyes in a primary-colored fit that brought some technicolor to the overcast New York City streets.</p>\n    <p>Color-wise, Holmes stuck with the basics: red, yellow, and blue. But while her outfit might have seemed pretty standard upon first glance, there was really nothing basic about it.</p>\n    <p>The highlight was a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanteros.com%2Fproducts%2Flief%3Fvariant%3D42319895527537\">butter yellow Lief dress shirt</a> from the Anteros (which is sadly sold out). This shirt added pizzazz to Holmes’s ensemble thanks to its elongated sleeves, which featured slits up the sides. Thanks to this detail, not only were Holmes’s arms able to peek out, but the cuffs billowed in a beautifully dramatic flare whenever the wind caught them.</p>\n    <p>Of course, while the sleeves might’ve been the real showstopper, there was plenty to feast upon with the rest of the look, too. For her jeans, the <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/katie-holmes-patchwork-jeans-happy-hours-set-behind-the-scenes/\">Happy Hours </a><a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/katie-holmes-patchwork-jeans-happy-hours-set-behind-the-scenes/\">director</a> chose a set of two-tone Levi’s, which came in a regular wash with a light wash trim outlining the sides and bottom hem.</p>\n    <p>Finally, she completed the look with a set of candy red accessories, including a pair of bright, ballerina flats, and a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feu.metier.com%2Fproducts%2Fprivate-eye-buttery-nappa-pomodoro\">Private Eye leather handbag</a> from Métier.</p>\n    <p>Over the years, I’ve learned many things from examining Holmes’s style. She loves <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/katie-holmes-purple-skirt-mustard-velvet-flats-red-bag/\">red handbags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/katie-holmes-hot-pink-heels-ivory-suit/\">quirky footwear</a>. She can <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/katie-holmes-fall-winter-style-shopping-guide/\">stack with the best of ’em</a> and make a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/katie-holmes-leather-slipdress-cutouts/\">slip dress look like a ballgown</a>.

The former <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a62649491/zayn-malik-niall-horan-harry-styles-louis-tomlinson-liam-payne-tributes/\">One Direction</a> member and current coach on <i>The Voice </i>has been linked to Amelia Woolley since 2020, and she’s since become an important presence in his life and his music.</p>\n    <p>Here’s everything to know about Woolley and her relationship with Horan.</p>\n    <h2>They were first linked in 2020.</h2>\n    <p>Reports surfaced in July 2020 that Horan was seeing Woolley during the early months of the pandemic. A source told <i> Daily Mail</i> at the time, “Niall is very serious about Amelia; lockdown has definitely intensified his feelings for her,” and that “Niall has been seeing Amelia for the last two months.”</p>\n    <p>“He thinks Amelia’s gorgeous, but they also really get on,” the source added. “She’s told close friends this could be the real deal.”</p>\n    <p>The insider also revealed how they met: “They met in London as Amelia works for shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood and moved to Kensington for her job.”</p>\n    <h2>They made their first public appearance in 2021.</h2>\n    <p>The couple kept their relationship private for over a year before stepping out publicly. In September 2021, Woolley <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/niall-horan-and-amelia-woolley-make-first-public-appearance-together-171530\">attended</a> Horan’s charity event, the Horan &amp; Rose Gala, in Hertfordshire.

The singer confirmed to <i> NME</i> in April 2023 that his track “You Could Start a Cult” was inspired by their relationship. “I watch a lot of true crime with my girlfriend,” he explained. “I just wrote it down one night when we were watching something, because it’s a big thought. I thought it was funny initially: You could literally start a cult, and I’d follow you into the fire. It started as a joke and became this really sweet song; it is funny.” </p>\n    <h2>They’ve attended high-profile events together.</h2>\n    <p>Though they mostly keep their romance off social media, the couple has appeared together at major events over the years. They were <a href=\"https://x.com/adoresnflwr/status/1538645283659100161\">seen</a> at Harry Styles’s Wembley Stadium concert in 2022, attended the French Grand Prix that summer, and enjoyed a vacation in Mexico in January 2022, per <i> Daily Mail</i>.</p>\n    <p>Most recently, they made <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/niall-horan-and-amelia-woolley-enjoy-rare-public-wimbledon-date/\">headlines</a> when they were photographed at Wimbledon in July 2025. Horan and Woolley sat courtside for the men’s final.</p>\n    <h2>They’ve settled into a home together.</h2>\n    <p>After several years of dating, Horan and Woolley reportedly bought a six-bedroom home in London in 2025. A source told <i> The Sun UK</i>, “Niall loves traveling and touring, but this is him really laying down his roots with his new home with Mia.”</p>\n    <p>The source added that the house felt like “a proper family home.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a67949726/who-is-amelia-woolley-niall-horan-girlfriend/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With this in mind, we tapped <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro/directory\">AD PRO Directory designers</a> to weigh in on what to look for in a duvet cover to elevate your bedroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Material:</strong> When it comes to duvet covers, everyone has their own personal preferences. For <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro/directory/profile/bnr-interiors\">Nicole R. Fisher</a>, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://www.bnrinteriors.com/\">BNR Interiors</a>, it's linen: “They’re effortless, lightweight, and airy. I think the simplicity of the linen transcends different styles and spaces,” she says. Fisher notes that the feel is a big factor when selecting a duvet cover.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro/directory/profile/aquilo-interiors\">Carmen René Smith</a>, founder and principal designer of <a href=\"https://www.aquilointeriors.com/\">Aquilo Interiors</a>, says that it also needs to feel soft to the touch, breathable, and cozy. “What’s the point of a beautiful duvet if you don’t want to snuggle into it?” she says. “Texture is key too—whether it’s silky, crisp, or nubby, it should add depth to the space.”</p>\n<p><strong>Comfort:</strong> All of the interior designers we spoke to for this story point to natural fibers, not only because of their quality but also their airflow and breathability. <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro/directory/profile/shelbie-cox-studio\">Shelbie Cox</a> of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shelbiecoxstudio\">Shelbie Cox Studio</a> recommends natural fibers like organic cotton and linen and notes that polyester and other synthetic fibers are best to avoid since they tend to trap heat.</p>\n<p><strong>Design:</strong> With so many patterns and colors to choose from, it’s important to keep your bedroom’s design style in mind. If you like more of a minimalist bedroom, Cox suggests a fine stripe pattern (like <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/TSeEb3zLmLvAw3HJNCMEK7uFgxGu261vXLwkGXDq2w3iWnusdmDAw8PptHaPjsqAvaDVa2DnzTHqHQHiYWaGBV6wwwYdQwVwSCbnTCFEfEuQ9dRsJ9pDzzv3HzhQ2mKkxiS1VpPdoA9LAjCKpCLGDYwVpv9HL3jwvz1qysuAvjwiFTLafHPzy8JSav1MM6iugMGawrih3yDwhEcLPh9uS1CgvJLhHrgjS6m9qoaaXZ654ecae5SyR1AK1jXdmsPn9wnRoV4JEcNDzhcpz51gsHW9nx8oJGy552cS1E1gL1hA3HXDzgrAfJ8gVypVr4aBGbH4TnPxJ6pBLcvfocxEvCQx155fmXq8T3F6dmZ2CkbYAfxTEGeXwpW843ZZTg9J3irki\">Quince’s European Linen Duvet Cover</a>) or a monochromatic, muted color palette (see the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/P5DkZRf1FvK8J8iBYjqE2E6BzrHCvaejx66imaJUW1sE4PJsN2PUWm6s5xQrizwBsjfP3KcGChSLZFw5X8MeB75kWgnqfouEQaEr2h4DpZC1ZjJkcE7jj3NWRz4LtwZNCy4qpJXAt3qqXQptXkSGq6DW31brN7bGtVhKbsEb7Cdvrh3g8BJqUvknxDp2x8Sar9LmckooNcTpAhuxUq2XrMxuat5g4M5yJwjfpLsSJbhVk8U3dPd7jvkdYCLvbAfWQbHooTqjfswCNuV9gkLzfYHRW1CUPgb67NsWfFhCZ3ufJmV4iwNgibboa86k1pTfVcAdSEe1n7Zcd5k7eJSbsZgRzrDHH1m46gkWh7Y\">Cozy Earth Linen Bamboo Duvet Cover</a>) for your duvet cover set.</p>\n<p>If you want to go bold for your bedroom, there are options aplenty. “We’re maximalists, so we say bump up the color and pattern no matter what your signature style is!” says Smith, adding that it’s important to still maintain balance. “If you have bold wallpaper, pull a color from it and go for a solid, textured duvet—like a rich velvet for drama or a soft linen for a more relaxed vibe. If you’re mixing patterns, think about scale—a bold, oversized print pairs best with a smaller, more delicate duvet pattern to give the eye a place to rest.”</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to commit to one style just yet, rest assured that having a few duvets in rotation can help you keep your bedroom design fresh. “I tend to go simple on bedding and let the accessories be the pops of pattern and color that’s easily swapped out,” adds Fisher.</p>\n<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> While these are great design accessories for a bedroom, they also need to be practical. <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/adpro/directory/profile/muse-noire-interiors\">Ashley Ross</a>, founder and principal designer of <a href=\"http://www.musenoire.com/\">Muse Noire Interiors</a> recommends keeping these questions in mind when shopping: How does it fasten (zipper, tie up, or buttons)? Does it fit within your washer and dryer? This will help you know how to use it and how to care for it. She’s also big into searching the web to see how easily people find the duvet cover is—or is not—to take off.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How We Tested the Best Duvet Covers</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-duvet-covers-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>All products featured on Architectural Digest are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.</p>\n    <p>Let it be known: Little ones (and others who may be afraid of the dark) aren’t the only people who enjoy using the best night lights out there. Anyone who needs to find their way around the house in the middle of the night—thirsty people, pet owners, parents, the jet-lagged, insomniacs, to name a few—would be delighted to find a dark hallway navigable with the soft glow of a night light. Plus, a shining piece of home decor can make falling asleep a dreamier experience all around. Illumination also looks nice in daylight hours, which is often the harder piece of the night-light puzzle to figure out.</p>\n    <p>We’ve rounded up some night lights with fun (and functional!) features—like color changes and dimmer switches. Some of them would fit in just as well as decor pieces in your hallway or living room, and many of them would make the best gifts. LED lamps even work to provide ambient light in environmentally-friendly ways thanks to their low-energy bulbs.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Our Top Picks</strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>In this Article</strong>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Best Red Night Light</h2>\n    <p>These orb-like plug-in night lights are particularly low-profile while still delivering a soft glow. The dusk to dawn sensor ensures these are always alight when you’re stumbling through the dark, and it makes them an energy efficient choice for your dim hallways. We’re partial to these, as they employ the same tech as our favorite <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-loftie-alarm-clock\">Loftie sunrise alarm clocks</a>. Added bonus: The red night light is designed to stimulate the production of melatonin—a hormone that can help you fall asleep—with red wavelengths.</p>\n    <h2>A Practical Night Light</h2>\n    <p>Less <i>cute</i> than some other options, maybe, but more pragmatic. This night light spares no accoutrements—it boasts adjustable brightness with a dimmer switch, it’s a compact plug-in with an LED bulb, and it has an automatic light sensor. It also disperses a soft white light unlike some of the harsher LED options on the market.</p>\n    <h2>Best All-In-One Night Light</h2>\n    <p>This sunrise alarm clock works double-duty as a night light (as does the <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/HqPtkHbE1vfvurfMYj5Mpnh9kpnLuCMBMspEjzrWnfjHx5XW1Atg9DzGU36GBLYkRsfLFrVXZn31tjqM41sYwq8KByiyCzgBaKWhrSUmkyC2pehX3JeNiViQ2SPnFs414eSDKpHSgKqHf6GzYLKkkQexvW15qTqHuTHCyLurVbdmdaGbMD2US7DRzeqX1WDGyaFgvcxjK8Wnh6THGecPV2LG34enWLyRTSSqC9quuT8dZUsMD7DxELsocBCgTkAWnMYnSfwQhrVTtaRMR5DBrUh3zehnTFMG8NW37mXGRefm75RRRCADPTgJEW\">Loftie</a>), and a white noise machine, making it an all-in-one bedside companion. You can adjust its brightness levels with touch controls, as well as adapt it to red light for deeper sleep.</p>\n    <h2>Best Design-Forward Night Light</h2>\n    <p>While not a night light per se, it’s one of the <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/best-table-lamps-and-bedside-lamps\">best table lamps</a> out there. Any time we can sneak Noguchi into a roundup, we do. This model is dimmable, so you can adjust the warm white light to suit your preference. We’d recommend making this your obligatory leave-this-on-all-night lamp in the living room. Maybe on top of a curated stack of <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/the-best-coffee-table-books-to-gift-design-enthusiasts-this-year\">art books</a>?</p>\n    <h2>Most Playful Night Light</h2>\n    <p>This is a night light for kids and adults alike, embodying the charming, playful characteristics of all <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6AeCGcpfTzQfzoNnnykbrsQYD4811WtoyePLNCw1ChUha8PL5GvS1E6MwHumG4FBQ7tdfvk34PJooiYngYZWfsNnBJFdr9EjjhsAqUs5dozSsjHKGwbAhvPNv3qR5s9qWaujXBy7FCmnzbUi1MFFt18x8QHtrt8g8hgVm5eNT7jrSrJD6PLDWr5BP2GRrmUFNN67NWpnPcgVnSA32gJkopnbsVfcxzeXk96MbYCaxR2Xwhkd9zyXmNNLZYJVLztRZVdHpuEDTGuzf3DEBXv3JFZZgHwyCrHS2q6izvQNebndL6\">Dusen Dusen</a> products. This LED night light also has a light sensor, so it will automatically turn on in dim environments. With red-and-blue and yellow-and-purple variations, we’re thinking one for the <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-style-kids-rooms\">kid’s room</a>, one for the <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/small-bathroom-ideas-for-a-brighter-breezier-space\">bathroom</a> (and another for our <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-decorate-bedroom\">bedroom</a>).</p>\n    <h2>Best Motion Sensor Night Light</h2>\n    <p>These motion sensor night lights come in four friendly colors and pack a punch—a built-in human infrared sensor and photosensitive sensor register activity and automatically turn off after 15 seconds. These battery-powered LED night lights last for an anticipated 50,000 hours, though their battery can’t be replaced, so you have to invest in a new one…every 50,000 hours (that’s 2,083 days, by the way).</p>\n    <h2>Other <i>AD</i>-Approved Night Lights</h2>\n    <p>There’s a plethora of shell night lights out there, but few look so contained as this from Pottery Barn. These shells look a bit like under-sea beacons of light, though actually they’re battery-charged and made of polyresin. The small lights can sit atop a <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-nightstands-and-bedside-tables\">nightstand</a>, an end table, or a <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-bookshelves\">bookshelf</a> for a late-night sense of direction.</p>\n    <p>This night light spares no features. Key qualities are the multicolor LED lights and sound machine functions (30 non-looping sounds, by the way). It’s also BPA-free and rechargeable, and you can set it to 45-minute, 90-minute or 8-hour increments to appease your little one (see: you) throughout the night.</p>\n    <p>Snoopy has been the comeback kid of the 2020s, though we suppose some might say he never left. He was never a night light, anyway. Now, thankfully, he is—in silicone LED night light form. He’s also wireless and portable, so he can don any bedside table sans outlet and smile gently over a sleeping angel—whether that’s your little one or you.</p>\n    <p>Dare we say this is the most precious on the list, and while it doesn’t have any of the bells and whistles night lights can have these days (white noise machines, motion sensors, remote controls), it performs exactly the task of a good night light—look cute and illuminate.</p>\n    <p>We’re sneaking another table lamp on here because it achieves exactly the anticipated need of a night light, which is a micro light source you don’t have to plug in and out, or turn on and off. These can also be used outdoors, in case you’re looking for something somewhat versatile. This model has three brightness settings, a rechargeable battery, and its silicone exterior makes it water-resistant.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-night-lights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.</p>\n    <p>Festive <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/pastel-halloween-decor-37506594\">Halloween decor</a> tends to take up a lot of room in your home — especially if you’re in a smaller space. From sprawling skeletons to large pumpkins, these things are not exactly trinkets you can prop up on a ledge. And if you’re living in a dorm or a small apartment, you can quickly feel like your <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/diy-halloween-ghosts-sherpa-fabric-37506335\">holiday decorations</a> are more like clutter rather than a fun way to celebrate the season.</p>\n    <p>I have just the solution: a Halloween lamp! Or any practical item you need to use every day that you can make a little more festive.</p>\n    <p>If you’re going the lamp route, HomeGoods is selling these awesome gold and silver bat-etched lamps for $16.99 each, according to a TikTok video from <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@4kmediaguy\"> @4kmediaguy</a>. These are also really cool if you like subtle Halloween decor, because the bat shapes are etched into the column (not actually a full lamp shaped like a bat). For more bold options, there are black, gold, and silver skull-shaped lamps for $19.99. </p>\n    <p>As with any lamp, you can customize your buy when you get home. Both of the metallic bases come with black lampshades, but you can easily switch those out and customize them to your desired color at home. You could go for a lighter cream shade if you have it, or whatever color you’ve got at home.</p>\n    <p>It doesn’t appear that you can find these online, so you’ll have to take a trip to your local HomeGoods to find these spooky lamps! If you prefer to order online or can’t scoop one up, we have three similar options for you that bring the Halloween vibes in a practical find.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/homegoods-halloween-bat-lamp-37508043?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Category%2FChannel%3A+main\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>As a longtime teacher, Shelly Gates never expected to leave the profession in favor of designing <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a65784880/best-college-dorm-room-design/\">college dorm rooms</a> full-time. For the past decade, she had taught fourth grade at the same school in Mississippi. Then, in 2020, she designed her middle daughter’s dorm at Mississippi State University. Naturally, the mom of three shared photos of the room on Facebook. </p>\n<p>“I got a lot of positive responses, and I thought, <i>That was so much fun. This would be a great little summer job for me</i>,” Gates says. “So I just decided to start doing some dorms, and it has really exploded.”</p>\n<p>That summer passion project began with designing five dorms, but soon the requests started rolling in, and she had to make a choice. “My husband said, ‘You need to either do this full-time or teach. If it doesn't work out, you can always go back to teaching,’” Gates says. “So that's what we've decided to do, and I could have never dreamed that it would have turned into this.”</p>\n<p>Gates stopped teaching last year and estimates she’s done between 12 and 15 dorm rooms this year, “which was a lot, might I add,” says the founder of <a href=\"https://www.marymargaretdesigns.com/\"> Mary Margaret Designs</a>, which is named after her two daughters. To help, she was able to bring on assistants and tap into her existing network, including a carpenter, seamstress, and handyman. “It definitely takes a village to get those dorm rooms together,” she adds.</p>\n<p>Based in Madison, Mississippi, Gates designs dorms at schools throughout the South. She’s also done consults for some students at more northern schools. “Dorms where I live, throughout the South, are a pretty normal thing to do,” she says. “A lot of my business is here just because, you know, girls see it and they know other girls are gonna have it, and so they reach out to me and then we go from there.”</p>\n<p>As soon as Gates books clients, she has the students send her a Pinterest board, TikToks, photos, and Instagram posts of their vision for the dorm. When working with roommates who might have different visions, she helps mesh their styles together. Whether she’s working on an individual room as part of a quad suite or on a typical shared dorm, Gates takes the students’ visions and brings them to life.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes what we end up doing is different than what they originally envisioned, but it's such a representation of the girls and their personalities,\" Gates says. \"It's so much fun to get to have them as part of the entire design process.”</p>\n<p>This year, Gates noticed many girls gravitate toward florals. Beyond that shared appreciation, she’s seen a greater variety in <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g41613197/types-of-interior-design-styles/\">design styles</a> overall. “In the past, a lot of girls wanted pastels, but now it's all over the place,” Gates says, adding thats she’s done a ‘70s, butterfly-themed room, a Palm Beach-inspired oasis, and a largely black-and-white look. “They're expressing who they are, and that's what I love the most about it.”</p>\n<p>Since every experience is tailored to what the students and families want, they can have Gates do everything from concept to installation or solely tap her for design input. So for pricing, Gates says, “It's hard to give a firm number because so many people want so many different things.”</p>\n<p>On top of the service, one client may want an expensive fabric or an investment furniture piece that will alter the overall cost. But, Gates says, “There are so many ways to do a beautiful room without spending a bunch of money. I love bougie on a budget. I'm not going to like, I think that might be my gift in life.”</p>\n<p>While Gates has seen and <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a65566773/tasteful-dorm-decor-ideas/\">decorated many dorm rooms</a>, she admits there’s always a challenge in every single one. “I did a dorm this year in a dorm I had previously done, so it was not a new dorm to me—even went in, measured, did everything,\" she explains. \"Well, when we got in that particular room, our headboards wouldn't fit behind the beds because the beds are kind of built in. Now those headboards just fit in my other dorm there, but not this one, so we ended up having to saw the legs off the headboard to make it work.”</p>\n<p>Gates is constantly problem-solving and overcoming issues, from working around an awkward wall because of a window to pivoting because the ceiling is made of concrete and hard to hang things from.</p>\n<p>Apart from knowing to expect the unexpected, the designer’s best advice for anyone arranging and decorating a dorm room is to maximize the space you have as best as you can. “One of the things that I do is I loft the bed to 36 inches, which most college beds will do, then I use under the bed for so much storage,\" she says. \"Then, I cover it with a bed skirt. Even with the desks in the room, I usually push them together on one wall, and I cover those with a desk skirt.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/a66245599/dorm-room-designer-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Contemporary architecture often references ideals from modernism – canonical elements like clean lines, open plans, and material honesty – further tempered to suit current tastes and needs. This <a href=\"https://www.smitharc.com/beverly/\"> Highland Park residence</a>, designed by </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.smitharc.com\">with interiors by</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/tag/joshua-rice/\">, belongs firmly in that lineage. While expressing its modernist DNA, the home reconsiders what it means to be a “machine for living,” with an emphasis on how color, material, and built-in conveniences will impact a growing family. Far from the white, minimal “modern box” stereotype, this house proves that the subtleties of tone and texture can enhance modernism to create something sensual and moody.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The structure is set on the east side of Highland Park – one of Dallas’s most storied neighborhoods – positioning the location as a canvas for architectural experimentation. From early 20th-century Tudors and Mediterranean revivals to the later arrival of starkly contemporary projects, the neighborhood reflects a layered history of design. Building there is both a privilege and a challenge. But this new construction home, integrated into a difficult corner lot, respects the established visual narrative while offering something distinctly of its time.</p>\n<p>The architecture is anchored by gray limestone walls, a material chosen for both its durability and its sculptural quality. These walls flow between exterior and interior, creating a sense of continuity. Expanses of glass connect the family to the outdoors while raked wood panels and stucco soften the rigor of the stone. But the interiors are where the project most clearly establishes its voice. Rice builds on modernism’s lesser-known experiments with color by leveraging the hue derived from the very character of materials used.</p>\n<p>The interior palette ebbs and flows through 5,600 square feet with tones that are muted but never flat. Ceppo marble floors, fumed oak cabinetry, warm-gray laminates, and plaster matched to the architectural stone all bring depth and variation within a tightly edited spectrum. In the primary suite, natural white oak meets deep blue Japanese tile and Icelandic marble, combining warmth with shadow. Light oak wide-plank floors contrast with the darker elements, ensuring the atmosphere remains balanced.</p>\n<p>Programming is also central to the project’s success. From north to south, the home’s ground floor unfurls to reveal a wide range of spaces: a covered outdoor living area that spills into the kitchen and scullery; a partially sunken, open living and dining zone; and a well-dressed hallway leading to the primary suite, powder room, office, yoga studio, media room, mudroom, and laundry. The distinct, paneled-oak wall – designed in a racetrack shape – organizes the plan while discreetly enclosing private functions at the center of the home.</p>\n<p>Upstairs, a treetop family room anchors four children’s bedrooms, each an en suite, along with a second laundry to ease daily life. The arrangement reflects a contemporary sensibility: communal spaces flow into one another for family gatherings, while tucked-away rooms allow for quiet work, exercise, or retreat. The programming demonstrates that while the house pulls inspiration from modernism’s open plans or mid-century novelties, it adapts them to the complexities of raising a young family today.</p>\n<p>For Rice, the choice to embrace a darker, moodier palette was a deliberate challenge to prevailing expectations. In residential architecture, “modern” is often equated with bright, white, and minimal. Yet the designer understood that a palette grounded in shadow would create a calmer, more serene experience, given the abundant Texas daylight. The strategy was less about resisting the inundating rays and more about shaping them. Darker materials absorb and diffuse the sun, creating a sense of grounding that allows rooms to feel restful rather than overexposed.</p>\n<p>Rice does not treat color as an accent but as integral to architecture itself – something that emerges from the natural variations of stone, the smoked tones of oak, the mineral depth of tile. The palette is structural, not decorative.</p>\n<p>The furnishings further this dialogue between modernist lineage and contemporary sensibility. Instead of defaulting to the familiar icons of mid-century modern design, Rice curated a collection that blends rare vintage pieces with limited-edition works by contemporary designers. Sculptural lighting, carved wood chairs, and stone tables enrich the interiors with history and personality while remaining in harmony with the home’s muted chromatic atmosphere. Each piece contributes not only function but also a unique sense of self, reflecting the clients’ passion for the unexpected design.</p>\n<p>This house demonstrates how contemporary architecture can honor modernism without mere imitation. It draws from the movement’s clarity of space and truth to materials, but modifies those ideas for the realities of 21st-century family life. Albeit restrained, it reclaims the role of color – too often forgotten in the retelling of modernism’s history – as central to architecture’s emotional impact.</p>\n<p>“The clients are big fans of modern design but wanted something more unique and unusual than the typical design classics,” Rice says. “Luckily, that is my passion.”</p>\n<p>Here, color is not bold or loud, but quiet, grounding, and enduring. It is embedded in the limestone walls that define the house, in the marble veining beneath one’s feet, in the shadows that move across oak grain. This contemporary sanctuary proves that color in current architecture is far more impactful than the clichés of white walls and glass boxes. And that by returning to those roots, designers can craft homes that are as timeless as they are deeply personal.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/moody-tones-meet-mid-century-vibes-in-this-contemporary-texas-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Architect Takashi Yanai’s Los Angeles kitchen is the size of his clients’ walk-in closets. A partner at Ehrlich Yanai Rhee Chaney Architects (and a graduate of Harvard’s School of Design), Yanai, who was born in Japan and grew up in Santa Monica, oversee’s the firm’s residential projects: he’s a master at designing clean-lined California dream houses that are all about indoor-outdoor living.</p>\n    <p>His own recently remodeled 1950s ranch house, while much more modest in scope, is a microcosmos of the Yanai sensibility: Japanese formalism meets barefoot LA. We discovered Yanai’s place in <i>Creative Spaces</i>, the <a href=\"https://www.poketo.com/\">Poketo</a> team’s first book: see <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/posts/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-bungalow-los-angeles/\">LA Noir: Takashi Yanai’s Humble-Chic Bungalow</a>. Today, we’re returning to take a closer look at the kitchen and its lessons in spatial economics and understated style.</p>\n    <p>Photography by Ye Rin Mok, from <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/products/creative-spaces/\"> Creative Spaces</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-2-733x1100.jpg\" alt=\"yanai and his wife, architect patricia rhee (also a partner at eyrc specializin 17\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://eyrc.com/\">EYRC</a>specializing in civic and public spaces) and their two children have lived in their 1,500-square-foot house for eight years, and remained put while Yanai was transforming it—”we set up a temporary kitchen in the garage,” he tells us.</p>\n    <p>After stripping the living area to its bare bones, Yanai put up a partition finished with marine plywood that neatly divides the new kitchen from the living room. And in place of what had been a “tired suburban kitchen,” he installed a single-sided galley using components from top-of-the-line German modular cabinetry company Bulthaup. Yanai combined these with a back storage wall of marine plywood, which conceals the fridge. And because the family was in need of a place to work, instead of building in a table or island, he added a bookshelf and desk—a <a href=\"https://www.incollect.com/listings/furniture/case-pieces/peter-lovig-nielsen-danish-modern-teakwood-flip-top-table-desk-by-l-vig-of-denmark-209562\">Danish-modern teak flip-top design</a> by Peter Lovig Nielsen—and turned the other half of the room into a study. Yes, there’s also a dining table with a view (see below).</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-4-733x1100.jpg\" alt=\"the linoleum faced cabinets and stainless steel counter and sink are from bulth 18\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bulthaup.com/en-us/b3/\">B3</a>line. “I opted to go without any handles, so the space has a minimal, sculptural quality à la Donald Judd,” says Yanai. The faucet is by Fantini.</p>\n    <p>Yanai installed new custom windows—”simple apertures in the white walls, like picture frames, with no jamb details or trim”—and replaced 16 recessed ceiling lights with a few well-placed spotlights. He also stripped away all the moldings: “There isn’t even a backsplash. A deep window sill and ledge at the back of the counter is in marine plywood and integrates the Bulthaup cabinets with the custom plywood cabinets. The ledge is in lieu of a backsplash and is a great place for the most-used utensils and spices, and a few favorite objects and pictures.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/products/kalita-wave-1l-stainless-steel-drip-kettle-pot-silver/\">\n        <graphic decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-post-content wp-image-1337089\" src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-733x488.jpg\" alt=\"the family&amp;#8\\2\\17;s cutlery drawer is a model of order. their coffee pot,  19\" width=\"733\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-733x488.jpg 733w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-688x459.jpg 688w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-492x328.jpg 492w, https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6.jpg 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-6-733x488.jpg\" alt=\"the family&amp;#8\\2\\17;s cutlery drawer is a model of order. their coffee pot,  19\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.remodelista.com/products/kalita-wave-1l-stainless-steel-drip-kettle-pot-silver/\">Kalita Wave Drip Kettle,</a>and other coffee accessories rest on a wood tray from Muji.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.remodelista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/creative-spaces-poketo-takashi-yanai-kitchen-ye-rin-mok-photo-7-733x488.jpg\" alt=\" bulthaup&amp;#8\\2\\17;s b3 drawer inserts of aluminum, steel, and wood can be  20\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bulthaup.com/en-us/b3/equipment/\">B3 drawer inserts</a>of aluminum, steel, and wood can be arranged and rearranged.

They often came late at night, when Melinda Sicari, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman, was about to go to bed or already asleep, and the callers were persistent. They’d either just sent money for an apartment to a Zelle or Venmo account or were about to send it. But something made them call the broker they thought they’d been communicating with. “They would say something like, ‘I just applied for your apartment and sent you the deposit.’ Or ‘I know this is going to sound really weird, but …’”</p>\n<p>At first, Sicari, the top rental broker at Douglas Elliman, who leads a team of six other agents, assumed the callers were clients. “Oh, which apartment?” she’d ask. But the addresses they gave her didn’t exist, nor did the prices: $950 for a Soho studio, $2,500 for a loftlike two-bed, two-bath in Greenwich Village, a Gramercy one-bedroom in a luxury doorman building for $1,800 a month. It became clear that someone was posting ads all over TikTok and Instagram with her listing images and pretending to be her when someone inquired about them. Soon, she was getting four, five, sometimes ten calls a day. “It’s a scam,” she’d tell callers as soon as she could get a word in. Some of them would be embarrassed but relieved: “I knew it was too good to be true.” But those who had already sent money, sometimes much more than the $145 “application fee,” got upset. One man called her ten times in a row from different numbers, demanding she refund his money. Occasionally, people would show up at her midtown office. “One woman who was getting an apartment for her daughter flew in from Delaware,” Sicari told me. “She came to the office on a Saturday to pick up the keys.”</p>\n<p>Most of the scammers impersonating Sicari are savvy enough not to use her name or photo to set up their accounts on TikTok and Instagram, where she could more easily flag them and get them removed. Instead, the profiles have nondescript names like nyc_cozy_rental, unique_listings, and regulatedapartments, and they instruct prospective renters to contact them via WhatsApp or Telegram. That’s where they start posing as the broker. “My name is Melinda Sicari, a licensed real estate professional. Thank you for your concerns,” one wrote in a WhatsApp response to someone inquiring why they wouldn’t send her a link to the apartment listing. “My track record includes numerous successful deals and satisfied clients.” They sent a link to Sicari’s actual StreetEasy page. Often, they also include an image of a business card with all of Sicari’s real info — only the real-estate license number is fake. That’s often enough to satisfy the apartment hunters doing a quick Google search to confirm that Sicari is a real broker. I asked her how many people she’s been contacted by who’ve actually sent the scammers money. “Hundreds,” she told me.</p>\n<p>Most of the people losing money are out-of-towners, according to Sicari — often parents trying to lock down an apartment for their early-20-something kids who’ve been told they need to send in money <i>now</i>, or they’ll lose this great place. They may assume their kid has talked to someone on the phone instead of just on WhatsApp. Others may take the video tour as proof that an apartment is real, even though such tours are all over the internet, and it’s easy enough to lift a reel of a $15,000-a-month rental and slap on a new voice-over and a $2,200 price. Many out-of-towners are also, understandably, a bit out of touch with the New York City market — not knowing that the scam prices aren’t just good, but unreal, or that brokers don’t post reams of rent-regulated apartments to TikTok — you’re lucky if you stumble across one on StreetEasy, and they’re rarely in prime Manhattan neighborhoods where landlords have had every incentive to try and destabilize them over the years.</p>\n<p>But New Yorkers get scammed, too. After all, to land a great apartment, you have to be willing to put up with a certain amount of sketchiness: application fees that exceed the cost of a credit check (capped at $20 by law), handing over a “good faith” deposit to hold a place while your application is processed (illegal), paying a broker’s fee above 15 percent (quasi-legal), and offering more than the asking price (legal but completely demoralizing). It doesn’t help that the current rental market, which has continued to<a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/article/median-income-rent-studio-manhattan-275-square-feet.html\"> set records month after month</a>, is fertile ground for these types of cons. When you’ve spent weeks or months sifting through uninspiring, overpriced listings and a gem suddenly pops up, it can be hard not to reach out just to <i>see</i>. Several victims who’ve contacted Sicari are rental-voucher recipients, who often struggle to find apartments or brokers to work with them at all. (One TikTok scam account I came across claimed it was “Section 8 approved.”) And it’s not like renters have a lot of time to mull things over: You know you’re competing with parents with bigger bank accounts or tech bros making half a million a year who can offer above ask, so you scramble to send over your most sensitive information, from Social Security numbers to bank statements, to someone you’ve just met.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"http://www.curbed.com/article/scams-impersonate-brokers-online-tiktok-instagram-fraud.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=social_acct&utm_campaign=feed-part\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Each month, we’ll round up the best listings within commuting-ish distance, places where entire houses go for the cost of a “junior one-bedroom” (or less), but you’ll have to fix your own toilet.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>This month, we’ve got a former president’s hunting retreat in Hopewell Junction, and a restored Queen Anne cottage in Hudson. <strong> </strong></p>\n    <h2>FDR’s Hunting Retreat in Hopewell Junction</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/32-Tamarack-Dr-Hopewell-Junction-NY-12533/30095062_zpid/\">$1,550,000; five bedrooms, three-and-a-half bathrooms </a>\n    </p>\n    <p>A 1930 stone residence for the history buffs. Per the listing, Aymar Embury II, who handled a number of the Works Progress Administration projects in New York City, designed this home with stone from a local quarry as part of future Treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr.’s Fishkill Farms estate. FDR was a fan, and the spot became the president’s “favored” hunting retreat. It’s easy to see why, particularly with the grandeur of original timber beams and the stone mantel and fireplaces, as well as views of the mountains framed by Tudor-style windows. But it’s not fusty, with nice modern updates, particularly the Viking appliances in the kitchen. Upstairs, the second-floor primary suite comes with its own stone fireplace, while a clawfoot tub, office, and an additional room comprise the third-floor suite. There’s a heated saltwater pool and spa outside, plus plenty of trees and a creek scattered across the property’s 12 acres. It’s all very, well, presidential.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How do I get back to the city?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It’s a little over a one-and-a-half-hour drive.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>So what do I do if I live there?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>You’re a little under a 20-minute drive to Fishkill, and you can make some friends over bratwurst and tripels at the Dutchess Biercafe. Mount Beacon is just a smidge further for a hiking daytrip and dropping into the Hudson Valley Brewery after.</p>\n    <h2>A Nordic Barn in Round Top</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/listing/261-blackhead-mountain-road-round-top-ny-12473/1918264166178978377\">Two bedrooms, two bathrooms; $995,000</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>A spacious, barn-inspired new build that’s heavy on Scandinavian motifs. There’s white-oak flooring throughout, which plays well with the floor-to-ceiling windows that let in plenty of light and full views of the surrounding woodlands. Along with the two bedrooms, there’s a loft space with a skylight that is currently set up as a Pilates studio but could make for a meditation or indoor stargazing space, or a third bedroom to lure your friends still in the city up on the weekends. The kitchen has a built-in Wolf gas range and oven, plus custom cabinetry. In addition to the woodlands, the property’s 2.2 acres of outdoor space includes a kitchen, a built-in firepit and an outdoor shower, which helps if you’re into wading in the private creek.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How do I get back to the city?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It’s a roughly two-hour, forty-five-minute drive.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>So what do I do if I live there?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Make the seven-minute drive to nearby Cairo for croissants at Red Star Cafe &amp; Bakery; go camping at Whip-O-Will.</p>\n    <h2>A Very Hudson Valley Barn in Saugerties</h2>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Three bedrooms, three bathrooms; $1,550,000</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We’ve clearly got a thing for barns this month. This one, set on 13 acres of land, has a little more color, which perhaps partly could be chalked up to its 1980s build and the owners’ penchant for collecting. We’re fans of the airy, open-plan downstairs, which has a wood-burning fireplace in the living area and a nice flow between the custom kitchen and dining area. That, and the exposed beams lining the 18-foot ceilings. The primary ensuite bedroom and guest rooms are situated upstairs, as is a lounge with mountain views and custom shelving that could double as a library. Not too shabby.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How do I get back to the city? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It’s a little over a two-and-a-half-hour drive.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>So what do I do if I live there?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hit the trails at nearby Huckleberry Point, or make the roughly 15-minute drive into town to lounge with a latte at Josie’s Coffee Shoppe.</p>\n    <h2>A Restored 19th-Century Cottage in Hudson</h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bhsusa.com/for-sale/hudson-valley/columbia-county/hudson/445-447-union-street-hudson-ny-12534/907578-2325990\">Three bedrooms, two-and-a-half bathrooms; $1,435,000</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The restoration of this Queen Anne cottage preserved some of the building’s quaint, 1870s charm. The new floors and exposed beams are reclaimed old-growth Heart pine, and the custom kitchen is quite impressive, between the inset cabinetry, marble countertops, and brass hardware. The second-story porch, outfitted with shingled archways and accessible from two of the three bedrooms upstairs, is an ideal escape after emergency Zoom meetings. The yard, with a bluestone patio and perennials, is quite nice, as is the property’s detached carriage house that can host guests thanks to the full bathroom and custom kitchenette built with an antique farmhouse sink. There’s also this bonus: off-street parking in the rear.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>How do I get back to the city? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It’s a roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive, or two hours and 15 minutes via Amtrak.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>So what do I do if I live there?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>You’re right in the thick of Hudson, so grab a cozy and pull up to the bar at Spotty Dog Books &amp; Ale, or catch a show at the Time and Space Limited theater; also, there’s always antiquing on Warren Street.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"http://www.curbed.com/article/best-upstate-ny-listings-hopewell-junction-hudson-saugerties.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=social_acct&utm_campaign=feed-part\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We all know that one co-worker who swears their 5 a.m. green juice is the secret to life. Meanwhile, others are just hoping the last bus shows up on time. But research keeps nudging us toward a middle ground: small, precious habits and mindsets that turn the daily grind into something closer to jet fuel than burnout.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.success.com/this-7-step-morning-routine-helped-me-build-a-billion-dollar-brand/\">Daily routines</a> aren’t new—they trace all the way back to humanity’s earliest days. From ancient rituals to modern self-help, people have always searched for ways to bring greater rhythm and meaning into their days. We tend to picture routines as rules or control, but that’s a misconception. <a href=\"https://americanbehavioralclinics.com/the-science-of-happiness-how-small-daily-habits-improve-mental-health/\">Studies</a> suggest the most valuable routines are the ones filled with moments that bring happiness, balance and energy, not just order.</p>\n<h2><strong>The morning blueprint for a happier, more productive day</strong></h2>\n<p>Not everyone is a <a href=\"https://www.success.com/the-simple-secret-to-productive-mornings/\">morning person</a>, but there’s something in all of us that values a fresh start. Each new day allows us to reframe our goals, our mindset and our surroundings. For many, that sense of how the day will unfold starts almost immediately. In fact, recent findings from <a href=\"https://talkerresearch.com/morning-routines-strongly-impact-how-the-rest-of-the-day-goes/\">Talker Research</a> show that 37% of Americans can predict whether their day will be good or bad within just 10 minutes of waking, long before they’ve had coffee or showered. </p>\n<p>The moments just after waking are prime for a slow, deliberate start. Giving your mind time to awaken and your brain a chance to gradually engage helps you approach the day’s responsibilities with clarity. Jumping into high-pressure tasks too quickly can signal to your mind that the day will be turbulent and stressful.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.jimrohn.com/2023-jrwok-library\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.success.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jim-Rohn-WOK_CTA_r1@2x.png\" alt=\"Jim Rohn Wealth of Knowledge Bundle offer\"/></a></p>\n<p>A “slow morning,” as it’s called, has become a staple for many high-profile professionals who face constant pressure and relentless schedules. It’s the part of the day they can spend without deadlines or notifications, letting their minds and bodies gently wake up.</p>\n<p>Amazon CEO <a href=\"https://simranjotsinghsran.medium.com/the-surprising-morning-habit-that-turned-jeff-bezos-into-a-billionaire-and-could-transform-your-918acf255fec#:~:text=Studies%20show%20people%20who%20rush,tips%2C%20or%20skip%20due%20diligence.\">Jeff Bezos</a> is one of the most vocal advocates of this practice. He credits his morning routine—free of early meetings and rushed obligations—for allowing him to make some of the most important decisions in his career, emphasizing that a calm start sets the tone for creativity and clarity throughout the day. Typically, Bezos wakes up naturally without an alarm, enjoys a healthy breakfast with his family and spends time thinking through priorities before rushing into anything demanding. </p>\n<p>Mindfulness is key to a slow morning: postponing phone checks, avoiding news and refraining from tasks that could overburden your early-morning brain.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why pausing pays off: Microbreaks that make a difference</strong></h2>\n<p>Even a well-planned routine can feel draining if there’s no reward for effort. Giving yourself brief, enjoyable pauses throughout the day, whether it’s a leisurely trip to the coffee shop after a meeting, a short walk outside or simply taking a few mindful breaths at your desk, engages your brain’s natural reward system. Research shows that these intentional <a href=\"https://www.success.com/4-ways-to-incorporate-microbreaks-into-your-work-from-home-routine/\">microbreaks</a> keep your energy levels high and make your day feel less like a grind and more like a series of wins. </p>\n<p>Self-rewarding is quickly becoming a must-have strategy for today’s workers, according to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388325558_THE_ROLE_OF_SELF-REWARD_IN_BOOSTING_PERFORMANCE_AND_MENTAL_WELL-_BEING_FOR_REMOTE_GENERATION_Z_WORKERS\">study</a> published this January. For those working remotely, the lack of everyday office interactions like quick chats, casual laughs or just being around people can make it tough to stay motivated. The research shows that small, intentional acts of <a href=\"https://www.success.com/how-to-reward-yourself/\">self-reward</a> aren’t just nice-to-haves anymore; they’re essential for keeping your energy, focus and overall well-being intact in the digital age. </p>\n<p>These rewards come in many shapes and sizes. You might enjoy something physical, like a favorite snack; an emotional boost, such as taking time to relax or celebrate a win; a social reward, like sharing your success with friends or colleagues; a mental reward, including reflecting on progress or planning your next steps; or a spiritual lift, through practices like meditation, gratitude or other soul-soothing rituals. Whatever helps you stay focused and grateful is worth taking a moment for, even if it feels indulgent. These small joys fuel your energy and keep your drive alive.</p>\n<h2><strong>Power through without burning out: Staying sharp during your most intense work</strong></h2>\n<p>Not all work is comfortable or predictable. Sometimes it’s messy, intense and exhausting. And, yet, those are often the moments when our minds shine brightest, producing ideas and solutions we wouldn’t have found otherwise.</p>\n<p>Appreciate the grind for what it is: a sign you’re pushing boundaries, stretching your skills and creating something meaningful. When you fully commit to the hard work, you tap into a flow of energy and clarity that only comes from giving it your all. There’s something exhilarating about the challenge itself, and embracing it can turn even the most overwhelming moments into a source of pride and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>While it might sound surprising, science has explored this phenomenon in depth. Psychologists and neuroscientists refer to it as a positive stress response or “eustress”—a form of stress that, unlike chronic or overwhelming stress, can actually enhance performance, focus and motivation.</p>\n<p>Moderate levels of challenge trigger the body’s stress response just enough to increase alertness, boost cognitive function and heighten energy, without tipping into burnout. When your brain perceives a task as demanding but achievable, it releases adrenaline and cortisol in controlled doses, sharpening attention and preparing you to perform at your best. Remember: Positive stress works best when the challenge is achievable, not paralyzing.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.success.com/daily-routine-hacks-for-energy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Everyone has a podcast now,” during a recent interview with comedian Jeff Ross on his SiriusXM satellite radio broadcast.</p>\n<p>And podcast analytics seem to show that indeed, there are lots of podcasts out there.</p>\n<p>The Podcast I<a href=\"https://podcastindex.org/\">ndex</a> estimates that worldwide there are more than 4 million registered podcasts, or podcasts that appear in directories and platforms, such as Apple or Spotify, allowing people to discover them and listen.  </p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/youtube-is-the-preferred-podcast-listening-service/\">Edison</a> Podcast Metrics, a service which tracks actual listening and not just downloads across all platforms, shows and networks, the three most popular podcast listening platforms are YouTube, Spotify and Apple Podcasts, respectively. </p>\n<p>Further, the latest research from <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/786826/podcast-listeners-in-the-us/\">Statista</a> says that nearly 160 million Americans listen to podcasts every month.</p>\n<p>It would appear that there is a plethora of, if not too many, podcasts out there to accomplish basic goals such as generating revenue or gaining exposure for a product, service or cause.</p>\n<h2><strong>Is the podcast landscape truly saturated? </strong></h2>\n<p>Both podcasters and media experts and producers have mixed opinions on whether or not the medium is now saturated.</p>\n<p>“Not at all—though it may feel that way,” says Doug Downs, director at Stories and Strategies, a podcast agency. He points to a statistic that states that as of May, fewer than 400,000 podcasts had been published in the past 30 days. “While total shows are in the millions, the active universe is much smaller. That means the vast majority are dormant—walking-dead zombie shows with no new content.”</p>\n<p>He adds that for people who produce consistent, quality episodes, “there’s massive opportunity—especially in underserved niches.”</p>\n<p>For Bogdan Bratis, founder of Saspod, a podcast production company, the issue is not so much quantity but the quality of podcasts.</p>\n<p>“Yes, there are too many bad podcasts, but not enough good podcasts. AI and accessibility to podcast recording equipment have lowered the bar of entry, and as a consequence, there is a lot of low-quality content out there.”</p>\n<p>He says that listeners are becoming more discerning and now demand better production and more unique ideas, moving away from standard question-and-answer formats.</p>\n<p>While Patrick Hinds, co-host of the award-winning<i> </i><i>True Crime Obsessed</i> and<strong> </strong><i>Golden Girls Deep Dive</i> podcasts<strong>,</strong> believes that the podcast community is indeed crowded, he says there’s still room for everyone. </p>\n<p>“Only you have your perspective, your personality, your sense of humor, your wit,” he says. “So even in crowded categories like true crime or wellness, you can still stand out. If you get into podcasting for the love of content you’re creating, you will find the fulfillment you’re looking for.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Can you really make money with a podcast?</strong></h2>\n<p>The question of whether or not you can <a href=\"https://www.success.com/rory-vaden-influence-income-guide/\">make money</a> with a podcast is not as straightforward as it might seem. Podcasters and media experts alike say there are many variables when it comes to translating a podcast into revenue. </p>\n<p>“The biggest myth around earning revenue from your show is [that] you need a lot of downloads. False,” says Matt LeBris, host of <i>Decoding Success</i>, a top 1% globally ranked podcast, launched in 2018. </p>\n<p>“The problem is, podcasters who are just launching their show, especially if they don’t have fame or notoriety, try to imitate the likes of these major <i>Call Her Daddy</i> and Joe Rogan players,” explains LeBris, who has also worked with Daymond John of TV’s <i>Shark Tank</i>.  </p>\n<p>“Yes, they might have brand deals, sponsorship offers. And that is a legitimate form of revenue. The problem is, it’s not for everyone. We need to monetize through our own products, services or brand.”</p>\n<p>Olivia Howell, an award-winning podcast producer who is also co-founder and CEO of Fresh Starts Registry, a podcast incubator, elaborates on how to best position a podcast to eventually generate revenue.</p>\n<p>“When I coach new podcasters, we look at the podcast as a brand asset—something that helps you build credibility, tell your story and cultivate a dedicated audience. If you can do that with heart and consistency, revenue can show up in all sorts of ways: through aligned partnerships, paid speaking engagements, product or book sales, client conversions, or memberships,” Howell says.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen podcasts with relatively small audiences generate tremendous value because they’re talking to the right people in a deep, consistent way. The podcast isn’t the product—it’s the bridge to something bigger. That’s where the real potential lies.”</p>\n<p>Some media experts say that podcasts should not just be seen as a way to generate revenue.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.success.com/are-there-too-many-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is another to lose yourself. That is a greater loss.” ~Donna Goddard</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>We didn’t mean to fall into anything romantic. It started as friendship, collaboration, long voice notes about work, life, trauma, and healing. We helped each other solve problems. We gave each other pep talks before difficult meetings. He liked to say I had good instincts; I told him he had grit.</p>\n<p>We shared vulnerabilities like flashlights in the dark—he told me about getting into fights, going to jail, losing jobs because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. I shared about growing up in a home with yelling, hitting, and silence, and how I used to chase validation in relationships just to feel seen. Somewhere in there, something sparked.</p>\n<p>By early May, the friendship shifted. There was a night we were sitting together, talking about emotional sobriety, when I felt it: the weight of his gaze, the stillness between us. We kissed. And then we didn’t stop. I didn’t expect it, but I also didn’t resist it. It felt natural, like picking up a conversation we didn’t realize we’d already started.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>But like many things built on intensity, it became complicated fast.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>He opened up about wanting to explore something sexually that I couldn’t. It may have felt like shame to him, but that wasn’t my intention—I was simply clear: <i>I wouldn’t feel safe there.</i> He was hurt. Said I’d stepped on his vulnerability. And I didn’t respond perfectly. I froze. That’s what I do when I feel pressure or threat. I don’t yell or lash out—I go quiet, retreat inward, try to understand what’s happening before I respond.</p>\n<p>Still, I thought we’d moved past it. I gave him space while traveling, and when we reconnected, he told me he was in love with me. That he accepted my situation. That it was worth it. That he’d be patient.</p>\n<p>So I met him in the middle. I softened. I opened a little more.</p>\n<p>He was a <a href=\"https://tinybuddha.com/hub/mental-health/addiction/\">recovering alcoholic</a>—sober for nearly nineteen years. He had wrecked two long-term relationships in the past, he told me. He’d been arrested multiple times, fired for outbursts, and said he was trying to do better now. I believed him. I saw the way he loved his dog training clients, how he was trying to build something on his own terms.</p>\n<p>I shared my own journey—how I’d sought approval in the arms of others when I felt dismissed or invisible in my marriage. How I went to SLAA and learned to sit with my feelings instead of running from them. How I founded a company, Geri-Gadgets, inspired by caring for my mom during her dementia journey. He understood the grief of losing a parent slowly. His mom had dementia too. We bonded over what that does to you—how it softens certain edges while sharpening others.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>We had history, shared values, hard-earned wisdom. That’s why I was so unprepared for how it ended.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>It started with a question. I asked him what I should wear to dinner with his sister and brother-in-law after a meeting we were attending together. He responded by sending me a photo of a woman in a short leather outfit, over-the-knee stiletto boots, and a dominatrix pose.</p>\n<p>I stared at the image, confused. Was it a joke? A test? A dig? Given my past—the abuse, the trauma, the very clear boundaries I’d communicated—I didn’t find it funny. I felt dismissed. Mocked, even. I made a comment about the woman’s body, not because I cared, but because I was triggered. Because I didn’t know how to say, <i>This hurts me.</i></p>\n<p>That set off a chain reaction.</p>\n<p>We were supposed to be working on something together—a potential hire for his business—but the conversation turned tense. I felt myself shutting down. I needed time to process. I called to talk, to break through the tension with an actual voice, but he wouldn’t answer. He refused to talk to me—until he’d already decided to be done.</p>\n<p>By the time we finally spoke, it was over. He’d already shut the door. The ending didn’t come in one moment—it came in his silence, his refusal to engage when I needed him to. It came when vulnerability met a wall.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This kind of ending triggers old wounds. The kind that taught me to freeze when someone withdraws love. The kind that makes me overfunction to earn back safety.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>I was the child who was hit and then ignored. My father would scream and slam a strap against my legs, then bury his head in the newspaper and pretend I didn’t exist. Those are the things that shape a nervous system. Those are the stories we carry into adulthood, whether we want to or not.</p>\n<p>In past relationships, I chased. I made excuses. I convinced myself it was my fault. I’d think: <i>If only I were more accommodating… less sensitive… sexier, smarter, cooler… maybe they’d stay.</i> But not this time.</p>\n<p>This time, I sat with the ache. I let it wash over me. I didn’t rush to fix it or fill it. I didn’t reach out. I didn’t beg for clarity or closure. I cried. I journaled. I went to meetings. I talked to trusted friends. I worked. I kept my boundaries intact.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://tinybuddha.com/blog/when-someone-you-love-shuts-the-door/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Every year, you get 10 percent of what you spend back as REI credit. Spend $300 at REI in a year and that’s your $30 back in your pocket.

Unlike most of the AT’s spartan lean-tos, both of the two shelters are fully enclosed and feature on-site caretakers; hikers stopping at the 501 can order pizza directly to their door, while visitors to the Eckville shelter can avail themselves of its solar shower.

I spoke with Mary Beth about the future of two of the AT’s most unusual shelters, and where the community goes from here.</p>\n<h2>Transcript</h2>\n<p><b>Adam Roy:</b> Earlier this year, news broke that the National Park Service was planning on demolishing two well-known shelters on the Pennsylvania section of the Appalachian Trail, the Eckville shelter and the 501 shelter. Well, last week <a target=\"_self\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/appalachian-trail-shelter-demolition/\">we found out that a Pennsylvania hiking club, the Blue Mountain Eagle Climbing Club</a>, was forming a committee to look at ways they could save them. I’m here with Mary Beth Skylis, a <i>Backpacker</i> correspondent who’s covered the attempt to save these two shelters. Mary Beth, how are you doing today?</p>\n<p><b>Mary Beth Skylis:</b> I’m good. How are you?</p>\n<p><b>Adam:</b> I’m doing pretty well. So tell me a little bit about these two shelters in question, the Eckville shelter and the 501. What makes them so memorable?</p>\n<p><b>Mary Beth:</b> Yeah, they have a lot of qualities that make them really unique. The 501 shelter is known as the ‘Pizza shelter,’ because you can order pizza almost directly to the shelter. And the Eckville shelter, they’re both four-walled structures, which is a little bit unique on the Appalachian Trail—a lot of the time they’re just three walls, but they’re very protective. I believe the Eckville shelter also has solar toilets and things like that. They’re very luxurious shelters for Appalachian Trail goers.</p>\n<p><b>Adam:</b> So these two shelters, are they in disrepair? Why is the National Park Service trying to demolish them?</p>\n<p><b>Mary Beth:</b> My understanding is that they’re considered non-conforming, which doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the structures themselves, it’s more like a bureaucratic label. Back in the day when the Appalachian Trail was designated as a national park site, the Park Service started purchasing land on either side of the trail to kind of create a buffer. And sometimes when that happens, they also purchase structures that are associated with that land, and that’s what happened with the Eckville and the 501 shelters.</p>\n<p>Non-conforming, in this case, really refers to their proximity to the roads. They’re both basically right on a road, and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, their guidelines basically say that shelters should be two miles or further away from roads, so that’s one way in which they’re non-conforming. They’re also kind of unique in terms of their actual structures, where they’re really buildings, full-on buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><b>Adam:</b> Do you have any sense of why it might be important to the National Park Service that these are non-conforming? Is this literally just checking a box, or is there some kind of larger concern with them?</p>\n<p><b>Mary Beth:</b> Honestly, I think that it’s a matter of liability. I think that it’s probably very expensive and challenging to upkeep structures like that. These structures are, I’m not sure about in the 501 shelter’s case, but in Eckville’s case, it’s at least 100 years old. The building itself is really old, and they face issues like, porcupines have been known to chew through the wood. Just the basic upkeep of these structures can be kind of challenging. And then if you have people sleeping in these shelters all the time and there’s something that goes wrong, the Park Service could be held liable for that.</p>\n<p><b>Adam:</b> Tell me a little bit about the effort to save these structures. This local hiking club in Pennsylvania has stepped up over the past few weeks and says they’re going to attempt to look at solutions.</p>\n<p><b>Mary Beth:</b> I think that there is a lot of energy. Hikers in general are just really sad to hear that these shelters are potentially going to be demolished. Because they’re iconic. They’re cultural places, they create opportunities for people to gather together. The caretaker element makes them really unique in that you can chat with a local legend to learn about what’s going on in the area. And then they’re also located in a part of Pennsylvania where there are limited amenities, so without the use of these shelters, hikers would have to travel further distances to get to water and access points and things like that.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.backpacker.com/news-and-events/news/appalachian-trail-shelter-demolition-501-eckville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now, the brand is branching out with a new product designed specifically for use out on the water.</p>\n<p>The Paddle Chair ($115) is an inflatable, waterproof seat with integrated drain holes to keep you dry and comfortable. It’s made of ripstop polyester for durability, and it deflates and folds up for easy transport.</p>\n<p>“The Paddle Chair was created for those who love the water but don’t want to compromise on comfort,” Forrest Rogers, co-owner at Crazy Creek, said in a press release. “It’s a game-changer for paddlers, kayakers, and anyone who spends time on or near the water.”</p>\n<p>Bugout Bags, Cases, and Boxes</p>\n<p>(Photo/Pelican)</p>\n<p>September is National Preparedness Month, a reminder to plan ahead for extreme weather events and other emergencies. To help people stay ready, Pelican recently launched Pelican Prepare, a line of survival kits ($300-700) that come in sizes for one, two, or four people. The packages include everything you might need in an emergency for a 72-hour time period, such as food, water, shelter, medical supplies, and a radio.</p>\n<p>The two- and four-person kits are stored in Pelican’s crushproof, waterproof cases, so they’ll be able to stand up to whatever conditions nature may bring.

The smaller Micro Plastic Muncher is specifically designed not to fit your phone, but all the other essentials — money, keys, earplugs, etc. — will all fit. And the larger (~2L) Abijah works more like a daily carry. Both are made from 420D regenerated nylon on the exterior and 150D recycled ripstop on the inside.</p>\n<p>If you have a sense of fun and need a little carryall, check it out at Crumpler.</p>\n<p>Trail Clogs (in Suede)</p>\n<p>(Photo/Bedrock Sandals)</p>\n<p>Whether they’re your style or not, there’s no denying that Mountain Clogs ($160) have a distinct aesthetic. Bedrock Sandals is adding to its lineup of rugged, trail-ready clogs with new options in suede and vegan leather.</p>\n<p>The 100% vegan model is made with a synthetic microfiber on the outside and lined with a polyester space mesh. Over time, the material stretches to fit the shape of your foot. Also new this fall is the Obsidian color. If you’re looking for a Mountain Clog with a streamlined, chic vibe, this all-black design will do the trick.</p>\n<p>FOX is taking one of its most storied forks — the 38 — and releasing it in a limited-edition color scheme. Only 1,000 of the FOX 38 Racing Green forks ($1,309) will be available. The color pays tribute to the history of auto racing in the early 20th century, when British drivers painted their cars green.</p>\n<p>FOX says that the 38 “redefines what a long-travel single crown can do.” It’s designed for 170mm of travel, and the Grip X2 damping helps deliver controlled descents. The brand designed the lightweight Kabolt X Axle to lower friction for a smoother suspension.</p>\n<p>Cozy Puffy Blanket Liner</p>\n<p>(Photo/Rumpl)</p>\n<p>Rumpl is giving its signature insulated blankets an extra cozy feel. The new Fleece Puffy ($140) adds an ultra-soft fleece liner to one side of the blanket. On the other is the VersaWeave 30D ripstop shell, with RenewaLoft insulation in between. The brand calls it the “coziest and warmest puffy blanket” it has ever made.</p>\n<p>Not only is the fleece antimicrobial, but it’s also designed to resist piling and shedding. The Fleece Puffy is available in one- and two-person sizes, and comes in fun, nature-inspired prints like Teton Glow and Valley Dawn.</p>\n<p>Super-Light, PFAS-Free, All-Sport Shell</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/emerging-gear/emerging-gear-9-18-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

On September 11, Kiersch freed an open project at Vermont’s Lone Rock Point, dubbing it <i>Mad Lib </i>(5.14d/9a).</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>“There are existing 5.14s at the wall, and this line is an obvious link through the hardest sections of the cliff,” Kiersch told <i>Climbing</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Mad Lib </i>represents the hardest FA on the continent by a female climber since Beth Rodden’s 2008 <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/meltdown-beth-rodden/\">takedown of <i>Meltdown </i>(5.14c)</a> in Yosemite. While Kiersch’s FA bests Rodden’s in terms of the grade itself, <i>Meltdown </i>could be considered harder than <i>Mad Lib </i>because it’s a trad climb. Beyond North America, the hardest first ascent ever by a woman remains <i>Sweet Neuf </i>(5.15a/9a+) in Pierrot, France, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/anak-verhoeven-completes-first-female-5-15a-first-ascent/\">established by Belgian climber Anak Verhoeven</a> in 2017.</p>\n<p>As usual, Kiersch pulled off this historic achievement with casual aplomb. The first woman in the world to <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/michaela-kiersch-dreamtime-v15/\">climb both 5.15 <i>and </i>V15</a> also happens to be remarkably relatable. Impressively, this pro climber lives a double life as an occupational therapist. She loves solo travel (case in point: her trip to Switzerland, where she sent <i>Dreamtime, </i>V15). And between cutting-edge ascents, she shares <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCot9C3N0UX/?img_index=1\">no-filter selfies</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMF8ULoOtfv/?img_index=1\">carousels mocking</a> Internet trolls, and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJFM4AMzN7I/\">cinematic homages</a> to her favorite beverage. (No, not AG1 Greens shakes or athletic performance drinks. Just good ol’ Dale’s Pale Ales, one of her sponsors).</p>\n<p>We caught up with this Salt Lake City-based climber to find out how she pulled off her latest feat, what else she got into in New England, and where she’s headed next.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h2>Inside Michaela Kiersch’s 5.14d first ascent</h2>\n<p>“It’s incredible to feel like I can contribute back to the climbing community in this way and start to carve my own path with regard to hard first ascents,” Kiersch says.</p>\n<p>Her newest contribution, <i>Mad Lib</i>, marks Kiersch’s second first ascent. She bagged her <i>first </i>first ascent in Kentucky’s Red River Gorge with <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/122350057/goldilocks\"><i>Goldilocks</i></a><i>, </i>which she called 5.14b, but Alex Megos later <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl6eaY9Khbi/\">upgraded to 5.14c</a>. <i>Mad Lib </i>begins on a previously unsent, five-bolt start equipped by local legend Pete Clark. The route then merges with an existing route known as <i>King Tubby </i>(5.14a), at the top of which Kiersch says a “taxing kneebar rest” awaits. After the rest, powerful and dynamic moves lead up “an extremely beautiful arête,” coinciding with the top of <i>Terror Wolf </i>(5.13c).</p>\n<p>The fact that <i>Mad Lib</i> includes sections of several other routes inspired its name. “When talking with local Peter Kamitses, the suggested name for this route grew so long and nonsensical that it sounded like a Mad Lib word game,” Kiersch explains. “It was a bonus that this coincided with the hip hop theme on some of the other routes.” Nearby route names like<i> Bring Da Ruckus</i>, <i>Tiger Style</i>, and <i>Ghostface Drilla</i> pay homage to Wu-Tang Clan. In addition to hinting at the word salad of a conglomerate route, <i>Mad Lib</i> alludes to a producer who’s collaborated with rapper MF Doom.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h3>See where Kiersch’s route <em>Mad Lib</em> is located</h3>\n<p><br>\n<i>Mad Lib</i> rises 80 feet tall, but Kiersch says it “climbs much longer” due to its steepness. She spent six days working the route. On day five, she finally linked up the start. All in all, she estimates that she put down between 20 and 30 burns before redpointing it around 9 a.m. on September 11.</p>\n<p>The hardest section for Kiersch consisted of “a hard deadpoint to a pinch, followed by a barn door and karate kick.” Alternate beta included turning the pinch into a full crimp, then launching a deadpoint to a sloper. “The movement is stellar and unique!” Kiersch says of the crux moves.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<p><i>Mad Lib </i>is located on a limestone cliff known as <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110645111/lone-rock-point\">Lone Rock Point</a> hanging over Lake Champlain. “It’s pretty special to find limestone sport routes on the East Coast, and the setting is just surreal,” Kiersch says of why she decided to check out this crag. Her September trip was only her second time in Vermont; when she visited for the first time last February, she “fell completely in love with the climbing community and area.”</p>\n<h2>Plus, a 5.14c FFA for good measure</h2>\n<p>“Hardest bolted first ascent in North America by a woman” isn’t the only record Kiersch walked away with from her New England trip. Just two days after she sent <i>Mad Lib</i>, she nabbed the first female ascent of <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://27crags.com/crags/rumney/routes/livin-astroglide\"><i>Livin’ Astroglide</i></a> (5.14c) at Waimea wall in Rumney, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p><i>Livin’ Astroglide</i> follows a black arête, leading to a shared crux with <i>Jaws II </i>and <i>China Beach </i>up top. “With crimps, heel hooks, and pure resistance and recovery climbing, it suited me extremely well,” Kiersch says of the route.</p>\n<p>Rumney is actually what first sparked Kiersch’s desire to plan a New England climbing trip. “I’ve always been inspired by the <em>Dosage</em> [a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" data-afl-p=\"0\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://reelrocktour.com/products/dosage-volume-ii\">Reel Rock film series</a>] in Rumney,” she says. Then a good friend—and Vermont local—clued her into Lone Rock Point and the open projects there. “After seeing one photo, I was completely sold,” she says.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/news/michaela-kierschs-5-14d-mad-lib-first-ascent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Even the dirtiest dirtbags don’t want their feet to reek of the aged cheese Céüse climbers house between burns.</p>\n<p id=\"publisher_div\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, stinky shoes are an all too common problem among climbers. A couple culprits? An intentionally tight fit and durable design that’s incompatible with breathability. It also doesn’t help that most climbers opt out of socks while climbing.</p>\n<p>There are three stages when it comes to fighting foul odors in climbing shoes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Prevention:</b> Don’t let your shoes get smelly in the first place.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Removal: </b>Get rid of odors already embedded in your shoes—for good.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cover-up: </b>Mask the foulness when you’re in a pinch and don’t want to torment your belayer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to prevent stinky climbing shoes in the first place</h2>\n<h3>Start climbing with clean, dry feet</h3>\n<p>Don’t set yourself up for failure by putting dirty, sweaty, or already smelly feet into climbing shoes. Before you start climbing, clean and dry your feet. If you can’t wash your feet before a climbing session, bring <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://rei.pxf.io/c/2850304/1448521/17195?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F879973%2Fsea-to-summit-wilderness-wipes&amp;subId1=shoe-smells\">some wipes</a> along in your pack. For a more sustainable option, try bringing a couple <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Paper-Towels-Paperless-ZeroWastely/dp/B0BFB8T4XV/ref=sr_1_5_sspa?crid=3AOM2LTHSQS8F&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DM0VP76MaoRQdVc6O0BBQSQCG3wjzBzFxE36aKHWNWQwMyc7N58cwylqo5bZdIvCXxiNI2YIZl15t7hcIokWq5BsG9YTS4ArOo6Xgb2BEAhXVDnRBk4WpLF-TcYRIds03DEnREiJ0y1S-VXKGqKnGsgkIApcRk86V52hoFOTg1XrZ8UugjFr-LfRBeBOUi5K9NkWNdZ7Gdy48gTYEC7KAv6CO0tDX4NqLHdsAUHJfcJsJ9SoNuhKZYJvEeffE3kNdpZbsbtVNFYjOjAJD8B80080SaF5SmbmOs3Om32TuGY.ZCf3JY1hJbtWo7bdccplkNGjQJ2TqMsSLhn5dCVIs08&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=reusable%2Bwipes&amp;qid=1758053405&amp;sprefix=reusable%2Bwipes%2Caps%2C264&amp;sr=8-5-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;th=1&amp;tag=climbingdotcom-20\">reusable wipes or cloths</a> and dousing them with a bit of water and/or a couple drops of essential oils and give your feet a wipe down.</p>\n<p>If you’re particularly prone to foot sweat and odors, this can also be an effective strategy on longer multi-pitch routes or big walls. Clean off your feet—and air them out—between pitches! One or two wipes adds minimal weight and bulk in a pack.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I0-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h3>Let your shoes air out in between sessions</h3>\n<p>Storing your shoes in an enclosed pack or bag lets sweat, bacteria, and smells fester. The solution? Air your shoes out whenever you’re not climbing. As soon as you can, remove your shoes from your pack or bag and store them in a well-ventilated area. Hint: The trunk of your car or a small closet is not a well ventilated-area. If possible, hang them up to dry with a carabiner on a hook in a mud room, open gear closet, covered porch, or other airy spot.</p>\n<h3>Surrender your ego and wear socks</h3>\n<p>One of the reasons climbing shoes become so notoriously rank is that there’s no barrier between your sweaty foot and the shoe. While many climbers would rather give off heinous stenches than be caught wearing socks with climbing shoes, socks will help absorb sweat and prevent smells from developing. In fact, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/culture-climbing/climbers-in-china-are-wearing-these-unique-climbing-socks/\">this nine-year-old</a>, who recently became the youngest to send 5.14b (in socks), refuses to climb without socks. If you go this route, choose ultra-thin socks that won’t interfere with fit or performance for most climbers. Competitive, high-level, or dedicated slab climbers, however, might feel otherwise.</p>\n<h2>How to remove odors from your climbing shoes</h2>\n<h3>Powder your shoes</h3>\n<p>When you air out those shoes, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/gear/stinky-climbing-shoes-try-this-99-cent-solution/\">sprinkle some baking soda</a> over the soles, shake them up, and let that sodium bicarbonate sit overnight—or until your next session. Baking soda is absorbent and can help neutralize those send-induced smells.</p>\n<p>If baking soda isn’t cutting it, try <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Your-Toes-Foot-Bactericide-Powder/dp/B005ML8J8C?th=1&amp;tag=climbingdotcom-20\">On Your Toes foot powder</a>, which promises to banish the funk for up to six months. Though if you’re really struggling with shoe odors, you might powder your shoes once a month, every few sessions, or when you notice the smell returning.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I1-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h3>Put a banana in your shoes</h3>\n<p>Not an actual banana, but a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://backcountry.tnu8.net/c/2850304/358742/5311?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fso-ill-boot-bananas&amp;subId1=shoe-smells\">boot banana</a>. Co-designed by a climbing instructor, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener\" data-afl-p=\"0\" href=\"https://www.climbing.com/gear/review-boot-bananas-original-shoe-deodorisers/\">these moisture-absorbing shoe inserts</a> soak up sweat and wipe out odors with a mix of minerals, salts, and essential oils. Also, like actual bananas, they turn brown when they’re reaching the end of their lifespan (this means it’s time to grab a new pair). Stick them in your climbing shoes after each session to soak up any unsavory smells.</p>\n<h3>Try vinegar</h3>\n<p>If powders and inserts have not quelled the smell, it’s time to introduce some acid to kill any pesky bacteria. Mix equal parts water and distilled white vinegar. Then use this solution to spray your shoes. Let it sit for a few hours before rinsing and air-drying. For a more aggressive intervention, scrub the shoes with this vinegar solution and a cleaning brush or microfiber cloth—or soak the shoes in a water-vinegar solution. While some have also resorted to hydrogen peroxide to banish bacteria, hydrogen peroxide can be corrosive, so it’s less than ideal, as it could damage your shoe’s materials.</p>\n<h2>How to mask stinky climbing shoes</h2>\n<h3>Apply essential oils</h3>\n<p>Let’s say you accidentally left your shoes in your pack and are now about to go on a climbing date. Or you are heading to the crag in a couple hours and don’t have time for prevention or odor removal measures. If you need a quick cover-up for those stinky shoes, try spritzing some essential oils into the shoe. Lemon or lavender are always pleasant. Tea tree oil, while pungent, will likely be the most effective in obscuring stenches. You can mix essential oils with water and spray on your shoes, or buy a pre-diluted essential oil spray designed specifically for shoes,<a target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-afl-p=\"1\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LumiOutdoors-Shoe-Deodorizer-Spray-Odor-Eliminator/dp/B013TSRYUS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2Q5JXKGEBZ74T&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zXanIqM1WvCg6-3WbsX4YBfsbiVNIfoR5XP47A_8siVvSKmYTp5fJl0ahmx689zCvgiQ3j53qQRBHah-qeQLytRQrOT_1-nMWtiiyZJ_AjR5i9leTYPfXVjQrOBEYS53qHXXM9n6Ga1TNWI1_4zZoZHT8po_A06n4n1esxc0t2Mk-_cO95fHZx-lRDuuU2W5uhlV9LscxbqB-zllo8xarRZC-PuO0oxq9iDq1Jb1ePPPE6BfYdlf5aH8Gg30kQwLbxDMuwD6ZycD-WvChr-QLldvdmi-8pdrXCsaTtUCltQ.ZP14lkG1kY9wdnPXLc6PXUlJOpchlG99A0zDAnKlR4o&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=stinky+shoe+spray&amp;qid=1758057257&amp;sprefix=stinky+shoe+spray%2Caps%2C189&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=climbingdotcom-20\"> like this one</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"in-content-leaderboard-I2-P0-CMI0\" class=\"col-span-full my-3 flex justify-center text-left md:col-span-10 md:col-start-2\"></p>\n<h2>What <i>not </i>to do to make your shoes smell better</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.climbing.com/skills/how-to-fix-smelly-climbing-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Over the last several years, electronic shifting drivetrains have become the default choice on most performance-oriented <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a22577467/best-road-bikes/\"> road</a>, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a30730821/best-gravel-bikes/\">, or all-road bicycles. With the introduction of lower-priced electronic groupsets, the technology has made its way onto more moderately priced general-use and fitness bikes. As electronic shifting has gained acceptance, riders have discovered that a technology once considered only needed by Tour de France pros helps improve the riding experience of cyclists of all ages and abilities.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Since many new bikes now feature electronic shifting, there is a strong likelihood that the next bicycle you <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a62567352/purchasing-bicycle-at-a-shop/\"> purchase</a> will come equipped with this technology. But which electronic shifting groupset should you choose? Bicycle brands offer a dizzying array of dropbar bike models across several categories and sub-niches. And brands often add to the confusion by selling similarly equipped and priced models with Shimano Di2 or SRAM AXS drivetrains.</p>\n<p>So, it can be tough to tell the differences and feel secure that you are making the right choice—especially if you aren’t up on the latest tech news and trends.</p>\n<p>Three brands produce the majority of electronic shifting groups: Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo. Shimano and SRAM are popular on complete bikes (virtually every new bicycle uses one of these brands). Campy is worth considering if you are <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a63237594/dans-letter-of-recommendation/\"> building up a frameset</a>, buying a </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a61096406/bike-shop-video-episode-9/\">, or upgrading your existing bicycle.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Di2 and AXS functioned extremely well in our tens of thousands of miles of ride-testing on pavement and gravel. While you won’t go wrong with either, one might suit your needs or preferences slightly better than the other. Finally, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a60775015/sram-red-axs-2024-review/\"> SRAM Red</a>, </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a37407628/shimano-dura-ace-9200/\">, and</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a66050552/campagnolo-super-record-13-review/\">are so close in weight that the lightest group often comes down to the particular user’s parts selection. So, do not let the component brand or groupset be your determining factor. Instead, choose the best group based on fit and function.</a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Why Go Electronic?</h2>\n<p>Electronic shifting is a proven technology. While lower-priced electronic drivetrains are a recent development, the technology itself is not new. Shimano launched its first Dura-Ace Di2 group over 15 years ago, and Mavic had the Zap electronic group three decades back. Electronic drivetrains were once exclusively used on brands’ <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a36775360/road-bikes-not-race-bikes/\"> top-tier race bikes</a>. The technology then trickled down to mid-priced bike models, where cyclists across more disciplines experienced its benefits.</p>\n<p>Riders embrace electronic drivetrains for good reasons. Electronic systems shift more precisely, require less maintenance, and allow greater customization than mechanical shifting systems. Electronic drivetrains are remarkably low-fuss and work astonishingly well in even the worst weather conditions. Apart from charging batteries, and cleaning and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a40627435/the-right-chain-lube/\"> lubing the chain</a>, I rarely need to adjust or service the electronic shifters and derailleurs on my bikes.</p>\n<p>Another major reason to go electronic is—and this will be unfortunate news for some—because you do not have another option. In recent years, the two biggest component brands (SRAM and Shimano) have ceased development and production of premium-level cable-pull derailleurs and shifters. Electronic groups are now so ubiquitous that many high-end frames don’t provide routing options for traditional derailleur housing. If you want to buy a top-level bike with a 12 or 13-speed drivetrain, your options are almost exclusively electronic.</p>\n<h2>Electronic Groupset Options</h2>\n<h2>Shimano Di2</h2>\n<p>Now in its fourth generation, and named Di2 (Digital Integrated Intelligence), Shimano introduced cycling’s first commercially viable electronic shifting group in 2009. Many cyclists consider Shimano’s <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a37407628/shimano-dura-ace-9200/\"> Dura-Ace Di2</a> group as the benchmark in shifting speed and accuracy, braking performance, and overall weight. </p>\n<p>Shimano offers 2x12 Di2 at three levels for road bikes: Dura-Ace, Ultegra, and <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a40458134/shimano-105-di2-new/\"> 105</a> (listed in descending order by price). The brand also makes gravel-oriented Di2 groups named </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a60873935/shimano-grx-di2-12-speed/\">GRX</a>, which are sold in dedicated 1x12 or 2x12 configurations. All current Di2 groups are 12-speed systems with hydraulic disc brakes.</p>\n<p>The current iterations of Shimano’s Di2 2x drivetrains are semi-wireless. They feature a single battery inside the frame (usually hidden in the seatpost) and are wired to the front and rear derailleurs. The groups’ rear derailleurs communicate wirelessly with brake/shift levers on the handlebar.</p>\n<p>Launched in summer 2025, the new <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65158253/shimano-grx-1x-first-look/\">1x GRX Di2 gravel group</a> is Shimano’s first fully wireless dropbar drivetrain. It combines the wireless GRX Di2 shifters with a new wireless 1x-specific GRX Di2 rear derailleur. The battery for this system is located on the derailleur and is removable for easy charging. Shimano also released wireless mountain bike derailleurs that are compatible with the brand’s Di2 dropbar shifters; it’s a solution for riders who seek super-low gearing on their gravel bikes.</p>\n<h2>SRAM AXS</h2>\n<p>Of the big three drivetrain manufacturers, SRAM was the last to bring an electronic groupset to the peloton. However, the brand currently leads the pack in technology development, options, and compatibility.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s AXS (pronounced “access”) groups function extremely well and have been proven to perform at the highest levels of road and gravel racing. AXS is a trendsetting group that signals the future for dropbar components—fully wireless, hydraulic disc brakes, many options, and personalization. SRAM’s AXS shifters are also cross-compatible with many of the brand’s mountain bike derailleurs. This allows riders to run wide-range 1x gearing on road and gravel bikes (or install dropbar levers on mountain bikes).</p>\n<p>AXS is a fully wireless group and features rechargeable batteries at the derailleurs. SRAM offers AXS at four levels for 12-speed systems: <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a60775015/sram-red-axs-2024-review/\">Red</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a65060721/sram-force-rival-2025/\"> Force, Rival</a>, and </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a63424924/best-electronic-shifting-road-gravel-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The Bike</h2>\n<h2>What You Need to Know</h2>\n<p>The updated F-Series is the nicest Pinarello race bike that doesn’t say “Dogma.” The F-family has five models with three frame tiers (differentiated by composite grade), starting at $3,250 and topping at $11,000.</p>\n<p>The F-Series shares frame shapes with the Dogma F but not its carbons and resin, making frame and fork weight the main difference. Even so, the F7 isn’t a heavyweight—its frame is only about 100 grams heavier than the DF’s.</p>\n<p>On Bicycling’s scale, my review bike weighed 17.5 pounds, a good weight for an Ultegra Di2 bike with a white finish (white paint jobs always add the most weight).</p>\n<p>The F-Series shares geometry with the Dogma F but has two fewer sizes, still offering nine sizes—more than many competitors. Its geometry is nearly identical to the DF’s, providing a race fit wth quick steering and lively feel. The only difference is that the F-Series has <i>slightly</i> longer chainstays for more tire clearance. </p>\n<p>While the Dogma F is Pinarello’s top bike, the F-Series excels in tire clearance (32mm vs. 30mm) and has a better-sealed seatpost clamp to resist road spray.</p>\n<h2>The Competition</h2>\n<p>The F7’s competition is the gaggle of other Ultegra Di2 and SRAM Force AXS-equipped bikes on the market from brands big and small.</p>\n<p>Primarily, the competition would be: the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576257&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fperformance-road-bikes%2Fmadone%2Ff%2FF213%2Fmadone-slr-7-gen-8%2F46687%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dblack\">Trek Madone SLR 7</a> ($9,000), <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1576257&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Ftarmac-sl8-pro-shimano-ultegra-di2%2Fp%2F4221576%3Fcolor%3D5460177-4221576\">Specialized Tarmac SL8 Pro</a> ($8,500), <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en-us/bikes/road/race/supersix-evo/supersix-evo-hi-mod-2\">Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 2</a> ($10,000), <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-us/road-bikes/aero-bikes/aeroad/cf-slx/aeroad-cf-slx-8-di2/4036.html?dwvar_4036_pv_rahmenfarbe=R107_P05\">Canyon Aeroad CF SLX 8 Di2</a> ($6,199), and <a href=\"https://www.cervelo.com/en-US/bikes/s5\">Cervelo S5 Ultegra Di2</a>($9,950).</p>\n<p>My test bike ($8,200) ran Shimano Ultegra Di2, but the F7 can also be equipped with SRAM Force AXS for $7,500. Why the F7 is $700 cheaper with Force is a bit of a mystery to me. SRAM’s new Force group is superb, so personally, I’d take the discount and buy the Force bike.</p>\n<p>But even at $8,200 with Ultegra, the F7 is cheaper than most of the competion listed above (as usual, Canyon’s offering is, by far, the best deal, especially considering it has a power meter). And for $7,500 with Force AXS, the F7 is a Pinarello that is … a good deal?</p>\n<p>That’s a remarkable turn of events, as Pinarellos typically cost more than most of the competition due to the “do you know who I am?” tax.</p>\n<h2>Buying and Ownership Considerations</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>Pinarello’s frame warranty is, upon registration, just five years, while much of its competition is offering lifetime warranties.</li>\n      <li>Pinarello says this is a race bike, and that’s reflected in the gearing: 52/36 chainrings and an 11-30 cassette. Those aren’t Pro-Tour big, but they’re bigger than the average these days, even for a higher-end racing bike. If you need lower gears, the Ultegra rear derailleur is compatible with Shimano’s 11-34 cassette, and you can swap down to 50/34 rings too.</li>\n      <li>Pinarello’s published handlebar-width dimensions are taken from an outside-to-outside measurement at the drops. So, the “44cm ” wide cockpit on my review bike measures 37.5cm center to center where the brake hoods mount.</li>\n      <li>The seatpost binder can be noisy. My first ride on the F7 was a symphony of POPs and CRACKs every time I shifted in the saddle or increased my tempo. Once I slathered the binder’s pocket in the top tube, and the binder itself, in thick grease, the noise largely subsided.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>Test Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>For unknown reasons, my review bike arrived with the wrong wheel and tire spec—seen in the accompanying photos—installed, so I did not ride it in the form consumers will get. Wheels and tires have a big influence on how a bike rides, so I swapped wheels and tires to a control set to isolate the frame’s feel from the wheel and tire package’s performance. My ride impressions are based on the bike’s performance with the control wheels and tires.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>What Needs Improvement?</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>I’m finding it increasingly hard to forgive a brand for launching any bike in 2025 and not using the universal derailleur hanger (UDH) standard like Pinarello’s done here. Yeah, yeah: The UDH is a little heavy, and it is hard to build an elegant dropout around the UDH. But the convenience of being able to walk into almost any shop, anywhere, and pick up a hanger when needed can’t be beat.</li>\n      <li>Italian and not BSA BB? I feel like Pinarello is just trolling us. Much like UDH, BSA is the most user-friendly option. There are more choices, and they’re more likely to be in stock at almost any shop or online retailer.</li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>What’s Special About the Pinarello F7?</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/a67949971/pinarello-f7-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Experts in political science warn that such an outcome would not be peaceful ― and that Greene’s proposal is alarming. </p>\n<p>On Monday, Greene <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1967550436337996189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1967550436337996189%7Ctwgr%5Edc858c3d67e6e94404a1fcf081db4013d5c32aae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmarjorie-taylor-greene-national-divorce_n_68c86433e4b04bfe9a6f3814\">shared a lengthy post</a> on X, formerly Twitter, dangerously blaming people on the left for Kirk’s death, saying “millions” of liberal-leaning people were celebrating it. Many <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/republican-party\">Republicans</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlie-kirk-they-killed-him_n_68c87873e4b04bfe9a6f63bb?origin=home-zone-d-unit\">had rushed to publicly blame Democrats </a>for Kirk’s death, even while the search for a suspect was still underway — and despite the fact that both people on the left and the right have been subjected to political violence and threats in recent years. </p>\n<p>“There is nothing left to talk about with the left. They hate us. They assassinated our nice guy who actually talked to them peacefully, debating ideas,” Greene said of Kirk. “Then millions on the left celebrated and made clear they want all of us dead.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i/>\n      <i>Decisions in Washington don’t just stay in Washington — they shape lives everywhere. HuffPost is committed to reporting on how policies affect real people. Support journalism that connects the dots.</i>\n      <a href=\"\">Join our membership program today.</a>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>“To be honest, I want a peaceful national divorce. Our country is too far gone and too far divided, and it’s no longer safe for any of us,” she continued, before adding: “Tighten your circle around your family and protect them at all times. I will pray for the left, but personally I want nothing to do with them.”</p>\n<p>Greene has called for a national divorce before. Back in 2021, the congresswoman suggested that people moving from blue states to red states should have a “cooling off period” before they’re able to vote.</p>\n<p>“All possible in a National Divorce scenario. After Democrat voters and big donors ruin a state like California, you would think it wise to stop them from doing it to another great state like Florida,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1476226398540816390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1476226398540816390%7Ctwgr%5E7d4e0e121359c42fee32adeffd8fd8de83b8f362%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2FTKkBA9X%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1\">wrote on X</a> at the time. “Brainwashed people that move from CA and NY really need a cooling off period.”</p>\n<p>And in 2023, she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1627665203398688768\">wrote on X </a>that “we need a national divorce” and that “everyone I talk to says this.” </p>\n<p>She added, “From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the [<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/democratic-party\">Democrats</a>’] traitorous America Last policies, we are done.”</p>\n<p>When Greene called for a national divorce in 2021, political commentator and journalist Mehdi Hasan called her out at the time in a TV segment on his then-network <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/msnbc\">MSNBC</a>, calling her a <a href=\"https://x.com/allinwithchris/status/1476730274260168733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">“serious threat to democracy.” </a></p>\n<p>Hasan pointed out that Greene, who represents Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, comes from a state that “tried a national divorce in the 1860s.”</p>\n<p>“Why? Georgia<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/causes-of-the-civil-war/\"> wanted to keep the institution of slavery</a>,” he said at the time. Georgia was the fifth out of the 11 Southern states to secede from the Union, following the election of President Abraham Lincoln. The Civil War followed.</p>\n<p>While Greene’s tweet on Monday called for a “peaceful” national divorce, one expert in political science emphasized that such a scenario would not be possible.</p>\n<p>“Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s renewed call for a ‘peaceful national divorce’ underscores a growing belief that red and blue America can no longer coexist,” <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/ryan-griffiths\">Ryan Griffiths</a>, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told HuffPost.</p>\n<p>“History shows such a divorce would not be peaceful,” he continued.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>History has shown that attempts to divide the country have often resulted in violence.</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Griffiths, author of “The Disunited States: Threats of Secession in Red and Blue America and Why They Won’t Work,” told HuffPost that the “idea that irreconcilable differences justify secession ignores the violent history of such efforts, including the Civil War, and overlooks the reality that Americans are deeply intermixed — politically, geographically and ideologically.”</p>\n<p>He said that while polarization is “real and worsening,” the solution is not to separate. It’s to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“Americans share more values than they realize, and it is our political leadership and not the people that is most polarized,” he said. “We need leaders who reject extremism, denounce violence, and work together to heal the divide before the call for divorce becomes a dangerous reality.”</p>\n<p>Griffiths emphasized that the U.S. “lacks the conditions for a clean split.” Then he added, “Any attempt to divide, based on what we’ve seen historically, would trigger cycles of violence, displacement, and lawlessness.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://polisci.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/alvin-tillery.html\">Alvin B. Tillery Jr.</a>, a professor of political science and African American studies at Northwestern University, told HuffPost that he believes Greene’s proposal for a national divorce is “the Neo-secessionist language invoking the Civil War that has been common in <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/republican-party\">Republican Party</a> circles, particular in hinterland areas of the South like the district that [Greene] represents.” </p>\n<p>Tillery said that this rhetoric has been popular among “white nationalist politicians” throughout the 20th century. And that, then, when most white opponents of racial integration switched parties from Democrat to Republican in the 1980s, there was a lot of “resurgent talk of ‘states’ rights’ and ‘starving the beast’ of federal government,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“[Greene’s] national divorce language is just an extension of these themes,” Tillery added, before emphasizing the <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/url-charlie-kirk-people-fired-free-speech_l_68c86e62e4b00ea64839c70e\">dangers such rhetoric</a> has had on people across the country — especially those with public platforms.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-america-change-experts_n_68c9ab78e4b0765c82509d22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

An earlier painting of Niagara Falls had prompted a London paper to declare that “art wasn’t limited to Europe” and that “it was not necessary for genius to study in any school but that of nature.” His cloudscapes surpassed even <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">those of his Norwegian contemporary Knud Baade</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/173956226\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=680%2C316&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"316\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85814\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=320%2C149&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=600%2C279&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=240%2C111&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Niagara</i>by Frederic Edwin Church, 1857.

Details of exquisite aliveness punctuate the vista — a blue-blooming shrub, a pendulous bird’s nest, a resplendent quetzal perched on a branch, lichen on the bark of a broken tree, two people kneeling before a white wooden cross — all of it awash in light that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">only consciousness can see</a>, impossible for a camera lens to capture. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Rebelling against the stale convention of gilded frames, Church had invented a new kind of frame made of walnut wood, onto which he draped curtains to give the illusion of a window opening when the painting was being revealed. Silver reflectors focused gas lights onto the canvas to emulate the sunlit atmosphere of the landscape itself. The effect, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, was “simply magical” — “a new sensation in art, giving a reality of atmospheric space to the picture, and a delicacy to the tones of the coloring, which must be seen to be at all appreciated or understood.” Before the days of easy travel, before color photography, most of the visitors had never seen and would never see with their own eyes nature so wild, mountains so majestic. Here was virtual reality — an immersion in light, color, and feeling that speaks not just to the eye but to the entire system of being we call soul. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>For three weeks, people packed into Church’s studio, sometimes more than two thousand per day, gasping each time the curtain was drawn open, shuddering with the vertigo of the sublime. On the closing day, the line for admission curled around the block, around the clock. An influential art collector who would help found the Metropolitan Museum of Art a decade later ended up purchasing the painting for $10,000 — more than anyone had ever paid for a work by an American artist.</p>\n<p><i>The Heart of the Andes</i> was also an emblem of the cruelties of chance and the mercies of chance. Just after the exhibition opened, Church received devastating news of his hero — 89 and weakened by a stroke, Alexander von Humboldt had greeted death the way he had lived life: “How glorious these sunbeams are!” were his last words, “They seem to call Earth to the Heavens!” </p>\n<p>He could have been describing Church’s painting; he could have been describing that incandescent cosmos of connection two people enter when they fall in love — the cosmos Church what thrust into without warning when he encountered among the thousands of spectators the woman who would become the love of his life. Within a year, he had married Isabel at <a href=\"https://olana.org/mission-vision/\">the picturesque Hudson Valley mansion</a> he bought with his earnings from <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/16/frederic-edwin-church-the-heart-of-the-andes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Courtesy RE:PUBLIC</i>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>The American people own</strong> 640 million acres of public land, held by the federal government and administered primarily by just five agencies, the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service. This land comprises a whopping 28 percent of America’s 2.27 billion acres. US public lands generate trillions of dollars and are the flashpoint for some of the greatest political wrestling matches in the country’s history. And yet, no major media outlet has a dedicated public lands desk to report on these vital holdings. Until now.</p>\n<p>Last week, former Outside magazine editor in chief Chris Keyes announced the launch of <a href=\"https://www.republic.land/?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=REPUBLIC%20News%20Bureau&amp;utm_id=01K57F4NNKJPXA7PQQPWE6WWY2&amp;_kx=SG5AZlJuWT7h7132-59tDQ.T5M3aj\">RE:PUBLIC</a>, a nonprofit news organization created to cover the issues surrounding public lands. With the Trump administration gutting agencies such as the Park Service and Forest Service, and with congressional efforts to sell off millions of acres of land to private entities, this feels like an important move at a critical time.</p>\n<p>Keyes’s vision is ambitious. His planned budget for the first year is $500,000, with which he plans to hire an editorial director and a Washington, D.C.-based reporter, to launch a podcast and social channels, and to roll out a dozen investigative features. The build-out will also include a data team, regional reporters, and an annual printed publication.</p>\n<p>I caught up with Keyes to learn more. <i>— Stephen Casimiro</i></p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://media.adventure-journal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16153412/fe007e1d-0e94-472d-8342-a000f4d114d4.jpeg\"/>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Congratulations are in order.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Thank you. Yeah, I don’t know if it’s congratulations quite yet, but at least I got it out into the world.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Well, that’s kind of the big deal. Then you’re committed. I remember when I went to Outdoor Retailer the first day and told people I was going to do AJ in print. At the end of the day, I thought, “Oh, my god, what did I just do?” </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>That’s exactly what I was saying to my wife yesterday, because I keep saying, if this doesn’t work out, you know, I can do <i>this</i>, but now that I’ve started raising money, people are actually giving me dollars, I can’t believe it. I’m stuck now.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Yeah, you’re pretty well in it. So, tell me what RE:PUBLIC is.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>RE:PUBLIC is an independent, nonprofit newsroom dedicated to exclusively covering public lands issues. That’s our sole focus. We won’t be writing about anything else.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Why do you think it’s important and why now?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, we have 630 million acres of public lands that have been such a rich part of our history and are hopefully going to be part of our future. There are all kinds of management implications that need to be discussed and debated going forward. Right now is a critical time because the threats are unprecedented, but even in an administration where the conservation movement isn’t playing as much defense, there are plenty of other issues to debate when it comes to these lands. And then you combine that with the fact that we’ve seen massive contraction across media in the last two decades.</p>\n<p>One of the statistics I cite is there’s 75 percent fewer journalists working in America today than there were two decades ago. And so the media is overwhelmed, and especially right now, the issues going on with public lands are like the 18th most important topic for the national media to cover. They’re just overwhelmed by everything that’s out there. So, my theory is we just need more journalists covering this space in particular.</p>\n<p>It’s really important to me. It’s really important to the outdoor industry that I’ve been part of for 25 years. And while there are definitely pockets of great coverage of this, you know, <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=REPUBLIC%20News%20Bureau&amp;utm_id=01K57F4NNKJPXA7PQQPWE6WWY2&amp;_kx=SG5AZlJuWT7h7132-59tDQ.T5M3aj\">High Country News</a> does great work, there’s a Substack called <a href=\"https://www.publicdomain.media/?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=REPUBLIC%20News%20Bureau&amp;utm_id=01K57F4NNKJPXA7PQQPWE6WWY2&amp;_kx=SG5AZlJuWT7h7132-59tDQ.T5M3aj\">Public Domain</a>. They’re doing excellent work, but I would argue with anybody until I’m blue in the face that we don’t have enough journalists covering this important topic, and so that’s what we’re trying to stand up.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Do any of the major outlets have a public lands desk or even dedicated reporter?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Not that I’m aware of, and I did a lot of research when I was going into this. What’s encouraging is the major outlets all have a climate desk, and I think the US media is really well stocked now with those outlets and journalists covering climate change—as it should be. That is the biggest issue of our time, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>But there is no dedicated public land desk that I’m aware of. I think High Country News is considering standing one up themselves, but I’m not aware of any others, and that’s why I saw a great niche here.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How long have you been working on the idea? Where did it come from? </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Well, <a href=\"https://www.adventure-journal.com/2025/02/outside-owner-lays-off-large-percentage-of-magazine-staff/?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;utm_campaign=REPUBLIC%20News%20Bureau&amp;utm_id=01K57F4NNKJPXA7PQQPWE6WWY2&amp;_kx=SG5AZlJuWT7h7132-59tDQ.T5M3aj\">when I left Outside</a> [in February 2025], I took a month to decompress because there had been a lot of years of grinding. And the question I was really asking myself was, is there still a place for me in media and journalism? I feel like it’s been two decades with the universe telling me that this is not a comfortable or secure job choice.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.adventure-journal.com/2025/09/former-top-outside-editor-launches-public-lands-media-watchdog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/entrepreneur-profile/\">Entrepreneurs</a></h3>\n<p>Learn essential lessons, success strategies, and mindset shifts every aspiring entrepreneur needs to overcome challenges and build a thriving business.</p>\n<p>Back in July 2017, I attended a business seminar on entrepreneurship in India. With my appetite for learning and meeting new people, I wanted to explore the latest developments in the entrepreneurial world.</p>\n<p>What I took away from that event and from years of reflection since is that entrepreneurship is not just a career path. It is a calling, a test of resilience, and a journey reserved for the bravehearted.</p>\n<h2><strong>Entrepreneurship is for the Bravehearted</strong></h2>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is often romanticised as freedom, flexibility, and financial rewards. In reality, it is closer to walking on a bed of thorns. <a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/scale-your-business/this-is-how-successful-entrepreneurs-manage-their-time-differently/\">Entrepreneurs work tirelessly</a>, often around the clock, while navigating uncertainty and setbacks.</p>\n<p>From the outside, it might look glamorous, but behind the scenes, entrepreneurs wrestle with doubt, financial strain, and the pressure of making decisions without guaranteed outcomes. This is why entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart; it demands grit, persistence, and the ability to rise after failure.</p>\n<p>At its core, the purpose of business is threefold:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"1873\" data-end=\"1919\">To serve customers by solving real problems.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"1922\" data-end=\"1958\">To generate profit and employment.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"1961\" data-end=\"2006\">To make a meaningful difference in society.</p></li></ul>\n<p>In chasing these goals, entrepreneurs will inevitably face failures, even bankruptcy. But true entrepreneurs restart, rebuild, and reimagine because their passion for creating something greater than themselves drives them forward.</p>\n<h2><strong>Peter Drucker on Entrepreneurship</strong></h2>\n<blockquote><p>“Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.” ―Peter Drucker</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peter Drucker, often called the father of modern management, emphasised that entrepreneurship is both an art and a discipline. Success requires balancing short-term execution with long-term vision.</p>\n<p>Drucker described long-range planning as “risk-taking decision-making”, a continuous process of:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"2732\" data-end=\"2769\">Making decisions under uncertainty.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"2772\" data-end=\"2829\">Organising systematically to carry out those decisions.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"2832\" data-end=\"2873\">Measuring results against expectations.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"2876\" data-end=\"2923\">Adjusting course through structured feedback.</p></li></ul>\n<p>His philosophy is a reminder that entrepreneurship is not luck or chance; it is deliberate, systematic, and deeply tied to innovation.</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Become a Successful Entrepreneur</strong></h2>\n<p>So how does one move from idea to impact? While every entrepreneur’s path is unique, a few common threads define success:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/entrepreneur-profile/how-smart-entrepreneurs-leverage-user-feedback-for-market-success/\">Understand your audience</a>– Identify what people truly need and where gaps exist.</li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3429\" data-end=\"3519\">Craft a clear vision and culture – Vision guides direction, and culture sustains it.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3523\" data-end=\"3594\">Build a strong, committed team – Success is never a solo journey.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3598\" data-end=\"3668\">Create simple, sustainable systems – Systems outlast motivation.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3672\" data-end=\"3769\">Develop a magnetic and profitable strategy – Growth requires both innovation and viability.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3773\" data-end=\"3866\">Embrace collaboration – Sometimes partnering with competitors leads to shared strength.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"3870\" data-end=\"3961\">Innovate relentlessly – The moment you stop innovating is the moment you fall behind.</p></li></ul>\n<h2><strong>Success Sutras for Entrepreneurs</strong></h2>\n<p>Here are guiding principles, <i>success sutras, </i>for aspiring entrepreneurs:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"4376\" data-end=\"4440\">Follow your heart: Don’t let naysayers derail your vision.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4443\" data-end=\"4543\">Stay adaptable: Update your vision as markets, technologies, and customer expectations evolve.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4546\" data-end=\"4621\">Think solutions, not excuses: Innovation starts with problem-solving.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4624\" data-end=\"4717\">Avoid the trap of self-employment: Build systems and teams, not just jobs for yourself.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4720\" data-end=\"4816\">Break free from limiting beliefs: Family history of failure doesn’t determine your future.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4819\" data-end=\"4901\">Stay customer-centric: Focus on delivering value, not just pushing products.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"4904\" data-end=\"4999\">Accept fluctuations: Entrepreneurship is a cycle of highs and lows; neither lasts forever.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5002\" data-end=\"5091\">Prioritise commitment and competence: Together, they form the foundation of growth.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5094\" data-end=\"5176\">Acquire knowledge: A lack of “how” is often the real barrier to opportunity.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5179\" data-end=\"5266\">Build systems, not hype: Results matter more than temporary bursts of motivation.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5269\" data-end=\"5357\">Prepare for adversity: Problems don’t come one at a time; they come in battalions.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5360\" data-end=\"5442\">Protect your health: Stress is common, but it should never be your identity.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5445\" data-end=\"5525\">Lead with purpose: When your “why” is strong, the “how” follows naturally.</p></li><li>\n<a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/entrepreneur-profile/how-todays-successful-entrepreneurs-are-prioritizing-social-impact/\">Develop a pipeline of clients</a>: Consistent leads are the lifeline of business.</li><li>\n<p data-start=\"5614\" data-end=\"5697\">Play the long game: Rome wasn’t built in a day, your business won’t be either.</p></li></ul>\n<h2><strong>A Take-Home Message</strong></h2>\n<p>Ultimately, entrepreneurship is about more than money. Profits are the byproduct; customer satisfaction and impact are the true measures of success.</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs must learn to:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p data-start=\"6006\" data-end=\"6044\">Raise and allocate resources wisely.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"6047\" data-end=\"6088\">Keep reserves for inevitable downturns.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"6091\" data-end=\"6152\">Take responsibility for both bottlenecks and breakthroughs.</p></li><li>\n<p data-start=\"6155\" data-end=\"6239\">Put customers before profit, because when you serve well, profit follows naturally.</p></li></ul>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is not an easy path, but it is one of the most rewarding. For those willing to dream big, take risks, and serve others, it is not just a career. It is a legacy.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://addicted2success.com/category/change-your-mindest/\">Change Your Mindset</a></h3>\n<p>Discover why ideas, not resources, are the true driving force behind entrepreneurial success, innovation, and lasting growth.</p>\n<p>History shows us that the greatest minds, Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Walt Disney, Stephen King, and countless others, faced failure early on.

    "body": "<h3>By Maria Popova</h3>\n<p>On July 26, 2022, as I was living through a period of acute loneliness despite being a naturally solitary person, NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-lro-finds-lunar-pits-harbor-comfortable-temperatures/\">reported</a> that computer modeling of data from its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) had revealed several cylindrical pits on the Moon with just the right shape to be shaded just the right amount to offer shelter from the extremes of the lunar surface. Because the Moon has no atmosphere to act as its thermostat, its temperature fluctuates dramatically as it faces and turns away from the Sun, rising to 260°F (about 127°C) in the daytime and plummeting to -280°F (about -173°C) at night. But these unique nooks, which are most likely collapsed lava tubes, are a cozy 63°F (17°C) inside — he feeling-tone of a crisp autumn day in Brooklyn, where I live. Images from the LRO suggested that these pits might unfold into caves that would make perfect sites for lunar exploration — campsites with a stable temperature, more protected from cosmic rays, solar radiation, and micrometeorites. </p>\n<p>There is something poetic in knowing that we evolved in caves and might one day inhabit caves on another celestial body, having invented the means to get there with the imagination that bloomed over millions of years in the lonely bone cave of the mind.</p>\n<p>There is also something poetic in knowing that as we fantasize about leaving for the Moon, the Moon is leaving us.</p>\n<p>The prolific English astronomer Edmund Halley first began suspecting this disquieting fact in the early 18th century after analyzing ancient eclipse records. Nobody believed him — the Moon looked so steady, so unlosable. It took a quarter millennium for his theory to be vindicated: When <i>Apollo</i> astronauts placed mirrors on the lunar surface and when laser beams were beamed a them from Earth, it was revealed that the Moon is indeed drifting away from us, at the precise rate of 3.8 centimeters per year — more than half the rate at which a child grows.</p>\n<p>The Moon is leaving us because of the gravitational conversation between it and the Earth: the ocean tides. The drag they cause slows down the planet’s spin rate. Because gravity binds the Moon and the Earth, as the Earth loses angular momentum, the Moon overcompensates in response; as it speeds up, it begins slipping out of our gravitational grip, slowly moving away from us.</p>\n<p>We know this thanks to Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity — the revelation that space is not flat, time is not absolute, and spacetime is a single fabric along the curvature of which everything, including light, moves.</p>\n<p>I thought of Einstein, who at sixteen, lonely and introverted, began wondering about the nature of the universe by imagining himself chasing a beam of light through outer space; I thought of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, also lonely and also dedicated to the light, who at the same time was formulating his general theory of love as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/\">“two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other.”</a> And I thought about how love is simply the solitary light between people, neither partitioned nor merged but shared, to light up the sliver of spacetime we have each been allotted before returning our borrowed stardust to the universe.</p>\n<p>Somehow it all felt like a children’s book that didn’t yet exist. So I wrote it, having always believed that every good children’s book is a work of philosophy in disguise, a field guide to the mystery we are a part of and the mystery we are — in the language of children, which is the language of curiosity and unselfconscious sincerity, such books speak the most timeless truths to the truest parts of us by asking the simplest, deepest questions to help us understanding the world and understanding ourselves so that we may be more fully alive.</p>\n<p>By one of those wrinkles in time and chance that we call luck, shortly after I sent the manuscript to my friend Claudia at <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/enchanted-lion/\">Enchanted Lion Books</a>, I received a lovely note from a stranger named <a href=\"https://www.thesarahjacoby.com\">Sarah Jacoby</a> in response to my essay about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/28/margaret-wise-brown-michael-strange-poems/\">Margaret Wise Brown’s complicated love with Michael Strange</a>. Sarah told me that she too had fallen under the spell of their singular love while illustrating <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/12/12/the-important-thing-about-margaret-wise-brown/\">a picture-book biography</a> of Margaret. I ordered it and, enchanted by Sarah’s soulful watercolors and tender creatures, spontaneously invited her to illustrate my lunar story of loneliness and love on nothing more than an instinct of creative kinship. She must have felt it too because, felicitously, she said “yes.”</p>\n<p>And so <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coziest-Place-Moon-Maria-Popova/dp/1592704379/?tag=braipick-20\">The Coziest Place on the Moon</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1499654611\">) was born.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>This is how it begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>It was on a Tuesday in July that Re woke up feeling like the loneliest creature on Earth and decided to go live in the coziest place on the Moon.</p>\n      <p>At exactly 7:26 — a pretty number, a pretty hour — Re mounted a beam of light and sailed into space.</p>\n      <p>It took exactly 1.255 seconds, because light travels at the speed of dreams, to land exactly where Re wanted to land.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Across Sarah’s enchanted spacescapes, Re has a surprising encounter that takes the story to where it always wanted to go — a reckoning with how to bear our loneliness and what it really means to love.</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\tPublished September 12, 2025<br/>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\thttps://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/<br/>\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Picture this: You’re on a video call, nodding along while secretly checking emails, mentally calculating if you have enough pasta for dinner, and half-listening to your kids arguing about whose turn it is on the iPad. Sound familiar? You’re not alone and you’re not imagining that life feels more overwhelming than ever. These are classic <strong>cognitive overload symptoms</strong> that millions experience daily.</p>\n<p>Here’s why: Back in 2008, researchers found Americans were already processing 34GB of information daily. Today? We’re swimming in an estimated 75-100GB of data every single day. That’s like downloading your entire brain’s storage capacity, twice. Our digital interactions have exploded from 298 daily touches in 2010 to a mind-boggling 4,909 expected by 2025. We’re consuming 105,000 words daily, roughly 23 words per second during every waking hour.</p>\n<p>Your brain wasn’t designed for this. It’s like running fifty browser tabs on a computer built for dial-up internet. The result? Cognitive overload and it’s wreaking havoc on your focus, health, and happiness. In this article, I’ll walk you through the 15 warning <strong>signs of cognitive overload</strong> your brain is experiencing and share science-backed solutions to reclaim your <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/900019/mental-clarity\">mental clarity</a>.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<h2>What Is Cognitive Overload?</h2>\n<p>Ever felt like your brain is a browser with 47 tabs open, and they’re all playing videos? That’s cognitive overload in a nutshell. It happens when the information processing demands placed on your brain exceed its limited working memory capacity. Essentially, when you’re trying to juggle more mental balls than your brain can handle.</p>\n<p>Here’s the science: Our working memory, managed by the prefrontal cortex, can only hold about 7±2 pieces of information at once. When we exceed this limit, our brain doesn’t just slow down. It starts dropping balls. The stress this creates is what researchers call “extraneous cognitive load,” and it’s become the defining feature of our always-on culture. No wonder “brain rot” was Oxford’s Word of the Year for 2024. Understanding these <strong>symptoms of cognitive overload</strong> is the first step to recovery, especially when combined with effective time management strategies and mindfulness practices.</p>\n<p>Cognitive scientists break this down into three types: <strong>Intrinsic load</strong> (how hard the task itself is), <strong>Extraneous load</strong> (unnecessary complexity from poor design or <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/what-are-distractions\">distractions</a>), and <strong>Germane load</strong> (the good kind of effort that helps you learn). In our technostress-filled world, we’re drowning in extraneous load while starving for germane load. Every notification, every context switch, every “quick check” of social media adds another weight to an already overloaded system.</p>\n<h2>The 15 Warning Signs of Cognitive Overload</h2>\n<h3>Mental &amp; Cognitive Symptoms</h3>\n<p> Ever walked into a room and completely forgotten why? When cognitive overload strikes, your brain essentially throws up its hands and says, “I’m done.” These mental <strong>cognitive overload symptoms</strong> are often the first red flags we notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty concentrating</strong> becomes your new normal. Simple tasks feel like climbing Everest. Your mind wanders mid-sentence, and what should take minutes stretches into hours. Research confirms this isn’t just in your head. Studies show high cognitive load significantly delays decision-making <sup>[1]</sup>. Learning how to improve focus and concentration can help combat these symptoms.</p>\n<p><strong>Memory turns unreliable</strong>, like a phone with a dying battery. Deadlines vanish from your mental calendar. Appointments? What appointments? Your brain, overwhelmed with processing current information, simply can’t encode new memories properly. Both short-term and long-term memory take a hit.</p>\n<p>Then comes <strong>decision paralysis</strong>. Choosing between two lunch options feels monumental. You default to “good enough” choices because your <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/903991/mental-energy\">mental energy</a> is depleted. Analysis paralysis sets in. You can see all the options but can’t evaluate them properly.</p>\n<p><strong>Mental fog</strong> descends like thinking through thick soup. Following conversations becomes exhausting. Simple information that you’d normally process instantly now requires multiple reads. I once spent ten minutes rereading the same email paragraph, understanding less with each attempt.</p>\n<p>Finally, your <strong>problem-solving skills</strong> plummet. Challenges that you’d typically tackle creatively now seem insurmountable. You find yourself relying on familiar patterns, unable to think outside the box. Innovation? That requires mental bandwidth you simply don’t have.</p>\n<p>These <strong>cognitive overload warning signs</strong> compound each other, creating a vicious cycle where decreased cognitive function leads to more stress, which further impairs your mental capabilities. If left unchecked, this can lead to burnout and chronic stress.</p>\n<h3>Emotional &amp; Behavioral Symptoms</h3>\n<p> Have you ever felt like your emotions are on a hair trigger, ready to explode at the slightest provocation? When <strong>symptoms of cognitive overload</strong> set in, they don’t just affect how we think. They fundamentally change how we feel and behave.</p>\n<p><strong>The stress response goes into overdrive.</strong> Your body pumps out cortisol like it’s preparing for battle, even during routine activities. Heart racing while checking emails? Sweating through a simple phone call? That’s your overloaded system triggering a physiological alarm that won’t shut off.</p>\n<p>Irritability becomes your default setting. Remember Sarah, the marketing manager who used to be known for her patience? Now she snaps at colleagues who suggest alternative strategies. When information doesn’t align with her fixed beliefs, frustration boils over. A minor scheduling change sends her into an emotional tailspin that leaves everyone walking on eggshells.</p>\n<p>The sense of being overwhelmed creeps in like fog. Too many choices, too many demands, too much everything. You stare at your to-do list, paralyzed, unable to prioritize because your brain can’t shift gears between tasks. Simple decisions feel monumentally exhausting.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/991165/cognitive-overload-symptoms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>You’ve spent three hours researching the ‘perfect’ project management tool, created spreadsheets comparing 15 different options, and yet… you still haven’t made a decision. Sound familiar? Welcome to the frustrating world of <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/888848/analysis-paralysis\">analysis paralysis</a>, where your brain becomes your biggest roadblock.</p>\n<p>Here’s what’s maddening: you know exactly what needs to be done. The path forward is clear, the next steps are obvious, but something keeps you stuck in an endless loop of research, comparison, and second-guessing. This knowing-doing gap hits <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/884654/high-achievers\">high achievers</a> particularly hard because we’re wired to make informed decisions. We want to be thorough, responsible, strategic. But somewhere along the way, our strength becomes our weakness. According to an IDC study, knowledge workers now spend over 50% of their workweek just processing information rather than taking meaningful action. That’s half your professional life lost to the hamster wheel of analysis.</p>\n<p>Look, this isn’t another pep talk filled with “just do it” platitudes. You’re too smart for that, and frankly, if it were that simple, you’d have solved this already. What you’ll find here is different—strategies specifically designed for intelligent, capable professionals who overthink, backed by neuroscience and proven through real-world application. By the end of this article, you’ll have 7 actionable strategies to break free from analysis paralysis and a simple framework you can start using today.</p>\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#what-analysis-paralysis-really-is-and-why-smart-people-suffer-most\">What Analysis Paralysis Really Is (And Why Smart People Suffer Most)</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#the-root-causes-why-youre-stuck\">The Root Causes (Why You're Stuck)</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-1-the-10-10-10-rule\">Strategy #1: The 10-10-10 Rule</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-2-the-good-enough-decision-framework\">Strategy #2: The \"Good Enough\" Decision Framework</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-3-the-two-option-shortcut\">Strategy #3: The Two-Option Shortcut</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-4-time-boxing-your-decisions\">Strategy #4: Time Boxing Your Decisions</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-5-the-trusted-advisor-limit\">Strategy #5: The Trusted Advisor Limit</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-6-the-pre-decision-protocol\">Strategy #6: The Pre-Decision Protocol</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#strategy-7-the-action-momentum-method\">Strategy #7: The Action Momentum Method</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#your-personal-action-plan\">Your Personal Action Plan</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>What Analysis Paralysis Really Is (And Why Smart People Suffer Most)</h2>\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight: analysis paralysis isn’t just “overthinking.” It’s a full-blown cognitive overload pattern that traps your brain in an endless loop of what-ifs and maybes.</p>\n<p>Here’s the cruel irony—the smarter you are, the worse it gets. Why? Because intelligence gives you the superpower of seeing multiple angles, spotting potential pitfalls, and imagining countless scenarios. Your brain becomes a master at generating options. Ten ways to approach that project. Twenty potential outcomes. Fifty things that could go wrong. Before you know it, you’re drowning in possibilities, unable to move forward because every path seems equally valid—or equally risky.</p>\n<p>Research by Beilock and Carr revealed something fascinating about our working memory: it has hard limits <sup>[1]</sup>. When faced with complex decisions, your brain tries to juggle too many variables at once, like a computer running too many programs. The system crashes.</p>\n<p>But here’s where it gets worse. <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/973451/anxiety\">Anxiety</a> enters the chat. When you’re stressed about making the “perfect” decision, your amygdala hijacks your prefrontal cortex—the brain’s CEO. Suddenly, the part of your brain responsible for rational decision-making is offline, leaving you in fight-or-flight mode over choosing a project management tool.</p>\n<p>High achievers? You’re especially screwed. Your track record of success has trained you to expect perfection. Every decision feels like it could make or break your reputation.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk numbers. Each delayed decision costs you more than time—it costs opportunities. That business idea you’ve been “researching” for six months? Someone else just launched it. The promotion you’re “preparing” for? Your colleague who took imperfect action got it.</p>\n<p>But the energy drain might be worse. <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/905612/what-is-decision-fatigue\">Decision fatigue</a> isn’t just tired—it’s the mental equivalent of running a marathon while juggling flaming torches. Your brain burns glucose like crazy when stuck in analysis mode, leaving you exhausted without accomplishing anything.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/860786/understanding-imposter-syndrome-with-mike-kitko\">imposter syndrome</a> reinforcement cycle. Every time you delay, that inner critic whispers, “See? A real expert would know what to do immediately.” Your team starts noticing too. They begin routing decisions around you, eroding your leadership credibility one hesitation at a time.</p>\n<p>Time for brutal honesty. Answer these five questions:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Do you spend more time researching than implementing?</strong> (If your browser has 47 tabs open for one decision, that’s a yes.)</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Have you ever abandoned a decision entirely due to overwhelm?</strong> (That domain name you never bought because you couldn’t pick the “perfect” one?)</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Do you seek input from 5+ people before making decisions?</strong> (Polling everyone from your mom to your mailman doesn’t make the choice easier.)</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Does the  fear of making the “wrong” choice keep you up at night?</strong> (3 AM anxiety spirals about hypothetical failures count.)</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Do you have multiple unfinished projects due to  perfectionism?</strong> (That half-written book, abandoned course, or “almost ready” product launch?)</p>\n<p>If you answered yes to three or more, congratulations—you’re officially in the analysis paralysis club. The good news? Recognizing it is the first step to breaking free.</p>\n<h2>The Root Causes (Why You’re Stuck)</h2>\n<p>Let’s get real about why you’re stuck. It’s not because you’re lazy or incapable—it’s because your brain is working overtime trying to protect you from… well, everything.</p>\n<h3>Fear of Failure Disguised as Perfectionism</h3>\n<p>Here’s the truth: perfectionism is just fear wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a briefcase. When you say “I just want to make sure it’s perfect,” what you’re really saying is “I’m terrified of messing this up.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lifehack.org/991161/how-to-overcome-analysis-paralysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Save what you have to double what you make.</p>\n<p>Everyone talks about <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/tag/money/\">money</a> -- some because they don’t have enough, some wish to make more, and some are simply obsessed with it. It has always been this way, but nowadays, making money seems to be the main goal on everyone’s 'to do' list.</p>\n<p>We’ve never had so many options when it comes to products, technology and services, and salesmen constantly try to convince us that we need them all to live a happier and easier life. But do we?</p>\n<p>In the past, people didn’t have so much to choose from. Now, we want the blender with six functions that we don’t even use. We want the expensive clothes that we don’t even like, but they are “trendy” so we still buy them to impress others around us.</p>\n<p>In the pursuit of getting all the things we want, but don’t need, we lose precious time, relationships, and ultimately ourselves. Of course, money is a means to an end. We need it for comfort, education, medical procedures and so on, but we should always remember that there’s so much to this life.</p>\n<h2>Here are 150 money quotes that will change your perspective on making money:</h2>\n<h2>Money <a href=\"https://www.goalcast.com/powerful-motivational-quotes/\">motivation</a> quotes</h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, we need money -- maybe for some of the things we’ve never had, maybe for basic necessities. Whatever our goal may be, money will be part of our lives, like it or not. We should strive for a better today for ourselves and our families, just as long we don’t forget that we’re on this Earth to make each minute count, and money isn’t everything.</p>\n<p>If you need a few words to get you going even when you don’t feel like it, check out our list of money motivation quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>Rich people believe ‘I create my life’. Poor people believe ‘Life happens to me’.<br/>T. HARV EKER</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Don’t just make money, make a difference.<br/>GRANT CARDONE</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Money moves from those who do not manage it to those who do.<br/>DAVE RAMSEY</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.<br/>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (<a href=\"\">more Benjamin Franklin quotes</a>)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Money can’t buy happiness, but it will certainly get you a better class of memories.<br/>RONALD REAGAN (<a href=\"\">more Ronald Reagan quotes</a>)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Money won’t create success, the freedom to make it will.<br/>NELSON MANDELA</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Rich people focus on opportunities. Poor people focus on obstacles.<br/>T. HARV EKER</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Money has no grey areas. You either make it or you lose it.<br/>KEVIN O’LEARY</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It’s not about the money. It’s about the life I want to live.<br/>UNKNOWN</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Make your goal more than money. Make it about helping people and creating a better future.<br/>MAXIME LAGACÉ</blockquote>\n<blockquote>To fulfill a dream, to be allowed to sweat over lonely labor, to be given a chance to create, is the meat and potatoes of life. The money is the gravy.<br/>BETTE DAVIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The goal isn’t more money. The goal is living life on your terms.<br/>CHRIS BROGAN</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You have to be myopic and completely focused and unbalanced in every way. Once you’ve achieved success, you’re free to do whatever you like.<br/>KEVIN O’LEARY</blockquote>\n<blockquote>My formula for success is rise early, work late and strike oil.<br/>J. PAUL GETTY</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.<br/>OSCAR WILDE</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fortune sides with him who dares.<br/>VIRGIL</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.<br/>THOMAS EDISON</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I’m hard working, frugal, steadfast, willing to learn and to build a credible name.<br/>LI KA SHING</blockquote>\n<blockquote>What matters is that you achieve success and become free. Then you can do whatever you like.<br/>KEVIN O’LEARY</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Keep your eye on the goal, keep moving toward your target.<br/>T. HARV EKER</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Where the determination is, the way can be found.<br/>GEORGE S. CLASON</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I always knew I was going to be rich. I don’t think I ever doubted it for a minute.<br/>WARREN BUFFETT</blockquote>\n<h2>Saving money quotes</h2>\n<p>Saving money should not be an option, it should be a rule. Regardless of how big or small your income is, you should make an effort in putting al least 10% away into your savings account. The unpredictable is part of our lives and you can’t never know when or for what you’ll need a certain amount of money. It is always better to have some at hand rather than searching for people who would loan you the amount you need.</p>\n<p>Save money for a brighter future, save for the sake of saving, or save for a beautiful holiday with your dear ones. Stop spending money on things you don’t really need, you’ll thank us later. Check out best saving money quotes.</p>\n<blockquote>Stop buying things you don’t need, to impress people you don’t even like.<br/>SUZE ORMAN</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I make myself rich by making my wants few.<br/>HENRY DAVID THOREAU (<a href=\"\">more Henry David Thoreau quotes</a>)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>That man is richest whose pleasures are cheapest.<br/>HENRY DAVID THOREAU</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Money is numbers and numbers never end.

    "body": "<p>Christine Reddall shares the harrowing story of her daughter’s diagnosis with a merciless form of dementia</p>\n<p>Caroline Preston <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/mind/alzheimers-dementia-husband-symptoms-didnt-know-about/\">recently shared in a Telegraph article</a> the crushing impact that her husband, Mark’s, dementia had on her and her family’s lives and how she plans to raise awareness. </p>\n<p>Following Caroline’s moving story, Telegraph reader <strong>Christine Reddall</strong>, 72, who lives in Leicestershire, has shared the harrowing story of her own daughter, Anna, who was diagnosed with Behavioural Variant Frontotemporal Dementia (BvFTD), a merciless form of dementia, at just 37 years old. </p>\n<p>In light of World Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week, Christine speaks of Anna’s diagnosis, her devastating deterioration, the all-consuming effects on the family and the challenges she faced:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“Anna started showing behaviour changes when she was 36. At the time, she was working as a research cancer nurse. Anna was a very experienced, dedicated and compassionate nurse destined to go far.</p>\n      <p>She started behaving out of character — becoming disorganised, rude, loud and lacking compassion. At home, she was screaming, banging her head on the wall and constantly eating food high in carbohydrates. Unable to control her behaviour, she became unable to work.</p>\n      <p>Her husband was beside himself with worry, her two young sons were scared — and none of us knew what was going on.</p>\n      <p>Anna was very reluctant to go to the GP. Once there, she denied anything was wrong. She didn’t look ill, and at the doctors, she seemed able to control her behaviour. The GP diagnosed stress and depression and prescribed antidepressants and time off work. Anna would not accept this and tried to go back to work. She kept saying there was nothing wrong, yet her behaviour was getting worse.</p>\n      <p>Approximately six months after noticing these behaviour changes, Anna was admitted to a psychiatric unit. She was assessed and sent for a brain scan.</p>\n      <h3>Brains did not shrink in 36 year olds</h3>\n      <p>A brain scan revealed ‘global shrinkage’ of her brain. The doctors told us that it wasn’t that unusual and was probably caused by meningitis which she had suffered several years before. However, as a nurse, I knew that there was something very wrong. Brains did not shrink in 36 year olds.</p>\n      <p>That year, 2012, Anna bounced between psychiatry and neurology with neither speciality coming up with any revolutionary answers — all other tests came back normal.</p>\n      <p>There was a wonderful breakthrough half way through this year when a new doctor came up with a probable diagnosis of ‘PANDAS’ (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections), which is a disease that this doctor felt could happen in young adults. Treatment for this proved inconclusive and we were plunged back into despair.</p>\n      <p>In my work as a Macmillan nurse, I had come across a patient with Pick’s disease (the previous term used for FTD). Putting all the pieces together, I realised that this was what Anna had. I told this to her consultant who looked at me and said “she is far too young to have that.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>“In September of that year, we found out what her diagnosis was. A strange word to use, but I count myself ‘lucky’ that both Anna and I were part of the NHS and I knew my way around the system. The consultant of Anna’s team helped me get her transferred to the London Neurological hospital.</p>\n      <p>I stayed nearby and went to the hospital every day to sit with her as she underwent a barrage of tests. Everything came back normal. She had no memory loss and it seemed as though her intellect was intact.</p>\n      <p>Despite denying anything was wrong, Anna’s behaviour showed that there was something very wrong. She wandered around taking food off other patients, banging on walls, walking into the kitchen and demanding her meals. When in her room, she had the curtains closed and the covers pulled up over her face. I sat with her every day in the darkened room. She wouldn’t offer any conversation.</p>\n      <p>A few days into her stay, Anna underwent an MRI. I was allowed in the room with her as she was so restless.</p>\n      <p>As a nurse, I had been in the room where the MRI images were shown on the screen. As I sat with Anna, I could see into this room and I saw the flurry of activity that was happening in there. Doctors being called in. It was then that I knew there was something very wrong with my daughter.</p>\n      <p>Her husband was called in the next day and we were given the devastating news that Anna, aged 37, had BvFTD and her life expectancy was between two and five years.</p>\n      <h3>‘I didn’t cope, I existed’</h3>\n      <p>Approximately four weeks later, Anna was transferred to a nursing home. The effect on her whole family was massive, all consuming. I didn’t cope, I existed. Our family tore apart. From being a happy and united family, we were suddenly arguing over what was happening to Anna. There is no blame apportioned to either party — we were dealing with something so profound, so unbelievably off the scale of anything any of us had seen before. And we struggled. We were no longer able to communicate with Anna’s husband and this had a huge impact on our grandsons.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/2023/09/26/something-wrong-daughter-diagnosed-frontotemporal-dementia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
