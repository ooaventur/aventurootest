From a monthly high of 0.0000146, the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/business/memecoins-gambling-dna-trojan-horse-crypto-adoption/\" auto-attrs>memecoin</a> had crashed 12% to 0.0000130 by Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the hack was even worse for BONE, which declined more than 43% in the same period.</p>\n<h2>Shibarium Devs Under Fire</h2>\n<p>In an announcement on Friday, Dhairyain sought to reassure Shibarium users.</p>\n<p>The project’s team had successfully frozen the 4.6 million BONE, he said, preventing any further attacks on the network or its bridge. As a precautionary measure, the team temporarily moved stake manager funds into a hardware wallet and suspended staking and unstaking.</p>\n<p>Post-hack, the SHIB Army has been critical of the project’s leadership.</p>\n<p>Tagging Shytoshi and Dhairyain, one X user <a href=\"https://x.com/Kripto_Fatihi_/status/1966971009770094876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>pointed<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> out that L2Beat highlighted Shibarium security concerns months ago. “Despite so much time passing, why haven’t the network deficiencies been fixed?” they asked.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, initial silence from Shibarium’s lead developer, Shytoshi, was met with criticism from the community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Why has @ShytoshiKusama been so quiet lately?” one user <a href=\"https://x.com/Yasei__Okami/status/1967486204099658239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>lamented<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>.</p>\n<p>“How can someone claim to be a leader if they’re vocal only during good times but absent when accountability is needed?” They added.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Shytoshi Kusama Responds</h2>\n<p>Responding to community outrage in a <a href=\"https://x.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1967672793526620471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>post<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> on Monday, Shytoshi said that “to suggest that I am anywhere except beside [other Shibarium developers] figuring out next steps is utterly preposterous.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Yes, we are on it, in the war room, so to speak,” he stressed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although he insisted the recent bridge attack has his full attention, Shytoshi acknowledged that he have been busy with other projects.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2025, the lead Shibarium developer has taken a step back from the L2, turning his attention to other projects and hinting at upcoming AI initiatives.</p>\n<p>For instance, updates to his X bio reference an upcoming whitepaper tying AI, SHIB, $SHY, and DAO roles. In an episode of his podcast in April, he discussed AI’s role in building “the operating system of the future.”</p>\n<p>Confirming his change of priorities, Shytoshi’s post on Monday said: “my focus now lies outside Shib as I push for AI initiatives to better all our tokens.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"ccn-you-may-like\" data-ui-impression data-tracking='{\"item_type\": \"internal-linking\"}'>\n    <p class=\"section-title\">Recommended Secure Partners</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<p class=\"ccn-vote blocks t-space _vote\">\n\t<span class=\"_text\">\n\t\tWas this Article helpful?\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"yes\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-positive\"></i>\n\t\t<em>Yes</em>\n\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"no\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-negative\"></i>\n\t\t<em>No</em>\n\t</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"_clear\"></span>                    </div>\n                </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/shiba-inu-shibarium-lead-dev-focus-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Liquidity across Ethereum and Linea, combined with MetaMask’s wallet-native integration, supports stability in everyday use. </span></p>\n<p><span>Arbitrage and redemption mechanisms help correct price drift, while reserve yield adds an extra buffer. However, risks remain if liquidity is shallow, audits lapse, or regulatory shifts impact operations, making transparency and adoption key to maintaining trust.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Key Features of mUSD</span></h3>\n<p><b>Native to MetaMask</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Seamless integration for swaps, transfers, bridging, and spending.</span></li>\n<li><span>Lower fees and faster transactions inside the MetaMask ecosystem.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Utility Across DeFi</b></p>\n<p><b>Real-World Spending</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Expected integration with the MetaMask Card for payments at Mastercard merchants worldwide.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Transparency &amp; Compliance</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Reserves are managed by Bridge under strict regulation.</span></li>\n<li><span>Regular audits planned to prevent trust issues like those seen with Tether.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>How to Buy, Sell, Swap, and Bridge MetaMask USD (mUSD)</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask makes it simple to manage MetaMask USD (mUSD) without relying on centralized exchanges. All core actions, such as buying, selling, swapping, and bridging, are built directly into the wallet for a seamless experience.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Buy mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>You can purchase mUSD directly in the MetaMask wallet using credit card, debit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal. </span></li>\n<li><span>Once purchased, tokens are delivered straight to your wallet on </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-blockchain-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>Ethereum</span></a><span> or Linea, with more network support coming soon.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Sell mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>MetaMask also supports easy </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/crypto-on-ramps-off-ramps-fiat-conversion-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>off-ramps</span></a><span>. </span></li>\n<li><span>You can sell mUSD and convert it back into cash, sending funds directly to your bank account, PayPal, debit card, or credit card. This eliminates unnecessary steps and keeps fees competitive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Swap mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Swapping mUSD is fast and transparent. MetaMask’s aggregator compares rates across multiple</span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/liquidity/\" auto-attrs><span> liquidity</span></a><span> sources, ensuring you get the best price. </span></li>\n<li><span>Gas fees are included in your quotes, so you always know the exact cost before confirming. mUSD can be swapped for thousands of tokens across Ethereum and Linea.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Bridge mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Need to move mUSD across blockchains? MetaMask’s bridge feature makes it secure and efficient. The system automatically finds the most cost-effective route, and with </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/cross-transfer-protocol-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>cross-chain swapping</span></a><span>, you can bridge and swap in one transaction.</span></li>\n<li><span>For example, sending mUSD from Ethereum and receiving another token on Linea in a single step. This makes managing mUSD across chains seamless, saving both time and transaction fees.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Why MetaMask Launched mUSD?</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask is not just chasing trends. Stablecoins are now one of the most profitable segments in crypto:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Tether </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/business/tether-financial-muscle-q2-billions-excess-reserves/\" auto-attrs><span>earned over $4.9 billion in Q2 2025</span></a><span>, while supply grew by $13 billion.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/tether-usat-token-us-launch-bo-hines-ceo/\" auto-attrs><span>USA₮, new U.S.-regulated stablecoin</span></a><span> announced by Tether.</span></li>\n<li><span>Circle’s USDC is widely used in DeFi and institutional finance.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/circle-arc-vs-stripe-tempo-vs-robinhood-l2-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>Circle is building Arc, a layer-1 blockchain</span></a><span> purpose-built for stablecoin finance (payments, FX, global settlement, etc.).</span></li>\n<li><span>PayPal entered the game in 2023 with PYUSD, backed by Paxos.</span></li>\n<li><span>Tempo, a blockchain being developed by Stripe (in collaboration with Paradigm), focused on payments, stablecoin-friendly rails, and higher throughput. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>So competition is no longer just about liquidity or backing. It’s about chain features (like native gas in stablecoins), compliance, cross-chain mobility, UX (easy buy/sell/swap/bridge), and how well one can integrate into real payments or business rails. mUSD’s wallet-native advantage is good, but that may not be enough unless the ecosystem keeps growing (liquidity, trading pairs, institutional usage).</span></p>\n<p><span>By launching mUSD, MetaMask can:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Capture a share of the stablecoin market revenue.</span></li>\n<li><span>Create tighter integration between its wallet, DeFi services, and payments.</span></li>\n<li><span>Position Linea as a go-to ecosystem powered by its own stablecoin.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Stablecoin Competitors: Can mUSD Stand Out?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The stablecoin market is crowded, with entrenched leaders and new challengers. For MetaMask USD (mUSD) to succeed, it must carve out space alongside giants like USDT and USDC, while differentiating from entrants like Tether’s USAT, PayPal’s PYUSD and World Liberty Financial’s USD1.</span></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/metamask-usd-musd-wallet-native-stablecoin-transak-stripes-bridge-m0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In a reorg attack, the normal transaction history of a blockchain is rolled back by an attacker who controls enough mining power.</span></p>\n<p><span>Essentially, a miner (or mining pool) with the majority of the network’s computing power can secretly create a longer alternative chain and then publish it. Because most cryptocurrencies follow the rule that “the longest valid chain is the correct one,” all other nodes switch to this new chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>This forces the network to discard the original blocks and any transactions they contained. The result can be dramatic: confirmed payments suddenly vanish and must be reprocessed, which opens the door to double-spending and undermines trust.</span></p>\n<p><span>For </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/xmr-price-breaks-out-monero-largest-ever-chain-reorg/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> and other </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/\" auto-attrs><span>proof-of-work (PoW)</span></a><span> coins, this kind of attack is essentially the same as a 51% attack, where one entity controls more than half of the mining power. In such a scenario, the attacker can block or reverse transactions and undermine the normal security of the blockchain.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Is a Blockchain Reorg Attack?</b></h2>\n<p><span>A </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/monero-jumps-7-despite-51-attack-reorg-kraken/\" auto-attrs><span>blockchain reorganization</span></a><span> attack happens when the transaction chain is rewritten in a way that invalidates some recent blocks. In normal operation, Monero nodes follow the longest chain rule: they always treat the longest valid PoW chain as the official ledger.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-foundation-reshapes-protocol-division-internal-rift/\" auto-attrs><span>In a reorg attack</span></a><span>, however, a miner with exceptional hashpower withholds newly mined blocks instead of broadcasting them immediately. Later, the attacker releases this hidden chain. If their private chain is longer than the public one, all other nodes switch to it as the canonical history.</span></p>\n<p><span>The “lost” </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/whats-inside-the-bitcoin-block/\" auto-attrs><span>blocks</span></a><span> and transactions from the old chain are dropped as if they never happened. For example, in the recent Monero incident, the attacker’s chain overtook the public network, forcing nodes to discard 18 blocks and more than 117 transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>This kind of attack can enable double-spending: the attacker can spend coins on the original chain and then invalidate those transactions when the new chain takes over. In short, a reorg attack exploits PoW’s longest-chain rule to rewrite history, and it typically requires the attacker to have a very large share of the network’s mining power.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Happened in the Monero Reorg Incident of September 2025?</b></h2>\n<p><span>In mid-September 2025, </span><a href=\"https://x.com/vinibarbosabr/status/1967202524810584454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Monero suffered its biggest blockchain reorganization in history</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. On September 14, 2025, the network unexpectedly “rolled back” 18 blocks, erasing roughly 36 minutes of transaction history.</span></p>\n<p><span>Independent observers quickly confirmed the event. Researchers reported that the reorganization began at block height 3,499,659 around 5:12 AM UTC and ended at height 3,499,676 about 43 minutes later. In total, around 117–118 previously confirmed transactions were invalidated (as if they never occurred) when the network switched to the attacker’s longer chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>The reorg was linked to </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/qubic-crypto-price-analysis-first-halving-breakout/\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic</span></a><span>, a mining pool and “useful proof-of-work” project led by Sergey Ivancheglo. Qubic had quietly accumulated an exceptionally large share of Monero’s mining hash rate — over 50%. By withholding blocks and then releasing its private chain, Qubic overrode the public Monero blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite reversing many transactions, Monero’s price actually rose 5–7% on the day, possibly because investors saw that no coins were double-spent or stolen. Still, the event marked the deepest reorganization on record for Monero.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because Monero’s protocol always accepts the longest chain as valid, the network had no choice but to accept Qubic’s chain. All blocks mined by honest miners during those 18 blocks were orphaned, and their transactions were sent back to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/mempool/\" auto-attrs><span>mempool</span></a><span>. In practice, this meant that some users and businesses saw their Monero payments reversed.</span></p>\n<p><span>The incident also shattered the conventional wisdom that waiting for 10 confirmations is enough to finalize a Monero transaction. Analysts noted that ten confirmations no longer provided sufficient assurance after this event. Many exchanges and services temporarily raised their confirmation thresholds to avoid processing risky transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>By the time the dust settled, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/monero-51-attack-qubic-pool-dogecoin-mark-tehrani-warns/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> developer and user community was alarmed but not panicked. Researchers confirmed that this rollback was the largest in Monero’s 12-year history and quickly pointed out that it was nearly a repeat of a smaller attack from the previous month.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Has Monero Faced Reorg Attacks Before?</b></h2>\n<p><span>Yes, Monero had a close call just weeks earlier.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>In August 2025, the same </span><a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604908675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic pool targeted Monero with a smaller-scale reorg</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. Qubic announced that it had performed a 6-block chain reorganization on Monero, orphaning about 60 blocks of history. This move suggested Qubic briefly controlled a majority of the hashing power.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>Exchanges reacted immediately. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/fr/news/535253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Kraken publicly stated</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span> that it paused Monero deposits as a “security precaution” after detecting a single pool with over 50% hash power.

It was an expensive gadget, but one that set the stage for Apple’s rise to trillion-dollar dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Eighteen years later, Apple’s latest flagship, iPhone 17, arrives at a familiar-looking $799. On paper, the price hike is modest compared to the revolution under the hood: bigger displays, pro-grade cameras, AI chips, and more storage than entire PCs of the mid-2000s.</span></p>\n<p><span>The real drama emerges when the familiar U.S. dollar is swapped for a very different yardstick: cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what if <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/it/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhones were priced<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> not only in dollars, but also in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP at the time of each launch? Suddenly, the narrative takes an unexpected turn. In certain years, an iPhone would cost only a fraction of a cryptocurrency unit, while in fiat, it would demand an enormous amount.</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s because you’re really watching two things move: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-google-device-cameras-next-wave-mobile-ai/\" auto-attrs>Apple’s pricing strategy</a> and each coin’s cycle of booms, busts, and everything between.</span></p>\n<p><span>\n<div class=\"toplist-table-container js-toplist-container inner-toplist\" data-list-container data-tracking='{\"list_version_id\":null,\"list_id\":\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\",\"list_type\":\"external-linking\",\"list_length\":3,\"list_placement\":\"content\"}' data-ident=\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\" data-country=\"us\">\n            <p class=\"section-title\">Try Our Recommended Crypto Exchanges</p>\n<p class=\"t-label\">\n            Sponsored        </p>\n<p class=\"disc-icon\">Disclosure<i class=\"ccn-icon-disclosure\"></i></p>\n<p class=\"disc-tooltip\">\n        We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you.

Pricing something stable, like an <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2025/06/11/iphone-prices-through-the-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhone<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>, in coins rather than dollars makes that volatility tangible.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunity cost lessons</b><span>: Looking back, “spending” BTC or ETH on consumer goods in early years feels like burning treasure. The first iPhone you bought with crypto could today be worth millions, or even billions, in foregone gains.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inflation counterpoint</b><span>: While headlines often talk about <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-slammed-for-sending-inaccurate-ai-new-notifications/\" auto-attrs>iPhone</a> inflation, the real “inflation” often comes from the numéraire (the unit of account) you’re measuring it in.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>iPhones Priced in USD, BTC, ETH and XRP At Launch</span></h2>\n<p><span>For launches with multiple models, this article used the standard (non-Pro) version and the official U.S. street release date (e.g., iPhone 13 on Sept. 24, 2021). </span></p>\n<p><span>Crypto prices reflect approximate daily closing values for that date (or the nearest available trading day). “N/A” indicates the coin was not yet widely traded.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>* 2008–2013 Apple heavily marketed $199 on a two-year contract. Unlocked pricing was significantly higher.</span></i></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-4-year-cycle/\" auto-attrs>BTC had only just begun trading in 2010</a>; the $199 “price” at a few cents per BTC yields thousands of coins, an illustration of illiquid, nascent-market pricing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Apple’s advertised iPhone 12 base was $799, but the SIM-free price many buyers paid was $829; the $799 figure is the canonical launch headline.</span></p>\n<h3><span>What the Timeline Shows</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Early 2010s:</b><span> BTC was tiny; the iPhone’s “BTC cost” was enormous (thousands of BTC in 2010).</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2013–2016:</b><span> XRP appears (2013), ETH launches (2015). Their low early prices make the “coin cost” look huge compared with today.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2017 bull cycle:</b><span> BTC/ETH soared; the BTC/ETH needed for an iPhone collapsed into fractions.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2022 bear market to 2024–2025 recovery:</b><span> BTC and ETH rebounded strongly, pushing the coin amounts per iPhone even lower. XRP rose sharply into 2025 as well.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Bitcoin Pricing Highlights How Volatility Shapes Perceived Costs</span></h2>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-price-climbs-trend-question/\" auto-attrs>BTC pricing</a> exposes how volatility in crypto can dramatically reshape perceptions of cost, especially for something as familiar as an iPhone.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Bitcoin Cycles and Consumer Costs</span></h3>\n<p><span>Pricing iPhones in Bitcoin often reflects Bitcoin’s own cycles more than Apple’s pricing decisions. For example, the iPhone 6s “cost” almost 2.75 BTC in 2015, while the iPhone 13 was down to 0.019 BTC in 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span>Apple hasn’t drastically reduced its prices, what changes is Bitcoin’s value, which swings the perceived “cost” of a $799 phone by an order of magnitude, depending on the month and year.</span></p>\n<h3><span>ETH and XRP Trends</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/digital-asset-treasury-companies-bitcoin-ethereum-solana/\" auto-attrs>Ethereum and XRP</a> follow their own trajectories.
