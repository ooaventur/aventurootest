    "body": "<p>Watch Trump arrive in New York for his arraignment</p>\n<p>01:18</p>\n<p>What we covered here</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p>Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”</p>\n<p>In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.</p>\n<p>However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.</p>\n<p>The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.</p>\n<p>The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategy</p>\n<p>From CNN's Jeff Zeleny</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.</p>\n<p>But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump, gives an interview outside of Trump Tower on March 21 in New York City.</p>\n<p>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”</p>\n<p>On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.”</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>The former president met with attorneys at Trump Tower on the eve of his arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Kristen Holmes</p>\n<p>From left to right: Susan Necheles, Todd Blanche and Joe Tacopina.</p>\n<p>(Reuters/Getty Images)</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He places the statuette back into the box and then covers it with what appears to be paper wrapping.

Russell warned the real figure is “likely far higher” than the numbers verified by the UN agency.</p>\n<p>Finland’s official accession to NATO is historic, alliance chief says: NATOSecretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it will be historic when the military alliance raises the Finnish flag for the first time at its headquarters on Tuesday after it was announced that Finland was joining the alliance. “This is a historic week. Tomorrow we will welcome Finland as the 31st member of NATO, making Finland safer and our alliance stronger. We will raise the Finnish flag for the first time here at NATO Headquarters,” Stoltenberg said, speaking in Brussels Monday.</p>\n<p>Ukraine receives first tranche of $2.7 billion from new IMF program, finance minister says: Ukraine has received the first tranche of $2.7 billion from a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko tweeted Monday.

The report, which covers one year of war in Ukraine between February 24, 2022, and February 24, 2023, was a joint assessment conducted by the Ukrainian government, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/webview/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-04-03-23/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
