Speaking on Monday in front of parliament's public accounts committee, Davie said the BBC would \"work with\" Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), on the issue. \"Eurovision has never been about politics, it should be a celebration of music and culture that brings people together. We need to see what the broadcast union decides,\" he added. Fellow broadcasters from Ireland , the Netherlands , Slovenia, Iceland and now Spain have all threatened to boycott the event if Israel is allowed to take part over the country's actions in Gaza. \"We're very aware of the concerns,\" the BBC boss told the committee. \"It's obviously a well-debated topic and difficult. \"At this stage we are supportive of the European Broadcast Union's work. They are going around discussing with members, working through all the processes by which they would be satisfied to make a decision one way or the other.\" He added that it was \"really important... that we try to preserve\" the celebratory element of the contest. \"But at this stage, I'm supporting the European Broadcasting Union's work, and they need to get on with it.\" Earlier this year, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the 2025 competition in Basel, which Austrian singer JJ won after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. As a result, next summer's event will be held in the Austrian capital of Vienna. Getty Images Next summer's Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna, Austria Spain's Culture Minister Ernest Urtasun has now said Israel should not take part in the next Eurovision, repeating calls made by the country's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, earlier this year. In 2024, Spain joined Norway and Ireland in acknowledging a Palestinian state and last week, Sánchez accused Israel of genocide and announced a series of measures against it, including an arms embargo. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar responded by accusing Sanchez's administration of being antisemitic and of using \"wild and hateful rhetoric\". In August, the UN-backed food monitor, the IPC, confirmed that famine was taking place in parts of Gaza. Israel is accused of causing the famine through ongoing restrictions on food and medical aid entering the territory. Israel controls all border crossings into the Gaza Strip, and as the occupying power bears responsibility for protecting civilian life under international law, which includes the prevention of starvation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Political messages Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. The EBU said at the time that Russia's inclusion could bring the competition into disrepute \"in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine\". Before making this decision, the EBU said it had taken time to consult widely among its membership. Ukraine went on to win the contest. Eurovision is loved for its camp pop hits, soaring ballads and everything inbetween. But over the years, artists have used their platform to send subtle - and not so subtle - political messages. In 2023, Switzerland sent an anti-war song, Watergun, while Iceland were fined €5,000 back in 2019 for flying a Palestinian flag during the competition. In 2016, Ukraine also won the event with a song called 1944 about the ethnic cleansing of Crimean Tatars in that year by Soviet forces.

In his acceptance speech, the 52-year-old, who grew up in the Merseyside town, said: \"This kind of thing doesn't happen to a kid like me.\" Adolescence saw Graham play Eddie Miller, the father of a teenage boy accused of killing a female schoolmate. The star, who was named outstanding lead actor, also paid tribute to his children and wife Hannah Walters who he described as his \"rock\" and \"soulmate\". The series scooped six trophies at the awards, including one for outstanding supporting actor which was won by Owen Cooper who, at just 15, became the youngest-ever male Emmy winner for his breakout performance in Adolescence. Netflix Stephen Graham played Eddie Miller, the father of a 13-year-old boy accused of murder Graham is mixed race, with Jamaican heritage on his father's side. Speaking on BBC's Desert Island Discs in 2019 he talked about how, growing up, he had felt \"slightly unsure where I fitted in\" and how his stepfather, who is also mixed race, taught him about his cultural heritage. He said his stepfather - who he affectionately calls \"Pops\" - had supported his desire to become an actor and would regularly take him to Quarry Green video shop in Kirkby which Graham said was the start of his love affair with films. After cutting his teeth at the Everyman Youth Theatre in Liverpool, Graham found widespread fame with his performance in Shane Meadows' 2006 film This Is England before going on to star on the big and small screen on both sides of the Atlantic. He has also previously spoken openly about attempting suicide and how his family, friends and love helped him to \"slowly come round to the understanding that it was okay; life was worth living\". BBC Sounds: Desert Island Discs - Stephen Graham In his acceptance speech at the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday he said: \"This kind of thing doesn't happen to a kid like me. I'm just a mixed race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby. \"So for me, to be here today, in front of my peers and to be acknowledged by you is the utmost humbling thing I could ever imagine in my life and it shows you that any dream is possible. \"There's too many people to thank but I am going to thank my friends and family.

Speaking to the Guardian while on a trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, he said: \"I don't believe that I aired my dirty laundry in public. It was a difficult message, but I did it in the best way possible. My conscience is clear.\" His comments came just days after a short meeting with his father , King Charles, their first meeting in over a year. It was the first time the pair had met since February 2024. The prince, who also appeared with his wife in the 2022 Netflix series Harry and Meghan, also spoke about his upcoming legal case against the Daily Mail's publisher, Associated Newspapers, at the High Court in London. He is suing them over allegations of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering along with Sir Elton John, Baroness Lawrence and other public figures. Associated Newspapers has denied claims that it hacked phones, calling them \"preposterous smears\". \"It is not about revenge, it is about accountability,\" said the Prince, who now lives in the US but returned to the UK last week to attend a series of events related to causes he supports. Underlining his \"love\" for the UK, he suggested he would like to return home to see his family more often. He added that for the coming year, \"the focus really has to be on my dad.\" Reuters Prince Harry laid a wreath in Maidan Square in the centre of Kyiv The aim of Prince Harry's visit to the Ukrainian capital was to promote the work of his Invictus Games Foundation and to celebrate the recovery and rehabilitation of thousands of veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries since the war with Russia began three years ago. \"Nobody should feel embarrassed or ashamed about their disabilities,\" he said. \"It's about flipping from sympathy to admiration and respect.\" After having laid a wreath in memory of the dead, he described the conflict as \"all so unnecessary.\" His work for Invictus, he said, had helped to give him a renewed \"purpose\" after his military career ended, adding that it \"saved me\". He spoke to the British newspaper about the cost of war and how he boxes to relieve stress - punching a punch bag - as well as his portrayal in the media. He stressed that while he felt he had been \"destroyed by certain members of the British press\", he also still felt a lot of love from the British public. In January, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and apologised to him settle a long-running legal battle over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.

RAF Typhoon jets will fly air defence missions over Poland as part of the military alliance's mission to bolster the eastern flank. Other allies including Denmark, Germany and France are already taking part - a jet from the latter was scrambled earlier on Monday in response to another potential incursion by Russian drones. Nato said that alert was quickly over. Tensions have risen across Europe since Poland accused Russia of the incident, which saw 19 drones enter its territory. Moscow has insisted the incident was not deliberate. The Typhoons will still operate out of RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and are expected to start flying missions in the coming days, supported by RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft. They will join Danish F-16s, French Rafales and German Eurofighters. Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"The message to Moscow is clear. Putin tested Nato, Nato responded with unity, and the UK will play our full part. When we are threatened, we respond together.\" He also described Russia's actions as \"reckless, dangerous, and unprecedented\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Typhoons joining the mission - named Eastern Sentry - was \"vital in deterring aggression, securing NATO airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies\". Drones and missiles have occasionally veered into countries bordering Ukraine, including Poland, during Russia's full-scale invasion - but this was the most serious incident of its kind and the first time a Nato member has directly engaged Russian drones since the war began in February 2022. Healey said Russia was testing Nato's air defences, while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \"the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two\". In a separate incident on Sunday, Romania - also a Nato member - said a Russian drone had breached its airspace. Romanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said. The drone later disappeared from the radar and did not pose imminent danger, the ministry added. Initial indications suggest the drones fired into Polish airspace last week were Gerbera 'decoy' drones rather than armed ones. There were no casualties. The incident led Poland to invoke Nato's Article 4, which allows member countries to bring any issues of concern - especially related to security - to the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main political decision-making body. Soon after those talks on 10 September, Nato confirmed it would boost defences on its eastern flank. On other occasions over the past 18 months, the RAF has deployed Typhoons to both Poland and Romania to protect Nato airspace, according to the Ministry of Defence.

Between 110,000 and 150,000 people turned out for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson's Unite the Kingdom rally on Saturday, with around 5,000 involved in an anti-racism counter-demonstration. The Met initially said 25 people had been arrested for a range of offences in what it described as \"wholly unacceptable\" violence, but revised that number to 24 on Sunday. Eight people are facing charges including assault and public order offences. The force has also issued photos of 11 people who officers are trying to trace in relation to the disorder. It said it had deployed 1,000 officers to police the operation and drafted in an extra 500 from other forces including Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, and Devon and Cornwall. In addition to the charges, the Met said one person received a caution and 11 people were bailed under investigation to return at a later date.

But a lot of the most famous examples - including that 90s girlband masterpiece - weren't actually shot continuously in real life. They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been. One of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards, was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption. It's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March. Audiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama. Its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world. The Emmy winners and nominations in full Adolescence star Owen Cooper makes Emmys history Emmys red carpet: Sydney Sweeney, Jenna Ortega and Selena Gomez Netflix The third episode, which saw Jamie speak to a child psychologist, was praised as the standout of the series The drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed. Cooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode. They find him in his bedroom and place him under arrest. \"You're making a big mistake,\" insists the boy's dad, played by Stephen Graham, who also co-created the series with writer Jack Thorne. But as the episode unfolds, it's clear there is no mistake. Damning CCTV evidence ultimately proves Jamie's guilt, and Adolescence begins to examine its key questions: what led to this murder, and what motive could a teenager possibly have had. It was a storyline based on real events. \"I read an article about a young boy who'd stabbed a young girl to death, and it made me feel cold,\" Graham told Radio X's Chris Moyles . A similar but separate teen stabbing hit the headlines just a couple of months later. \"And these two incidents were at the opposite ends of the country,\" Graham noted. \"And I just thought, why is this happening? And not just because I'm a father, but I think any human being with a moral compass can look at that situation and think, what's going on with society today that we're in this era where these young boys are stabbing young girls to death?\" Netflix Stephen Graham (right) co-created the series with Jack Thorne, and also stars as Jamie's dad Graham knew the success of the show would hinge on the young actor chosen to play Jamie, and casting director Shaheen Baig struck gold with Cooper - who had first become interested in acting around the age of 10. In a joint interview with Baig, Cooper explained: \"I don't know where it came from, but I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer. \"I still play football now, and then asking them if I wanted to start drama lessons, it was a bit out of the blue, really.\" Baig recalled: \"It was really [about] trying to find somebody with the emotional register to be able to play Jamie. \"Owen sent us an improv tape, and I remember first watching that, and thinking, \"OK. He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart.\" It felt very natural.\" Getty Images Casting director Shaheen Baig said Cooper had seemed \"very natural\" in his audition tape Many of the headlines surrounding Cooper claimed he had never acted before. But that wasn't actually true. \"It has frustrated us a bit,\" said drama teacher Esther Morgan, who helped run the weekly acting classes Cooper had attended for two years in Didsbury, Manchester. The Adolescence team, she told BBC News in April, had approached the Drama MOB school while casting the series, asking to see tapes of their \"strongest northern boys\". \"They kept coming back for Owen,\" she recalled. \"He just had something.\" It was true that Cooper didn't have any TV or film credits to his name, but not that he had never tried his hand at acting. In fact, Morgan suggested Cooper's comfort with one-take shooting was partly due to the drama school's focus on improvisation. When the show launched, Morgan said: \"It felt amazing, but I didn't realise it would be as good as it was, I didn't expect it to be talked about so much.\" For several weeks, the series dominated the news agenda, and eventually went on to become Netflix's second most watched English-language series ever (after the first season of Wednesday). \"We wanted to pose a question that got people talking on their sofas, in pubs, in schools, maybe even in parliament,\" Thorne said. The government subsequently supported Netflix's proposal to make the drama available to schools. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was a need to tackle the \"emerging and growing problem\" the show raised. Many critics shared the sentiment in their reviews. \"If you're a parent to a school-age boy... it will chill your blood\" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh . It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\" Clearly, Emmy voters didn't forget about it either. The show's impact was so undeniable that it was seen as the dead-cert for best limited series. Even Colin Farrell's painful months spent in a hot and heavy bodysuit and under acres of prosthetics for Batman spin-off The Penguin were no match for it. Adolescence's victory this year continues Netflix's winning streak, after another of their other watercooler hits, Baby Reindeer, took home several prizes in 2024. Netflix Actors Ashley Walters and Faye Marsay with cameraman Matthew Lewis filming episode two Adolescence might have highlighted the dangers of social media - but its success also owes something to it. Several scenes from the series went viral, from the initial arrest at the beginning to the camera that follows a pupil fleeing the classroom out of a window in episode two. Both moments were enhanced by the one-take shooting style. \"The choreography of camera and bodies, should you care to contemplate it, is remarkable, navigating crowds and corridors and public places with impossible grace,\" noted the LA Times. \"Long, uninterrupted scenes also allow a superb cast to dive into character and the moment.\" But the show's third episode, a chamber piece where Jamie spends an hour with a child psychologist, was perhaps the highlight. Hardly any other characters appear as Briony (played by Erin Doherty) gently probes Jamie. Cooper runs the full acting gauntlet - veering from vulnerable to furious, cocky to distraught. Bearing in mind that Cooper only appears on screen in two of Adolescence's four episodes, it was probably this performance which sealed his Emmy. Getty Images Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty were also recognised with individual acting prizes at the Emmys But the acting performances were praised across the board - with Doherty and Graham both winning for their respective roles, while the show also won awards for its writing and direction. After filming Adolescence, Cooper said he had decided \"that I'd do this happily for the rest of my life. I think Adolescence was the perfect start for me\". \"I think I did get very lucky to be a part of it,\" he continued. \"I just wanted to grab the opportunity with both hands. I went in there just wanting to learn. Wanting to do the job, really. And I'll take that into every other job that I'll ever, ever do.\" Much like Mr Bates vs. The Post Office a year earlier, Adolescence was not only successful, but had a real-world impact. It was one of those rare success stories that TV executives dream of. You can expect Adolescence to continue its awards momentum into next year, at the Golden Globe, SAG, and Bafta TV Awards. Cooper had better get his Emmys tuxedo back to the dry-cleaners.

This year's big winners of the night were HBO's medical drama The Pitt, Apple TV+'s Hollywood satire The Studio and Netflix's chilling psychological miniseries Adolescence. Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series. The Late Show host Stephen Colbert pulled off a big win after his fellow nominees in the talk show category rallied behind him following his show's abrupt cancellation. And awards night host Nate Bargatze implored winners to keep their long-winded speeches snappy with a running gag that saw his charity donation docked if speech-givers went over their allotted time. Here's a look at this year's big moments from the ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Adolescence sweeps its category Getty Images Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne's drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder dominated the miniseries category with wins for best series and for stars Owen Cooper and supporting actress Erin Doherty. Cooper, 15, made Emmys history as the youngest supporting actor to win his category, and delivered a heart-warming acceptance speech after giving presenter Sydney Sweeney a shy hug. \"It means so much to me, my family, people back home. So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,\" Cooper said backstage after his win. Backstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would \"spark a bit of a conversation in the UK\" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success. The Studio wins big Getty Images The Studio actors Dewayne Perkins, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders, Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Bryan Cranston The Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season. Rogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's \"getting embarrassing\". Alas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech. Emmy Awards 2025: The winners and nominations in full Sydney Sweeney and Lisa from Blackpink walk Emmys red carpet Adolescence star Owen Cooper makes Emmys history The Pitt bests Severance Getty Images Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards It came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee. The Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win \"a dream\". \"I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,\" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama. Before that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show. Host Nate Bargatze keeps speeches in check with a cheque Getty Images Emmys host Nate Bargatze kept a running tally of donations to the Boys and Girls Club of North America throughout the show First-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over. \"It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,\" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea. The \"game\" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag. The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called \"a very expensive wave\" that lost the club several thousands of dollars. During a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's \"actually making money\". But with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add on another $100,000. Severance's Trammell Tillman makes Emmys history Getty Images Severance star Tramell Tillman, who plays the enigmatic Seth Milchick in Apple TV+'s mind-bending drama, became the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series in the award show's 77-year history. During his speech, Tillman dedicated the award to his mother, whom he described as his first acting coach. Speaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams. He said his character is a man that is aware of his race and place \"in the world of Lumon\" and was proud that he was able to \"elevate his story\" and \"practice authenticity\" on the show. Despite show being axed, a gracious Colbert thanks CBS Getty Images Colbert, whose late-night chat show The Late Show was cancelled by CBS earlier this year , offered up his vintage headshot and made a public plea for work when he took the stage as a presenter early in the telecast. He also received a standing ovation and rapturous chants of \"Stephen, Stephen!\" \"I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege of being part of the late night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,\" he said when he won the prize for outstanding talk series. Backstage, Colbert said he didn't yet have plans for his next big move, just that he was eager to get back to work on Tuesday. Hannah Einbinder speaks up about Gaza war Getty Images Hannah Einbinder of Hacks Hannah Einbinder of Hacks made one of the first major political statements of the telecast, closing her speech by condemning US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting \"Free Palestine\". Elaborating on her comments about the war in Gaza backstage afterwards, Einbinder said it was her \"obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the State of Israel.\" Days before the show, a group called Film Workers for Palestine proposed a boycott of what it called \"complicit Israeli film institutions and companies\" as more in Hollywood have spoken up against the war. Paramount - CBS' parent company - denounced the proposal and became the first major Hollywood studio to take a stance on the conflict. Signatories of the petition included Oscar-winner Javier Bardem, nominated for his role as Jose Menendez in Netflix's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. He wore a keffiyeh on the red carpet. Another statement came from Hacks and Too Much actress Megan Stalter, who carried a purse on the red carpet that bore a placard with \"Cease Fire!\" written on it.

Cooper, 15, was named best supporting actor in a limited series for his portrayal of a schoolboy accused of murdering a classmate. The four-part drama also won best limited series, as well as prizes for its directing and writing, and acting prizes for Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty . In his acceptance speech, Cooper said: \"Standing up here is just, wow, it's just so surreal. \"When I started these drama classes a couple of years back, I didn't expect to even be in the United States, never mind here.\" The winners and nominations in full Cash for speeches and big wins for The Pitt and The Studio - 7 Emmys highlights How Adolescence pulled off an Emmys sweep In pictures: Sydney Sweeney, Jenna Ortega and Selena Gomez on red carpet Cooper, who played teenager Jamie Miller, said: \"I think tonight proves if you listen, and you focus and you step out your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life. \"Who cares if you get embarrassed? Anything can be possible. I was nothing about three years ago, I'm here now.\" He also thanked his family, co-stars, and the show's production team, adding: \"It may have my name on this award, but it really belongs to the people behind the camera.\" Getty Images Cooper, 15, described his record-breaking win as \"surreal\" Cooper broke the record previously held by Scott Jacoby, who was 16 years old when he won a Primetime Emmy in 1973 for That Certain Summer. Roxana Zal remains the youngest acting winner overall. She was 14 when she won an Emmy in 1984 for Something About Amelia. Bindi Irwin is the youngest person to have won a Daytime Emmy, when she was nine. Getty Images Erin Doherty said making Adolescence had been \"the definition of a team effort\" 'Any dream is possible' - Stephen Graham Adolescence was widely praised by critics and viewers for its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers. In his acceptance speech for leading actor, Graham said: \"This kind of thing normally doesn't happen to a kid like me, I'm just a mixed-race kid from a block of flats in a place called Kirkby. \"So for me to be here today in front of my peers and be acknowledged by you is the most humbling thing I could ever imagine in my life, and it shows you that any dream is possible.\" Doherty, who played a child psychologist who works with Jamie, won best supporting actress in a limited series. The British actress joked she would be \"banging on about Owen Cooper and Adolescence for the rest of my life\". \"I'd love to mention every single person involved in making this show because it was the definition of a team effort,\" she added. Getty Images Stephen Graham won best lead actor in a limited series, as well as a prize for co-writing the drama Accepting the prize for outstanding writing earlier in the night, Graham said: \"We never expected our little programme to have such a big impact, but we're really grateful that it did.\" His co-writer Jack Thorne paid tribute to the show's young cast, telling them: \"You are the flame that proved young people are going to be OK.\" Earlier in the weekend, actor Jake Gyllenhaal surprised Cooper during an interview, after the young actor previously described him as his hero. In a clip that went viral on social media, Gyllenhaal gave Cooper the \"lucky duck\" which had originally been given to him when he was nominated for an Oscar. Watch: Owen Cooper's co-stars on his Adolescence audition and being in the spotlight so young (April 2025) The Studio breaks comedy record Other winners at the Emmys included Hollywood satire The Studio , which won several of the major comedy categories, including best actor for its star and creator Seth Rogen . The actor joked: \"I couldn't wrap my head around this happening, so I've prepared nothing. \"I never won anything in my life. When I was a kid I bought a used bowling trophy at an estate sale. This is really just so lovely.\" The Studio broke the record for the most wins by a comedy for a single series, winning 13 awards in total including those it took home at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys. Hacks and The Pitt stars triumph Getty Images The Pitt won best drama series, with Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle winning individual acting prizes Jean Smart repeated her win for best leading actress in a comedy for her performance in the satirical Hacks . Her co-star Hannah Einbinder also won an acting prize for the first time, taking home best supporting actress in a comedy. Einbinder thanked Smart and the show's crew for \"changing my life in every conceivable way\". On a night were several celebrities made direct or indirect references to the Israel-Gaza war, Einbinder finished her speech by saying: \"Free Palestine.\" Medical drama The Pitt won the prestigious best drama series award, while its stars Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle were recognised with individual acting prizes. But there were also wins in the drama categories for sci-fi thriller Severance , with acting prizes awarded to Britt Lower and Tramell Tillman , who became the first black winner of best supporting actor in a drama. Getty Images There were acting prizes in the drama categories for Severance stars Tramell Tillman (pictured) and Britt Lower Tillman dedicated his award to his mother, who he said was his \"first acting coach\". \"Mama, you were there for me when no-one else was, and no-one else would show up,\" he said. \"Your love and kindness stays with me, and this is for you.\" Departing Colbert's job plea Getty Images Stephen Colbert brought his old headshot as he said he was looking for work after the cancellation of The Late Show Meanwhile, Stephen Colbert won outstanding talk series, weeks after it was announced his show was being cancelled. His win came after a recent campaign, led by some of his fellow nominees such as Jimmy Kimmel, which encouraged Academy voters to support Colbert in the category this year. \"Thank you for this honour,\" Colbert said. \"I want to thank CBS for giving us to be art of the privilege of late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we've stopped doing this show.\" Colbert also received a standing ovation while presenting an award earlier in the night. He joked: \"While I have your attention, is anyone hiring? Because I've got 200 very well qualified candidates here with me tonight, who will be available in June.\" Charity boost Elsewhere, the US version of The Traitors won outstanding reality competition programme. Its host Alan Cumming paid tribute to the show's \"crew in Scotland who had to understand the concept that the Scottish summer is sometimes oxymoronic\". He added: \"It's a difficult time that we live in but it's so great that our show brings a little bit of joy into this life.\" Other winners included Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , which took home two prizes including best scripted variety series; Star Wars spin-off Andor , which won best drama writing; and Slow Horses , which won a directing prize. The Emmys ceremony unusually ran broadly on schedule, ending only a few minutes late. That was party due to a clever policy employed by host Nate Bargatze, who started the night by saying a $100,000 donation he was making to charity would be reduced for every speech that went over the time limit, while every short speech would add more money to the fund. But despite the amount of money going up and down throughout the night, the ceremony ended with him and broadcast network CBS announcing they would, in fact, donate $250,000 in total to US charity The Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

It was not a rubber bullet. If you see my son, his head was broken, a hole is there.\" Narendra Shrestha wants to know who will take responsibility for the death of his son Sulov, who was among scores killed in violent unrest that rocked Nepal last week. Mr Shrestha, 45, is perched outside the gates of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital's mortuary in the capital. He's already been inside and identified 21-year-old Sulov's body. \"I want to ask this country,\" he says, choking back tears, \"if they can fire, they can shoot my son, then I and his mother, will also stand. Who will we live for now? We also want to die.\" A female family member sits beside him, holding his hand, while a man protects him from the beating sun with an umbrella. Other families were also waiting to identify their young loved ones whose lives were cut short: one had dreamed of being a judge, another was a student working in a Kathmandu hotel, a third was learning French. They are among more than 70 people who died in anti-corruption protests at the start of last week, which toppled the government of the Himalayan nation. More than 1,000 were injured in the two days of unrest. Pritam Roy Narendra Shrestha says his son was shot in the head: \"Who will we live for now?\" A ban on social media was the impetus for the protests, but anger against government corruption had been building in recent weeks. By the time the ban was reversed late on Monday, 8 September, the protests had swelled into a wider movement. Crowds torched politicians' homes and official buildings as an outpouring of anger at the ruling class boiled over. Many of those killed were shot - police are accused of opening fire on the crowds. But others were burned in fires or died in confrontations with police. Casualty figures have been going up as authorities clean up the debris. In response to the allegations, Nepal's police have said they will investigate what happened during those two days of violent protests. It's still unclear who gave the orders for security forces to open fire. Family handout There are several families like Mr Shrestha's waiting outside the mortuary for their names to be called so they can identify the bodies. One man, Rasik KC, is waiting for the body of his 22-year-old nephew, Rashik Khatiwada. Rashik was shot twice in the chest, Mr KC says. He found out about the death after seeing clips on social media. His anguish has now turned to anger, demanding some kind of accountability from the government. \"We want justice,\" he says. Family handout Abhishek Chaulagain, 22, was shot in the forehead The BBC spoke with more than a dozen people who lost family members in the protests. The relatives of Subash Bohora, 21, said there was a time in his life when he wanted to be a judge. He died outside Nepal's parliament building after a bullet pierced his neck. Ayush Thapa, 19, was a French language student who was interested in the British Army and hated Nepali politicians, his family says. He was shot in the chest. Abishek Chaulagain, 22, was a student working in one of the capital's hotels when he was shot in the forehead. \"We had never come across a disaster like this,\" says Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu. She says they treated more than 450 patients in their emergency room during the protests. Six people died. \"Our hospital [has been] in operation for 17 years. We were able to manage patients during the earthquake. [This] situation was worse.\" On the first night of protests, Dr Santosh Paudel was working at Bir Hospital, not far from the parliament building. Of the 173 patients his team treated in the hospital's emergency ward, five died and four are still in critical condition. Dr Paudel says he was surprised to see patients with \"sharp rifle injuries\" in addition to rubber bullets. \"We saw [two types of bullets] clearly, the long one, which is fired by shotguns, and the small ones with the sharp edge that is fired from rifles,\" said Dr Paudel. He said many of the patients that came later in the day had multiple bullet injuries. Pritam Roy Parliament was attacked and images of it set ablaze were seen around the world Protests began last Monday when thousands heeded a call by demonstrators describing themselves as Generation Z to gather near parliament in Kathmandu over the decision to ban platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, as well as over wider dissatisfaction with the government. Ministers said police had to use force, which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Saying they'd failed to register locally, the government announced social media platforms needed to be regulated to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. But popular platforms such as Instagram have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business – and protesters accused the government of trying to silence them. By Tuesday, violent crowds were setting fire to government buildings in the capital Kathmandu. Parliament was torched even though Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already resigned. Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki has a tough road ahead. Not only does the 73-year-old former chief justice need to appoint a new cabinet, she must rebuild confidence in the country's leadership. She has agreed to fresh elections on 5 March 2026, but the first real test of her new government will be her investigation into the protests and if she can bring the perpetrators of the deadly violence – including those who shot protesters, as well as those behind the widespread vandalism – to justice. Pritam Roy \"International law says they are not allowed to shoot,\" says Abishek Shrestha, 22, from his hospital bed, his home for the next month. Metal rods protrude from the white and pink gauze wrapped around his right leg, where he was shot. \"I'm Nepali and they are not allowed to shoot me, but they shot me. It's all because of the government, police, rules and regulation. We have to change this.\" An investigation is little comfort to Mr Shrestha as he mourns Sulov. \"Politicians, they will say sorry. Sorry doesn't make a dead son come alive again.\" Additional reporting by Charlotte Scarr Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated Asia Nepal Related Private zoo run by billionaire Ambani family cleared of 'foul play' India's top court suspends parts of contentious Muslim property law Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager More from the BBC 1 day ago Nepal's interim PM to hand over power within six months Sushila Karki said the government must heed protesters' demands for \"an end to corruption, good governance and economic equality\". 1 day ago 2 days ago Nepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstated The House of Representatives was dissolved by the country's president, following deadly anti-corruption protests. 2 days ago 3 days ago Nepal gets first female PM after deadly unrest Former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki is sworn in after a deal with protest leaders. 3 days ago 4 days ago Worried migrants head home from India after Nepal turmoil Nepalis rush home from India as deadly protests have engulfed the Himalayan nation. 4 days ago 4 days ago See Kathmandu's destroyed and barricaded streets after violence There's an intense military presence on the Nepali capital's streets, says the BBC's Samira Hussain. 4 days ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

There are giant explosions as Sukhoi-34 bombers drop guided bombs. Huge plumes of smoke darken the sky. The whole area echoes to the sound of exploding mortar and artillery shells. Helicopter gunships join the attack, while surveillance drones sweep overhead to view the damage. It's only an exercise, though. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says the drills come at a time of \"high tension\" Together with other international media we've been brought to the Borisovsky training ground where Belarusian and Russian forces are taking part in joint manoeuvres. It's part of the Zapad-2025 (\"West 2025\") military drills. Military attachés, too, from a variety of embassies are observing the drill from a viewing platform. These are planned exercises - \"West 2025\" takes place every four years. In 2022 200,000 troops took part, while this year's exercises involved fewer soldiers. Moscow and Minsk maintain that the drills are of a purely defensive nature, that they're designed to strengthen the security of Russia and Belarus and to counter any potential external threat. I remember hearing similar claims three and a half years ago. In February 2022 I visited Belarus to report on the Belarusian-Russian military exercise \"Union Resolve\". When the exercise was over, instead of returning home Russian troops invaded neighbouring Ukraine from the territory of Belarus. This time Belarus insists it has nothing to hide. Representatives of 23 states, including the US, Turkey and Hungary, watched the military exercise. \"We consider that the exercise is unprecedented in its transparency,\" Major General Valery Revenko, assistant to the Belarusian defence minister, told journalists at the training ground. \"We are not threatening anyone. We are for constructive and pragmatic dialogue.\" Clearly Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk isn't convinced. He had dubbed the \"West 2025\" drills \"very aggressive\". Poland shut its border with Belarus ahead of the exercises, prompting an angry response from Minsk. \"West 2025\" coincides with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European region. To the south, Russia shows no sign of ending its war on Ukraine. Last week Poland accused Russia of intentionally violating its air space with a Russian drone incursion. Nato scrambled fighter jets to shoot down some of the drones. Moscow responded by claiming that it \"hadn't planned to engage targets on Polish territory.\" Yesterday Romania revealed that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, too. In Europe there is widespread concern that such drone incursions are no accident , but a Russian strategy to test the unity and resolve of European leaders and of the Nato alliance. Both Russia and Belarus have made efforts recently to improve ties with Washington and to construct a relationship with the Trump administration. But in the case of both Moscow and Minsk relations with Europe remain strained. The decision by the Belarusian authorities to invite international media to the \"West 2025\" exercise can be seen two ways. First, as an attempt at transparency - that's certainly how Minsk is portraying it. But in the explosions and the gunfire on the Borisovsky training ground there is, perhaps too, a message for the West. And first and foremost, for Europe.

The 65-year-old has worked the fields since he was a teenager. He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects. \"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company. He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs. \"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\" Bloomberg via Getty Images American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, in part due to economic tensions with China His fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops. American farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July. With all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening. Rural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis. Polling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular. 'I'm in a little bit of a worried place:' Tim Maxwell owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa Mr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says. \"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\" So why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy? Farmers on a 'trade and financial precipice' If you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days. There is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar. But when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs. Anna Jones at the Iowa State Fair where there was much talk about the impact of tariffs \"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine. \"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\" In April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China. In response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China. Last year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock. September is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year. The Iowa State Fair attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days Tariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University. \"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\" The cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser. Jon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States… \"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke. \"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\" Farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", sell a huge number of crops to China American farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency. In a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\" Trump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day' Supporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture. And they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance. In his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\" Getty Images Supporters of Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\". \"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\" And it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. But he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts. \"That is a problem.\" Tariffs will make us great again There's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances. Yet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump. Experts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole. Though a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small. \"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics. At Iowa's State Fair, many of the conversations revolved around Trump and tariffs (pictured: attendee John Wilson with Judah the Big Ram) For some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run. \"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa. \"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\" Some may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China. A case of selective blame attribution? For Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play. \"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\" Starting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change. What he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\". Bloomberg via Getty Images Rural America: the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump, says one expert Some repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\". \"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\". Ms Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\" Prof Shepherd, of the University of Michigan, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side. He calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\" 'We're giving him a chance - there'd better be results' Mr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\" But he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return. Many of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support. 'A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,' farmer Gil Gullickson (left). 'But history proves that tariffs don't end well' Mr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under. Back at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear. \"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less. \"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\" Listen to Corn Belt People on BBC Radio 4 at 4pm bst on Monday 15 September Additional reporting: Florence Freeman Trump is used to shaking off criticism - but the Epstein story is different The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation How Trump is using the courts to get what he wants - and changing the shape of presidential power Trump tariffs Agriculture Iowa Rural life Donald Trump US politics Related China accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly laws Brazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffs AstraZeneca pauses £200m Cambridge investment More from the BBC 2 hrs ago Marine officers search river ahead of Trump visit Specialist marine officers increase patrols ahead of the US president's visit to Windsor. 2 hrs ago 3 hrs ago Trump renews push to end companies' quarterly reports The US president urges regulators to adopt a semi-annual schedule for financial reports. 3 hrs ago 4 hrs ago Democratic New York governor endorses Zohran Mamdani for NYC mayor Some establishment Democrats have been uneasy about the 33-year-old's left-wing platform. 4 hrs ago 5 hrs ago Trump says Venezuela 'sending drugs, gang members' as tensions rise Tension has been running high between the two countries since the US deployed war ships to the South Caribbean. 5 hrs ago 10 hrs ago Trump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel manager Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah was attacked with a machete by his co-worker, who is an illegal Cuban immigrant. 10 hrs ago British Broadcasting Corporation Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather BBC Shop BritBox BBC in other languages Follow BBC on: Terms of Use About the BBC Privacy Policy Cookies Accessibility Help Contact the BBC Advertise with us Do not share or sell my info BBC.com Help & FAQs Content Index Copyright 2025 BBC.

Here's how to fix it 19 hours ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save BBC When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks. Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode. This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness. Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, and conditions such as long Covid and autoimmune conditions like lupus disease, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind at once. Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze. 1. Be kind to yourself Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping. Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched. Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it. If you are concerned then you should contact your GP. 2. Create routines Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory. Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\" It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making. 3. Take breaks Getty Images Taking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focus It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room. But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely. Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly. Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next. 4. Use calendars and reminders Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness. Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space. Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores. This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\" Swans Getty Images Staying hydrated and eating whole foods can help clear brain fog Alongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen focus. Each letter stands for a key habit that can help clear the mental mist and keep your mind performing at its best: Sleep: Sleep is non-negotiable - it gives your brain time to rest and consolidate memories. Aim for between seven and nine hours each night. Water: Our bodies are about 60% water and even mild dehydration can make you feel unfocused so keep water nearby and sip it regularly Activity : Moving your body boosts blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which helps you think more clearly. Try going on short walks, a light jog or regularly stretching Nutrition: Nourish your brain with whole foods rather than processed ones. Choline is a nutrient vital for brain health so eating food that is rich in it like eggs, fish and nuts can support concentration and focus. Stress: Chronic stress floods the body with cortisol - a hormone that helps regulate your body's response to stress - and that can cloud your thinking. Find ways to lower stress through breathing exercises, mindfulness and hobbies. Use the NHS website to find out more about brain fog and how to manage it. Feeling stressed?

Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to. Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests. Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker. Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels. At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network. Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts. We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further. Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request. Outside of the UK you can watch on YouTube One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda. She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022. \"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us. Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. \"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. \"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia. \"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her. Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. \"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent. \"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. \"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations. Warsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022 Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business. Mr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver \"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\". When asked about \"Dubai porta potty\" he replied: \"I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have.\" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. \"I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me.\" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run. Troy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa He says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. \"I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents.\" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. \"She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,\" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022. Instagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died Monic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: \"I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. \"[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,\" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation. Instagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building Kayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as \"The Unknown\". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. \"We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,\" she told us. Monic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life For Monic's family, grief is now tangled with fear. Fear for other families who could suffer the same loss they have, if nothing is done. \"We are all looking at Monica's death,\" her relative Michael told us. \"But who is there for the girls still alive? They're still there. Still suffering.\" The BBC asked Charles \"Abbey\" Mwesigwa to respond to all the allegations made in our investigation. He denied running an illegal prostitution ring. He said: \"These are all false allegations. \"I told you I am just a party person who invites big spenders on my tables, hence making many girls flock [to] my table. That makes me know many girls and that's it.\" He also said: \"[Monic] died with her passport meaning no-one was demanding her money for taking her. Prior to her death, I hadn't seen her for over four to five weeks. \"I knew [Monic and Kayla] and [they] were renting with different landlords. If no-one in both flats was arrested or any of the landlords, then there was a reason. Both incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and maybe they can help you.\" The BBC contacted Al Barsha Police Station to request to see the case files for Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi. It did not respond to that request or to allegations Monica and Kayla's deaths had not been properly investigated. The BBC was unable to see any toxicology reports in relation to Monic Karungi, or speak to the landlord of the apartment in which she was living when she died.

They are the first children to be brought to the UK for treatment as part of a government operation being co-ordinated by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Home Office and Department of Health. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the children had been evacuated from Gaza in an interview with the Daily Mirror newspaper. A Foreign Office source told the BBC the report was correct and the children were due to arrive in the UK in the \"coming days\". The UK government is also working to evacuate students with places to study at British universities. Cooper did not confirm how large the first group was but the BBC understands it contains between 30 and 50 Palestinian children . Each child could be accompanied by family members if necessary, according to the Mirror . Cooper told the newspaper \"it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza\". She added: \"But that work is underway and I'm determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn.\" Some Gazan children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government until now had not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict. On Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 47 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day. Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said that Israel's offensive in Gaza had stretched the territory's health system \"beyond breaking point\" . Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths. The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,803 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

He'll get a spectacular royal welcome but no cheering crowds 2 days ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save BBC US President Donald Trump is going to be greeted with a spectacular royal charm offensive during his state visit this week. The aim will be to dazzle and flatter him with the ultimate red-carpet experience, with guards of honour, flypasts, historic carriages, a lavish banquet, pomp and pageantry. In return, Sir Keir Starmer will be hoping this gilt-edged reception will help to deliver the UK's message on awkward issues such as Ukraine and trade tariffs. And if anyone can get the US president's attention and influence him, surely King Charles III and the Royal Family can. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II greeted the President and First Lady on the state visit to the UK in 2019 But how will King Charles handle his sometimes unpredictable guest in Windsor? Can he be the Trump whisperer? \"Trump loves the monarchy and the Royal Family. It's a potential diplomatic ace card for the UK government,\" says Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the modern monarchy at City St George's, University of London. This attraction to royalty will give the King a \"rare advantage\" in dealing with Trump, who usually expects to have the upper hand, says Prof Whitelock. Sir Anthony Seldon, biographer of the UK's prime ministers, agrees. The King can benefit from Trump's \"palpable enthusiasm\" for the royals, he says. \"At the same time, King Charles is in the most delicate of positions. His own known views, on the environment, and standing up for democracy and the rule of law in Europe, are a long way apart from the president's,\" says Sir Anthony. \"He will, I am sure, be scrupulously correct and civil,\" he adds. In essence, the King will stick to the script given to him by the UK government. The government will certainly hope that this week's royal schmooze-fest will make a positive impression on Trump, creating a feelgood factor for the UK. It's an unusual and carefully crafted state visit. There's a crammed schedule squeezed into a day and a half, most of it dedicated to royal spectacles. Windsor is being used like a royal theme park. With fears over security and protests, there won't be any cheering crowds and no public procession, like the one recently enjoyed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Instead, it will be helicopters and closed events, including the carriage ride, which will wind its way inside the Windsor estate. A YouGov poll over the summer showed opinion divided on whether Trump's visit should go ahead , with slightly more wanting it cancelled. And the nearest thing to the public that the president will see will be the staff working at the banquet. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images The King has shown his public support for Ukraine's President Zelensky The King will make a speech in honour of the president at the state banquet in St George's Hall, inside Windsor Castle. He's likely to praise the special relationship and talk of the anniversaries of wartime alliances, perhaps mentioning his mother, the late Queen, and Trump's mother, who so admired royalty. Every word will have been written in close consultation with the government, anxious to hit the right notes. Guests, including many celebrity faces, will dine on a showcase of US and British food, from a menu written in French, with five or six different glasses for each place, in a hall lined with royal portraits and suits of armour. Charles has decades of experience at playing host. Whatever his own private thoughts - and he's not exactly going to be signed up to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" message - the King has a strong sense of duty and will work hard to make this visit a success. Royal author Robert Hardman suggests they'll stick to safe topics - such as talking about the president's Scottish roots. And the royals have, of course, had plenty of visits from people with whom they might not have seen eye-to-eye. Mr Hardman describes how the late Queen Elizabeth II once hid behind a bush rather than bump into Romania's President Caecescu in the palace gardens, during the dictator's state visit in 1978. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images There will be no public carriage rides for the US visit, unlike for President Macron The King is also not alone. The rest of the Royal Family will be deployed to help with the hospitality. All eyes will be on Catherine, the Princess of Wales, and the First Lady, Melania Trump, when they visit a nature project involving the Scouts on Thursday. Trump is also an admirer of Prince William, praising their \"great, great talk\" in France at the re-opening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral. William and Catherine will be an important part of the ceremonial welcome on Wednesday. Queen Camilla will show Melania one of the quirkier items in Windsor, a remarkable dolls' house, made a century ago by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. If things get too tough, the miniature wine bottles in the dolls' house have real drink inside. Getty Images The Princess of Wales at the state banquet for Trump in 2019 While King Charles and Trump might seem contrasting personalities, they're very much known quantities to each other. They're men of the same post-war generation - Trump aged 79 and the King aged 76 - who have overlapped for decades. As far back as the late-1980s, Charles had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. After Trump survived an assassination attempt last July, the King sent him a personal note . They spent time together during Trump's previous state visit in 2019. And it's also not just the two heads of state who have crossed paths, but their families. Before Trump had taken a run at the White House, his businessman brother Robert, who died in 2020, had been a significant donor to Charles's charities, bringing him to royal dinners in the UK, along with other wealthy US socialites. The King's brother, Prince Andrew, had visited Mar-a-Lago in 2000, introducing himself as \"Andrew York\" to guests. Jeffrey Epstein, later convicted as a sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the same party. Prince Andrew will be entirely airbrushed out of this week's visit. But for Trump's 2019 visit, he was described as Buckingham Palace's \"secret weapon\", accompanying the president on two of the three days. That was only a matter of months before the Duke of York's notorious Newsnight interview. Trump clearly relished meeting the late Queen Elizabeth II and he'll pay his respects to her, laying a wreath on her tomb in St George's Chapel. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Sir Keir Starmer handed over the historic invitation to a second state visit Trump's fascination with the monarchy is at the heart of this state visit. As with much about the president, it's about his personality more than his politics. \"I still remember my mother, who is Scottish by birth, sitting in front of the television set to watch Queen Elizabeth's coronation and not budging for an entire day. She was just enthralled by the pomp and circumstance, the whole idea of royalty and glamour,\" Trump recalled in his book The Art of the Deal. \"I also remember my father that day, pacing around impatiently. 'For Christ's sake Mary,' he'd say. 'Enough is enough, turn it off.'\" It seems to be his mother's voice that he listened to. \"A meeting with the Queen of England was the ultimate sign, that he, Trump, had made it in life,\" wrote his former Russia adviser Fiona Hill in her White House memoir. For Trump, getting close to a King or Queen seems to have been the ultimate way for an outsider to become an insider. Offering him a second state visit has been called \"unprecedented\". And it is very rare, although Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik of Denmark also had two, in 1974 and 2000. Since the start of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 1952, there have only been three state visits by US presidents - George W Bush, Barack Obama and Trump - who is the only one who has had two. There have been other presidential trips to the UK, but not fully-fledged state visits. The significance of that shouldn't be underestimated and it reflects how much Trump dominates the international news agenda. For the UK government, his apparent fandom for the royals creates an opportunity to make its own pitch to Trump. Getty Images The King and PM Mark Carney asserted Canada's independence from US claims It's an important moment for King Charles, who used to be criticised for \"meddling\" in politics. Now he's in the unusual position of being actively encouraged to play a role in diplomatic negotiations. Soft power is being applied to tough times. It was the King who embraced Ukraine's President Zelensky after his White House mauling in February. And it was the King who went to Canada in May to show solidarity when it was under pressure from Trump to become his 51st state. Charles appears to have been effective. Former Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Jeremy Kinsman, said the intervention had been \"outstanding\" and Trump seems to have reduced his aggressive rhetoric. The King has also received warm support and standing ovations after speeches to the parliaments of France, Italy and Germany. Charles is a bridge-builder in an era when populist politicians are burning them down. Yet issues such as protecting Ukraine are personally and deeply held by the King. \"I imagine it is an uncomfortable moment for the King,\" adds Mr Kinsman. \"I cannot imagine two men more utterly different in values, purpose, style, and psychology.\" Mr Kinsman, the former professional diplomat, says the King will have been briefed to \"play the genial host and continue to try to charm the US president and impress him with the majesty of the setting\". In turn, he says Trump will be on best behaviour and he will have been briefed and ready for small talk on topics such as organic farming. \"The King will know what to expect and I'm confident he will handle the president very diplomatically,\" royal commentator Pauline Maclaran says. \"The chemistry between them will be very interesting.\" More weekend picks Inside King Charles's fiery gathering that shone a light on his beliefs Prince Andrew book seals his fate for any return King's big moment in Canada after Trump row Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Business Secretary Peter Kyle said marchers were demonstrating freedom of association and freedom of speech, after up to 150,000 joined a \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally, organised by Robinson and about 5,000 took part in a counter-protest, co-ordinated by Stand Up To Racism. But he told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg the \"small minority\" who had committed violence would be held accountable. Police say 26 officers were injured on the day - including four who were seriously hurt - with 24 people arrested. Who is Tommy Robinson? Dozens of officers injured as up to 150,000 join Tommy Robinson rally 'People are angry': Behind the wave of asylum hotel protests Speaking about Saturday's protests, Kyle said moments like these were \"klaxon calls\" for those in power to redouble their efforts to address the big concerns people have, including on immigration. \"What worries me most is the divisions in our society and other societies and other democratic societies... it's not even the left and the right at the moment,\" he told the programme. \"There are figures such as Tommy Robinson that are able to touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in the community in our society,\" he said. \"A lot of it goes back to its roots in the financial crisis and the impact that had on communities around the country, and we haven't been able to bring our communities back together again since,\" Kyle continued. Kyle criticised Elon Musk's comments after he appeared at Saturday's rally via video link telling protesters to \"fight back\" or \"die\". \"I thought that they were slightly incomprehensible comments that were totally inappropriate\", the minister said. The tech billionaire also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK. Met Police officers clash with protesters at Tommy Robinson rally Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, criticised politicians for \"parroting\" his ideas as he addressed the crowds from a stage. He claimed UK courts had decided the rights of undocumented migrants superseded those of the \"local community\", referring to the Court of Appeal decision last month to overturn an injunction blocking asylum seekers being housed at The Bell Hotel in Essex. Central London saw a huge policing operation for the protests this weekend, with around 1,000 officers deployed. Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said officers said: \"There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence.\" The protest was largely peaceful on Saturday lunchtime but as the afternoon continued tensions flared. The Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart and dozens of officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt. Protesters joining the march, organised by Robinson, became too big to fit into Whitehall, police said, and confrontation happened when officers tried to stop them encircling counter-protesters. Mounted police officers used batons to push back the crowds and officers were kicked and punched, said the Met. Three of the 24 people arrested were women and the rest were men, while the youngest and oldest people detained at the protest were aged 19 and 58 respectively, the Met said on Sunday. Several people were arrested for more than one offence. The force added officers were working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests \"in the coming days and weeks. The Met said on Saturday morning that they were not going to use live facial recognition cameras during the day. Previously called a \"game-changing tool\" by Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, the technology is used by the force in \"hotspot policing\" and major events like the Notting Hill Carnival. Robinson was released from prison earlier this year after being jailed in October for ignoring an order not to repeat false claims about a Syrian refugee , who had successfully sued him for libel.

The prime minister is believed to have asked Mandelson three questions, via an email sent by his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, relating to his friendship with the disgraced financier while he was being considered for the influential role. The questions came after initial vetting of the peer flagged his relationship with Epstein. The revelation is likely to pile further scrutiny on what Sir Keir knew before Mandelson got the job. While his friendship with Epstein was known at the time of his appointment, No 10 said new information about it only came to light this week, prompting his sacking. Downing Street and Mandelson have declined to comment. Mandelson was asked to leave his post on Thursday after a now notorious cache of emails was reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday evening. These included supportive messages Mandelson sent after Epstein had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. In one message, Mandelson is reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" and, the day before he began his prison sentence, another which read: \"I think the world of you.\" These emails did not show up in two vetting processes carried out in Whitehall around his appointment. When Mandelson was under consideration for ambassador, the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET) prepared a file for the prime minister that contained information about Mandelson and Epstein's links, the BBC has been told. After reviewing the file, No 10 sources say Sir Keir asked Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Peter Mandelson was sacked as UK ambassador to the US this week These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed? It is understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009, while the paedophile was in prison. Another source confirmed Mandelson told Downing Street he had not stayed there. Court documents in 2023 showed Epstein telling his private banker that Mandelson was planning to stay, but the peer has never explicitly denied or confirmed if he did. No 10 sources believe Mandelson was \"economical with the truth\" in his answers to the three questions. However, at the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed which led to a second vetting process, called \"developed vetting\" (DV), being carried out under the auspices of the Foreign Office. The BBC has been told the emails were not available to those in government when Lord Mandelson was appointed, as they came from a defunct email address. A senior Whitehall figure said it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done. The row has led to growing pressure on Sir Keir over his judgement in making Mandelson ambassador, and questions over the extent of what he knew about ties between Mandelson and Epstein. Some Labour MPs in public and private are asking whether Sir Keir should resign, and some are suggesting Number 10 senior aides are to blame. Sources have told the BBC that Mandelson was asked to resign on Wednesday, even though the prime minister had backed him at PMQs. Mandelson refused, and after a \"furious\" Sir Keir read the emails on Wednesday night, a final decision to sack him was taken on Thursday morning. The Cabinet Office has declined to comment. Mandelson has repeatedly expressed regret about his relationship with Epstein who died in jail in 2019.

The 'one in, one out' pilot scheme was set up as part of a deal announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to the UK in July. Dozens of migrants were detained in Dover last month under the agreement and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said this week that they are are expected to be returned to France \"imminently\". It is understood that formal removal directions have been issued to asylum seekers to say they will be deported to France within five days. In return, it was agreed that the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers who have not tried to cross and can pass security and eligibility checks. At the announcement in early July, Starmer said the plan was a \"product of months of grown-up diplomacy \" which would \"deliver real results\". Critics, including the Conservatives, argue the policy would prove \"unworkable and wide open to abuse\". It is also understood that MPs will get a chance to question new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on the deal during Home Office questions in Parliament on Monday. As of 13 September, 31,027 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025, up from 22,440 for the same period in 2024. Under the new treaty, published on 4 August , France agreed to take back adults or accompanied children who make a journey to the UK by small boat, once any asylum claim is withdrawn or declared inadmissible. Both countries have agreed to work towards making transfers with three months after small boat arrivals have entered the UK. Former home secretary Yvette Cooper stressed the scheme starting up was a trial . Details of how people will apply to come to the UK from France under the treaty have also been published by the government. Successful applicants will initially be granted the right to come to the UK for three months, to \"consider how to regularise their stay\". Applicants will apply online – but have to submit proof to the Home Office they are applying from within France. The UK has agreed to pay the transportation costs both of those migrants it sends to France, and those it accepts back in return. A decade of small boat migrants: How did it begin? Why do Channel migrants want to come to the UK? Record number of lone children on small boats The policy is part of a number of measures unveiled by the Labour government in an attempt to tackle the small boats crossings from France. In July, it announced that 25 people including gang leaders and small boat suppliers had had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. An extra 300 National Crime Agency officers will target the people-smugglers arranging the crossings, and a new Border Security Command body will work closely with the Home office, police, immigration enforcement and intelligence agencies. The UK is also paying France almost £500m over three years - as agreed by the previous Conservative government - to fund extra officers on the French coast.

The Reform UK leader said the money used to purchase the property was \"legally hers\", adding: \"She bought the house, the deeds are in her name, council tax is in her name.\" It comes after a BBC investigation raised questions over how Farage's partner, Laure Ferrari, could afford to buy the £885,000 home in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, without a mortgage. Farage has denied avoiding more than £44,000 in additional stamp duty on the purchase of the house by putting it in his partner's name, saying that she bought it with her own funds. Stamp duty is a tax paid when buying a property over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. There is a higher rate if the buyer already own another property and this would have been due if Farage had purchased the Clacton house himself. Farage has suggested Ms Ferrari was able to afford the four-bedroom home because she comes from a wealthy French family. However, the BBC has examined French property and company records and has been unable to find evidence that Ms Ferrari's parents have the means to fund their daughter's purchase of the home. Ms Ferrari herself is the director of a consultancy, now called Baxter Laois Limited, which is the registered owner of Farage's gin brand. However, the company's latest accounts show limited activity, with more than £10,000 owed to creditors and just £1,000 in assets. If the Reform leader was the source of funds used for the home, which he has denied, it would be legal for his partner to use them to buy the property in her name and pay the lower rate of stamp duty. But it would open Farage to charges of hypocrisy and seeking to avoid tax, particularly after he criticised former Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner last week for avoiding stamp duty . Farage faces questions over who funded £885,000 Clacton constituency home We must be ready for early election, Nigel Farage tells party What is stamp duty? Asked if he earned any of the money used by his partner to buy the house, Farage told reporters on Friday: \"No. No, no, no, listen, can I be clear about this. The money was legally hers, the estate agents and everyone did the know your customer rule checks.\" He added: \"I don't have any financial stake in it whatsoever, other than she lets me stay there but then given that I'm her partner that's not really that unusual.\" Pressed over whether he had given his partner funds at any point, the Clacton MP said: \"I have given every answer to this I want to give. \"I've even been this week to a King's Counsel tax expert and paid a lot of money to make sure that everything we've done is legal and right.\" Asked why he had sought expert tax advice, Farage said he was \"really concerned\" that some media reports were \"beginning to stray into libel territory\". \"So I have now done everything I can at every level to prove that everything that's been done is legal, correct and right,\" he added. \"It's been a very expensive week.\" Following his election as the MP for Clacton last year, Farage claimed in a series of interviews that he had bought a house in his constituency. In response to questions last November about how many times he had been to Clacton, Farage said he had \"just exchanged contracts on a house that I'll be living in there\". It later emerged that the £885,000 home had been bought by his partner Ms Ferrari, who is listed on Land Registry documents as the sole owner. It was bought without borrowing any money for a mortgage. Labour has accused Farage of \"misleading the public\", with party chairwoman Anna Turley previously saying he must \"urgently come clean\" over whether he financially contributed towards the purchase of the house. Farage's solicitors said they had received written advice from a leading King's Counsel tax expert which concluded there was no underpayment of stamp duty and that \"there is no basis to suggest there has been any improper avoidance or evasion of tax in respect of the purchase\".

Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US on Thursday over his links to the late convicted paedophile. The government said the \"depth and extent\" of Mandelson's relationship with the financier had not been known when he was appointed last year. This is the first time financial evidence of Epstein paying for Mandelson's travel has come to light. The BBC has contacted Mandelson for a response. Just months after Mandelson contributed a 10-page note to Epstein's 2003 \"50th birthday book\", in which he referred to Epstein as his \"best pal\" , Epstein paid for Mandelson's travel. It is unclear where and when Mandelson's travel took place. The first travel payment by Epstein is dated 4 April 2003 - before he was convicted in 2008 - and cost $3,844.90. A week later, Epstein paid a further $3,642.06. The travel receipts were among more than the 33,000 Epstein-related records released earlier this month by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee, provided by the Department of Justice. The documents show Epstein's financial account with a New York travel agent, Shoppers Travel Inc, which was used by Epstein to book commercial flights for his associates and employees. Victims also allege to have been flown commercially by Epstein in this way. In emails from October 2005, reported by Bloomberg on Wednesday, Mandelson is said to have complained to Epstein about a lack of British Airways airmiles and Epstein offered to pay for his Caribbean flight. Mandelson is reported to have told Epstein to \"fight for early release\" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The Labour peer and former cabinet minister also told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before he began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Mandelson does not deny these emails. In a previous statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\" In a letter Mandelson wrote to staff at the British embassy in Washington after being sacked, he said he \"deeply regrets\" the circumstances around his departure and continues \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims\". Epstein was convicted in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18 in 2008. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

Sources stressed Sir Keir was not aware of the contents of the emails when he stood by Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. The BBC understands that a media enquiry outlining details of the messages between the pair was sent to the Foreign Office on Tuesday, and passed on to No 10. Sir Oliver Robbins, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, asked Lord Mandelson about the emails on Tuesday but did not receive a response until the next day. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of lying to the public. She said: \"Looks like the prime minister and Labour MPs spent the week lying to the whole country about what they knew regarding Mandelson's involvement with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \"If No10 had those emails for 48 hours before acting, it means he lied at PMQs and ministers lied again about new additional information. These are yet more errors of judgement\". Backbench Labour MP Olivia Blake called No 10's reported handling of the situation \"really embarrassing\". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday: \"Any operation that fails to tell a prime minister when something as substantial as those emails were presented to them clearly has deep failings.\" Blake added: \"Whoever is gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop, and they need to be getting things to him much earlier so that he can get on top of it.\" Asked whether Lord Mandelson should be required to leave the House of Lords, Blake said it was something \"we should be considering\". Downing Street later said the prime minister \"strongly\" rejected criticism of the leadership in No 10 from some of his MPs. Starmer maintained full confidence in his \"top team\" and was \"focused on delivering for the country,\" they said. Downing Street also rejected claims the prime minister is failing to engage with MPs, saying he meets with backbenchers \"regularly\" and pointing to a meeting held on Monday night, which they say was \"positive\". Badenoch also said the prime minister had \"very serious questions to answer\". \"The only way to clear this up is full transparency about who knew what, and when,\" she added. Lord Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US shortly before 11:00 on Thursday. Downing Street said the emails contained \"new information\" that was not known at the time of Lord Mandelson's appointment. United States District Court Southern District of New York A picture understood to have been taken on the Caribbean island of St Barts in 2006 The full emails were published by Bloomberg and the Sun on Wednesday evening. \"I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,\" Mandelson wrote the day before Epstein reported to prison in 2008 for soliciting sex from a minor. Mandelson added: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release... Your friends stay with you and love you.\" In an interview with the Sun on Wednesday, Lord Mandelson said he felt a \"tremendous sense of regret\" that he had met Epstein, and that he \"took at face value the lies that he fed me and many others\". The BBC earlier reported that Lord Mandelson's emails were sent from an old account to which he no longer had access. Officials cite this as the reason they had not been seen earlier. In a statement announcing Lord Mandelson's dismissal, the Foreign Office said: \"The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.\" Following his sacking, Mandelson said being the UK's ambassador to the US had been \"the privilege of my life\". It comes as Sir Keir faces growing pressure over his handling of Lord Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to the US. Labour MP Clive Lewis, an outspoken voice on the Labour left, said Sir Keir \"doesn't seem up to the job\" , adding that there was a \"very, very dangerous atmosphere\" among Labour MPs. Another Labour MP Jo White said the \"clock is ticking\" for Sir Keir to turn polls around before local elections next May. Labour MP Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs committee, has written to the new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper asking for details on the vetting process for Lord Mandelson's appointment, and whether security concerns were dismissed. Thornberry's letter was first reported by Sky News. It also emerged that Jeffrey Epstein paid for Lord Mandelson's travel on two separate occasions in 2003 totalling more than $7,400 (£5,400), according to documents released by the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee. Earlier this week, US lawmakers released an alleged \"birthday book\" containing messages sent to Jeffrey Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003 - including one from Lord Mandelson . In his letter, which features photos of the pair, Lord Mandelson described Jeffrey Epstein as his \"best pal\", and an \"intelligent, sharp-witted man\".

A further £142 million in UK aid will support Ukraine's energy infrastructure and vulnerable communities, while 100 new sanctions will aim to further hit Russia's economy and military supplies. Cooper was met by Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha at a railway station in Kyiv on Friday morning, and later met President Volodymyr Zelensky. Her visit, which the Foreign Office says reaffirms the UK's support for Ukraine, comes days after Russian drones violating Polish airspace were shot down by Poland and Nato. The Foreign Office said there had been \"a summer of Russian delay tactics at peace talks\" aimed at ending the conflict in the region, as well as increased attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Cooper added support for Kyiv was \"unwavering and stronger than ever\" and that fresh funding would support Ukraine through the winter and into 2026. She continued: \"Putin's bombardment of Ukrainian civilians, his stalling and delaying in internationally-backed peace talks, and his blatant disregard for human life must end.\" Of the funding boost, £100 million will be used to help civilians in frontline communities, including to repair critical water and heating systems, support livelihoods and strengthen resilience over the winter. The remaining £42 million will go towards carrying out vital repairs to Ukraine's electricity network and putting in place critical protection for gas and power infrastructure. Cooper will visit Kyiv's cabinet of ministers government building, which was hit for the first time on Sunday when Russia carried out its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the war began. She will also visit a residential building destroyed by a Russian strike. Separately, Prince Harry made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Friday after an invitation by an organisation that supports Ukrainians with life-changing injuries caused by the war. The Duke of Sussex, who arrived by train on Friday morning, said he wanted to do \"everything possible\" to help the recovery of injured military personnel. Reuters Prince Harry poses for a picture with wounded Ukrainian serviceman Vasyl, 38 As well as hitting economic and military targets, the Foreign Office said fresh sanctions on Russia will also hit 70 more ships involved in Putin's \"shadow fleet\" operation, responsible for illicitly carrying cargo including oil exports since the war began. Among the companies sanctioned are firms which supply Russia with equipment such as electronics, chemicals and explosives used to manufacture missiles and other weapons. Cooper said the measures \"form the next stage in the UK's leading efforts to ramp up economic pressure, alongside our security support and our work alongside the coalition of the willing for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine\". Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Theresa May is among the peers who are vehemently opposed to the legislation, arguing that it there were not enough safeguards to prevent people being pressured into ending their lives. The former Conservative PM spoke as the House of Lords began its scrutiny of the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which was passed by MPs with a majority of 23 in June. Responding outside the chamber, Leadbeater said terminally ill people supporting the Bill were \"definitely not suicidal\" but \"they are dying, and they have no choice about that\". Outside Parliament, demonstrators for and against the plans made their views known as the Bill progresses towards potentially coming into force in England and Wales. Inside, the red benches in the Lords were packed with a record number of requests to speak as two days of consideration began, with Leadbeater, who introduced the Bill to the Commons, watching from the gallery. Baroness May spoke in opposition, warning of the risk of medical cover-ups, and saying she had a friend who calls it the \"license to kill Bill\" as a result. She said in her view the legislation would be \"an assisted suicide Bill\", adding: \"Suicide is wrong, but this Bill, effectively, says suicide is okay. What message does that give to our society?\" The Bill did not have good enough safeguards to prevent people from being pressurised to end their lives, she said, and she also worried about knock-on effects around normalising deaths by suicide for people who feel their life is \"less worth living than others\". \"I worry about the impact it will have on people with disabilities, with chronic illness, with mental health problems, because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others,\" she said. Leadbeater praised Baroness May's \"very powerful contribution\" to the debate but said she found \"the framing around suicide very uncomfortable\". \"The terminally ill people I've met are definitely not suicidal,\" she told PA Media. \"They definitely don't want to die, but they are dying, and they have no choice about that.\" The MP for Spen Valley dismissed talk of potential medical cover-ups, saying the legislation aimed to put a \"very robust\" law in place to create \"a framework around the assisted death rather than the lack of framework that there is at the moment\". With peers speaking against the Bill outnumbering those in favour by about two-to-one on the first day of two days of debate, Leadbeater said she was still confident the Bill would ultimately be allowed by the Lords. \"I do remain confident that the will of the public will be respected, as will the will of the elected chamber,\" she said, referring to the House of Commons. During the debate, peers made emotional pleas on both sides of the assisted dying debate, many sharing personal tales of loss underpinning their stance. The former justice secretary Lord Charlie Falconer, who is the sponsor of the Bill in the Lords, branded the current legal situation \"confused\", causing \"terrible suffering\" and lacking \"compassion and safeguards\". Lord Falconer reassured peers there would be \"more than enough time\" for scrutiny before the current Parliamentary session ended next spring and that he was \"very open\" to suggestions for how the Bill could be \"further strengthened and improved\". However, he reminded his colleagues the Bill had already been passed by MPs and the House of Lords should \"respect the primacy of the Commons\", instead of trying to block the plans. \"We must do our job in this House, and our job is not to frustrate, it is to scrutinise,\" he said. As debate began, Conservative peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean told colleagues he had changed his mind on the issue after his father, who \"died in agony\" from cancer, said his son was to blame for not allowing him to end his suffering. \"I was completely poleaxed by that,\" he said, adding his father told him: \"you have consistently voted to prevent me getting what I want, which is having the opportunity to decide how and when I come to die\". \"As a Christian I have thought about that long and hard, and come to the conclusion that my father was right,\" he added. House of Cards trilogy author Lord Michael Dobbs described the current legal framework as \"cruel and untenable\" and insisted those who were opposed for religious reasons had \"no right to impose your view on others\". He said: \"I wish I'd had the opportunity out of love to help my mother pass peacefully in my arms, instead of watching her years of suffering. \"It would have been her choice, but she had no choice, and instead I'm left with an enduring memory of endless pain.\" Speaking in support, Baroness Margaret Hodge said \"denying choice represents a fundamental attack on the freedom and right of individuals to control their life at that terrible time when they're dying\". She said: \"In my view, we're presented with a straightforward choice: are we prepared to allow people in this country faced with certain and imminent death to choose how they die? \"I want that choice for myself, I would have wanted that choice for those close to me whom I have seen die in terrible agony.\" Speaking against, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson said certain aspects of the assisted dying Bill \"blur the line\" for doctors around euthanasia. Lady Grey-Thompson, a Paralympian and long-time campaigner on the rights of disabled people, said: \"Clause 25, sub-clause eight, allows the co-ordinating doctor to assist the person to ingest or otherwise self-administer the substance. This blurs the line between assisted dying and euthanasia.\" Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally has warned that the \"choice\" to die \"is an illusion\" without \"fully-funded palliative and social care services\". Dame Sarah told the Lords: \"Above all, this Bill fails in its central plank, that it delivers choice. \"A meaningful choice would see the measures in this Bill set alongside equally available, fully-funded palliative and social care services. \"Without the choice offered, this choice is an illusion.\" The House of Lords will continue its scrutiny of the Bill on Friday, 19 September.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy saw zero growth in the month, which was in line with expectations, following a 0.4% expansion in June. However, monthly figures are volatile, and the ONS has said it will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period. In the three months to July, the economy expanded by 0.2% The government is under mounting pressure to deliver on its key priority of boosting economic growth ahead of the Budget on 26 November. In the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans with increasing speculation she will raise taxes to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. The ONS said the service sector grew by 0.4% over the three months to July, helped by a good performance from the health sector, computer programming and office support services. However, this was offset by a fall in output from the production sector, which includes manufacturing. In July itself, manufacturing contracted by 1.3% - the sharpest monthly decline since July last year. The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, and then grew by 0.3% between April and June. The ONS said the latest figures showed the economy had \"continued to slow\" over the past three months. However, it is still on track to grow in the third quarter. What is GDP? When is the Budget and what might be in it? Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the UK's finances were \"looking pretty resilient to the barrage of shocks faced this year\". The latest data also comes ahead of the Bank of England's next interest rate decision on 18 September, with policymakers weighing up flagging growth against stubborn inflation. 'Sign of things to come' Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in the Budget if she wants to meet her self-imposed rules on the economy. These are: day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing by 2029-30 to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029-30 Estimates for the size of the \"black hole\" in the public finances that Reeves needs to fill in order to meet her rules vary widely, between £18bn and £50bn, but the chancellor has rejected the latter forecast . Since Labour pledged in its manifesto last year not to raise taxes on \"working people\" - namely income tax, National Insurance and VAT - speculation is growing around what changes she might make. Companies have long spoken of the financial hit they have taken from a rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and the minimum wage that came into force in April. And some have warned that tax rises for business could hamper growth further, with some saying they are holding off on hiring or investing until the details of the Budget become clear. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the \"weak start to the third quarter [is] a sign of things to come\". \"Economic activity is expected to slow in the second half of the year as the temporary factors which pushed up growth in the first half of 2025 begin to fade,\" she said. \"Additionally, the later date of the Autumn Budget could prolong some uncertainties for businesses, delaying investment decisions and acting as a drag on growth until more clarity emerges.\" Responding to the latest growth figures, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We know there's more to do to boost growth because whilst our economy isn't broken, it does feel stuck. \"That's the result of years of underinvestment, which we're determined to reverse through our plan for change. Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"Any economic growth is welcome - but this government is distracted from the problems the country is facing. \"While the government lurch from one scandal to another, borrowing costs recently hit a 27-year high - a damning vote of no confidence in Labour that makes painful tax rises all but certain.\" Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The government talks of going full throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. \"Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our High Streets and ministers' refusal to jettison their short-sighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.\" Personal finance GDP UK economy Related When is the Budget and what might be in it?

Left-wing backbencher Bell Riberio-Addy said she had not secured the 80 MP nominations needed by 17:00 BST on Thursday to progress. Phillipson, meanwhile, has secured 175 votes, while Powell has 117. In the next stage, the contenders have to win the backing of 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, such as a trade union, to go through to a ballot of members. 'Being deputy Labour leader is a ghastly job' Rayner's replacement will show which way political wind is blowing in Labour \"I want to unite our party and our movement, deliver the change our country needs and beat Reform,\" Phillipson said in a video posted on social media following Thursday evening's deadline. \"Now is the time to come together so we can unite to win again.\" Powell, meanwhile, has vowed to act as a \"bridge for all parts\" of the party. \"At a time when there are forces trying to spread division and hatred, Labour must be the voice of unity and hope,\" she said in a statement. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner, after she failed to pay enough tax on her £800,000 flat in Hove . The winner of the contest will not become deputy prime minister, as Rayner was, because that position has been handed to Justice Secretary David Lammy. Posting on social media after nominations closed on Thursday, Ribeiro-Addy said: \"Unfortunately, I have not secured the high number of nominations required to proceed in the deputy leadership contest. \"I am disappointed that the full range of Labour members' views will not be represented on the ballot paper.\" The position of deputy leader is a potentially powerful one, as a link between the Labour membership and the party leadership - and whoever wins will be at the forefront of Labour election campaigns. Crucially, they cannot be sacked by the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, as they will have their own mandate. Voting for the next deputy leader is likely to open for Labour members on 8 October and close on 23 October, with the winner being announced two days later. The remaining candidates will have an opportunity to woo Labour members at hustings during the party's conference in Liverpool at the end of September. The contest opens up chances for unhappy MPs and party members to express their discontent with the leadership, potentially overshadowing the big ministerial speeches. Phillipson - the only cabinet member left in the race - emerged as the early frontrunner after attracting support from MPs who are loyal to the government. But party members may prefer a candidate who is prepared to challenge Sir Keir, potentially harming Phillipson's chances. Powell - who was recently sacked from her cabinet role in a ministerial reshuffle - may attract the support of Labour MPs dissatisfied with the performance of Sir Keir's government and its policies. Many senior Labour figures have said the next leader should be a woman and from outside London to counter what they see as the London-centric and male-dominated party leadership.

Micheál Martin described the meeting, which took place on Friday at Chequers, as \"warm and constructive\". The Irish government, along with all of Northern Ireland's political parties and victims' groups, oppose the existing UK Legacy Act. In December, the Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn formally started the process to repeal the act. \"Very good progress has been made on legacy and the prime minister and I agreed that we are close to setting out a framework to address legacy issues, recognising its importance to victims and survivors, and to the wider community in Northern Ireland and across these islands,\" Martin told reporters following the meeting. When asked if the updated framework would be completed in a matter of weeks, he said: \"I am not going to put a time down on it but it'll be shortly.\" The Legacy Act was passed by the previous Conservative government in September 2023 despite widespread opposition to it. It created a new legacy body, the the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR), to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The act shut down all historical inquests. The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families. 'Need for a ceasefire' The situation in Gaza and the war between Russia and Ukraine were also mentioned at the meeting. \"We discussed the catastrophic situation in Gaza - the need for a ceasefire, release of all hostages and a massive surge in humanitarian aid,\" Martin said. \"We also committed to continue working together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.\" Their meeting comes after the tánaiste (Irish deputy minister) previously told a crowd in Oxford that the new agreement on dealing with legacy cases was \"effectively there\".

The former environment secretary inherited the housing brief from Angela Rayner in last week's reshuffle, after she resigned over her tax affairs . Reed told the BBC the only way out of what he called a housing \"crisis\" was to \"build baby build\" and threatened sanctions on developers who dragged their feet, although he did not specify what that might entail. Industry leaders have warned the government faces a \"huge challenge\" to reach its target, with housebuilders facing \"mounting pressures\". The Conservatives said the government's housing pledges \"are for the birds\". \"Everyone knows Labour can't deliver on their housing promises,\" shadow housing secretary James Cleverly said. \"New housing relies on backing builders. But from day one this government has been anti-business and anti-growth.\" The promise to build 1.5 million new homes over the next Parliament - which is due to run until 2029 - was a key pledge in Labour's general election manifesto. BBC Verify's Housing Tracker recently showed the number of new homes in England fell during Labour's first year in power, continuing a fall that began under the Conservatives. However, applications to build more homes have risen over the past six months. Legislation aimed at reforming the planning system to speed up housebuilding is currently going through Parliament. UK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes? Labour's plan to build 1.5m homes – can it be delivered? Pressed over whether the 1.5 million pledge was a hope or a guarantee, Reed told the BBC: \"It's what we're going to do. \"We'll do it by working in partnership with the developers and with the builders,\" he said. \"My job is to get every barrier out of the way that is stopping that construction going ahead.\" Speaking during a visit to a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire, Reed said he was going to come up with an \"acceleration package\" that would get planning applications approved more quickly and \"spades in the ground\". He added: \"I don't want the developers dragging their feet. They don't want to drag their feet - it's their business. \"They make money from going ahead with construction. I'm going to work in partnership with the developers but there will be sanctions if the building doesn't go ahead at pace and at scale.\" This week the Home Builders Federation warned the sector was facing rising regulatory costs and taxes , \"compounded by delays in processing planning applications\". In Bedfordshire, Garry Dixon, who runs a construction company that works on smaller residential developments, said rising costs were a \"massive\" challenge. \"I would say three years ago you were getting bricks at 75p, 80p a brick and now they're like £1.20 a brick,\" he said. \"It's just huge, and that's just one sector of the build.\" He said the government should put more money into training and apprenticeships to ensure the sector had the skills it needed, but that was not a \"quick fix\". Steve Reed was speaking to the BBC at a housing development near Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire Reed was also challenged over whether the government's pledge to stop housing asylum seekers in hotels by the end of the Parliament could increase pressure on housing. The promise has prompted concern that asylum seekers could be moved into houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) - rental homes for groups of people sharing facilities. Reed told the BBC: \"We're looking at a number of options. We intend to do this in a way that does not put further pressure on the housing market. \"People are already struggling to find a place to live, to rent or to buy. We don't want to add to that burden so we will find a solution to that.\" The government has already said it is looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers , as well as considering using prefabricated buildings or warehouses. Reed was moved from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government after Rayner resigned over failing to pay enough tax on a flat purchase. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Reed said he was \"very close\" to Rayner and her resignation was \"very painful\". \"Angela's a friend who was going through a very, very difficult time. And you know on the one level, I wanted to reach out to her and support her as a friend and I did that,\" he said. \"But on another level, there are these events that I'm watching on the TV news at the same time. And it's quite odd when you suddenly find yourself and the things that are happening to the people around you in the news too.\" You can listen to Steve Reed's full interview on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson on BBC Sounds .

The move by Manchester Metropolitan University comes after Mandelson was sacked as UK ambassador to the USA by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Thursday. He was dismissed after it was revealed that he sent Epstein supportive messages while the disgraced American financier was facing sex offences charges. A spokesman for the university - of which Mandelson was chancellor between 2016 and 2024 - said his honorary awards have been rescinded \"following the revelations that have come to light in recent days\". He had been given honorary doctorate on his appointment as chancellor, and a commemorative medal at the end of his tenure. Mandelson's links to Epstein had been discussed by the university's board of governors during his tenure, when a photograph of the two was made public. \"At that time we were reassured that there was no ongoing connection nor anything that would compromise Lord Mandelson's position,\" the university spokesman said. He added: \"Our thoughts are with the victims who were subjected to the appalling crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and to all those who continue to be affected today. \"The University no longer has any ties with Lord Mandelson.\" Mandelson, one of the principal architects of New Labour, was appointed as ambassador to the USA in December 2024. Epstein died of suicide in the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in New York City on 10 August 2019, while awaiting trial.

Prices are rising, jobs growth has stalled, uncertainty is everywhere and stock markets have soared to record highs. Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being uttered again: stagflation. GDP chart Stagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with “inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession. US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers Read more The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending. For now, the US economy isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it. After Donald Trump ’s tariffs were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021. However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were revised down by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year. Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate hit 2.9%, the highest since January. Inflation chart Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing. “Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.” In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation. Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation. Trump’s crackdown on immigration has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to prices , tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers. Investors are banking on hopes the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain. In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, outlined the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer. US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported Read more “While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.” Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. Inflation went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August. The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy. Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty. “Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.” One analysis from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue. If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger. jobs chart “If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said. The Yale Budget Lab estimated that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”. The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has claimed that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president. “The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.” Explore more on these topics US economy Trump tariffs Inflation Economics Donald Trump Trump administration US politics analysis Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.355 against the US dollar this morning. The pound against the US dollar over the last 24 hours (timings in GMT) Photograph: LSEG Kathleen Brooks , research director at XTB, points out there is “not much to like” from the July monthly GDP update, with zero growth in the economy at the start of the third quarter. If the third quarter is not going to be a disaster for the UK economy, then growth in August and September will need to do the heavy lifting. The pound is extending losses on this news and is eroding some of Thursday’s gains. For now, GBP/USD is hanging on to $1.3550, however, if bond yields start to rise on the back of this data, then we could see pound weakness later on Friday. The pound is the third worst performer in the G10 FX space so far today.

The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget. It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half. The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing. The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.” More here: UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves Read more In other news Ocado’s shares have plunged 20% after its US partner, grocery giant Kroger, signalled a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses.

The London stock market has just closed, cementing a terrible day for Ocado. Ocado’s shares have ended the day down 19.9%, at 240p, as City investors react to the news that its US partner Kroger was considering a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses. That knocks £500m off Ocado’s market value, as the company was worth just over £2.5bn at the start of the day. Chris Beauchamp , chief market analyst at IG , says: “It is hard to overstate how damaging this news is for Ocado. Kroger was one of the linchpins of its expansion strategy, and was a poster boy for the use of Ocado’s technology worldwide. Others may now follow suit. Sadly Ocado has been a losing proposition for most investors over the course of its life as a listed company, with only a brief period in 2013/14 and then from 2018-2021 really delivering the goods.

The University of Michican’s index of consumer morale has declined to 55.4 from 58.2 in August; according to Bloomberg that’s the lowest reading since May. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu reports that sentiment about the economy fell particularly strongly among lower and middle income consumers, adding: Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well; current and expected personal finances both eased about 8% this month. Trade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month. Still, sentiment remains above April and May 2025 readings, immediately after the initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs.

As flagged earlier, Ocado’s shares are under pressure after key customer Kroger , the US grocery giant, said it would undertake a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. That has raised fears of weaker demand for its robotic warehouses. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell , comments: Kroger also said it was using stores ‘very heavily’ to fulfil e-commerce orders and implied that was its key focus from now on. “These comments imply that Ocado might find it harder to sell more automated solutions to Kroger, and that existing agreements might come under review. It’s the worst kind of news imaginable for Ocado investors as they’ve bought into a company which has positioned itself as the technology solution to grocery providers’ needs. While Ocado has continued to win new contracts, the pace has been erratic. The prospect of existing relationships starting to deteriorate adds another level of risk. Then there is the big question of when Ocado will ever make a sustainable profit.” Share 3d ago 09.47 EDT There’s a quiet start to trading on Wall Street, a day after stocks hit record levels. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 126 points, or 0.27%, to 45,982 points.

Following this morning’s news that GDP was unchanged in July, NIESR estimate that UK GDP will rise by 0.4% in the July-September quarter. That would be slightly faster growth than the 0.3% recorded in the second quarter of this year. NIESR says: We expect GDP to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, as we forecast better monthly growth outturns for August and September. However, elevated uncertainty among businesses and households continue to pose downside risks to this forecast. Fergus Jimenez-England , associate economist at NIESR , warns that economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments, adding: “Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the Chancellor this Autumn.” ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker expect #UKGDP to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter 📈 ⬇️Read more here 📊⬇️ #UKeconomy #gdpgrowth https://t.co/U504vvjFVF &mdash; National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) September 12, 2025 \\n\\n\"}}\"> ⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker expect #UKGDP to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter 📈 ⬇️Read more here 📊⬇️ #UKeconomy #gdpgrowth https://t.co/U504vvjFVF — National Institute of Economic and Social Research (@NIESRorg) September 12, 2025 Share 3d ago 07.54 EDT Ocado shares fall 12% on Kroger worries Back in the financial markets, shares in Ocado have slumped by 12% on fears that one of its key customers could be pulling back from automation. Online grocery firm Ocado is the top faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after US supermarket chain Kroger said it plans to conduct a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. This suggests Ocado might struggle to sell more automated solutions to Kroger , who has been an important customer in the past. Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets , explains: Last night on its earnings call, the US retailer, which is Ocado’s biggest partner for its warehouse automation technology, said it would take a “hard look” at some of its automated facilities and carry out a “full site-by-site analysis” of its existing network. The comments are clearly a negative for Ocado as Kroger seems likely to move away from the kind of large CFCs provided by the British company and instead seems to be looking to lean on local stores to fill orders. Back in 2018, Ocado’s shares soared after it announced a deal to provide its technology to Kroger – a breakthrough in its push to licence its services to grocers around the world.

He argued: “We need to curb expenditure at the government level. We need to find a way to curb wage inflation.” Barclays boss urges UK ministers to limit public sector pay rises Read more TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has said in responcse that “the prize for the most tone-deaf comment of the year goes to C. S. Venkatakrishnan”, adding: “This banking boss has some brass neck.

The Bank of Russia has decided to cut its key lending rate by 100 basis points to 17.00%, down from 18%. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a cut of 200 basis points. Announcing the decision, the Bank points out that inflation is still running above its 4% target: Underlying measures of current price growth have not changed significantly and generally remain above 4% in annualised terms. The economy continues to return to a balanced growth path. Lending growth has accelerated in recent months. Inflation expectations remain high.

It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half. The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing. CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Read more The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.” a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile. The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further. “Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.” The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London. Business groups have blamed Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution , which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business. Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade. “The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence. Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. “Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.” Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed. The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which jumped to 3.8% in July , prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months. The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday. Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/Reuters Economic growth (GDP) Analysis Stagnant GDP shows scale of challenge for Rachel Reeves at autumn budget Richard Partington Senior economics correspondent Chancellor calls economy ‘stuck, not broken’ but there are signs her policies have added to the UK’s economic headwinds Business live – latest updates UK economy flatlines in July Business rates rise putst big shops at risk, say retailers Fri 12 Sep 2025 04.54 EDT Last modified on Fri 12 Sep 2025 05.05 EDT Share “Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from Rachel Reeves . Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job. The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. Growth flatlined in July , slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer. Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year. Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July. CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Read more Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers. Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025 women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services. The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds. Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment. As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances. Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging.

Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power. On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the International Monetary Fund – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges. Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.

This latest sign of a weakening jobs market has pushed shares higher on Wall Street, as investors anticipate cuts to US interest rates. That’s despite US inflation rising in August, with the consumer prices up by 2.9% over the last year , up from 2.7% in July. Rising food and housing costs were a factor, while economists warned that companies were passing on the cost of tariffs to consumers.

In the UK, the owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges. John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology. As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.

Rather than worrying about the state of the labor market, traders seem to be betting that the US Federal Reserve is on track to cut interest rates next week. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 218 points, or 0.5%, in early trading to 45,708 points. The broader S&P 500 index is 0.25% higher. Analysts at ING agree that the Fed’s focus is now the jobs market. James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist, explains: Inflation was a touch higher than expected and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated over coming months, but the the weakening of the jobs market is now the Fed’s priority, with rising jobless claims hinting at a pick-up in lay-offs at a time when hiring is subdued Share 4d ago 09.27 EDT Curiously, much of the increase in US jobless claims last week was recorded in Texas. The number of initial claims (a proxy for layoffs) in Texas almost doubled in the week to 6 September, to 31,908 from 16,604 in the previous seven days. There was also an increase of 2,980 in Michigan, but many other states recorded a drop in claims (before seasonal adjustments). Bloomberg economist Eliza Winger says: The surge in initial jobless claims in the first week of September came primarily from Texas, while claims declined in most states. While any deterioration in the labor market bears watching given growing labor-market weakness, a broader increase in claims would have been much more concerning.” Share 4d ago 09.18 EDT Experts: Fed likely to cut rates to help weak jobs market The jump in US jobless claims last week, and the pick-up in inflation in August, are a worrying sign for America’s economy. Together, they paint a picture of an economy losing jobs, as consumers are hit by rising prices in the shops, as tariffs are passed onto consumers. Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank, explains: “The August CPI inflation report was a hot one, no matter how you slice or dice it. President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now. “Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6 th September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021. This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.” Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying: While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years. This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view. Share 4d ago 09.10 EDT New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high Ouch! The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has hit its highest level in almost four years. The number of ‘initial claims’ for unemployment benefits jumped by 27,000 last week to 263,000, the highest level for initial claims since October 23, 2021. That will reinforce concerns that the US labor market has weakened, following recent weak non-farm payroll reports, and Tuesday’s news that the US added 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated for the year to March . Aaron Hill , chief market analyst at FP Markets, says the jobs slowdown will fan speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, adding:​ The central bank faces mounting pressure, but its room to manoeuvre is razor-thin. Share 4d ago 08.54 EDT Companies 'passing rising costs from tariffs onto consumers' US inflation “continued its march higher” in August, reports Katy Stoves , investment manager at Mattioli Woods . Stoves says US companies are now passing the cost of tariffs onto customers: With buffer inventories that had been built ahead of tariffs being depleted, businesses are now forced to replenish stock at elevated prices. With the tariffs looking to be more permanent, companies now have cover to pass these rising costs onto consumers, rather than compressing margins. Whilst some had anticipated tariffs would create a one-off price adjustment, the data increasingly suggests this may be a more prolonged process with peak effects still to come. Share 4d ago 08.52 EDT The prices of all six major American grocery store food groups rose in August, today’s US inflation report shows. The index for fruits and vegetables rose 1.6% over the month, as tomato prices jumped by 4.5% and apple prices increased by 3.5%. The meats, poultry, fish and eggs index increased by 1.0% in August with the beef index up by 2.7%. On an annual basis, meats, poultry, fish, and eggs were 5.6% more expensive than a year ago. The index for nonalcoholic beverages increased by 0.6% during August and the index for other food at home increased 0.1%. Dairy and related products index and cereals and bakery products both rose by 0.1%. Share 4d ago 08.43 EDT Tariffs 'clearly hitting' as US inflation rises On a monthly basis, the US inflation report shows prices rose by 0.4% in August alone. That’s twice as fast as the 0.2% rise in prices recorded in July. The BLS reports that housing (shelter) and food were key drivers: The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in August and was the largest factor in the all items monthly increase.

Turkey’s central bank has lowered its policy interest rate by 250 basis points to 40.5%, a slightly bigger cut than expected. It eased policy after inflation slowed to 32.95% in August 2025 from 33.52% in July. The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye explained: The underlying trend of inflation slowed down in August. While GDP growth was above projections in the second quarter, final domestic demand remained weak. Recent data indicate that demand conditions are at disinflationary levels. Food prices and service items with high inertia are exerting upward pressure on inflation. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, and global developments continue to pose risks to the disinflation process. The tight monetary policy stance, which will be maintained until price stability is achieved, will strengthen the disinflation process through demand, exchange rate, and expectation channels.

Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images US economy US inflation rises in August as firms pass Trump tariffs cost on to consumers New CPI update shows prices increased 2.9% over the last year, but Wall Street optimistic Fed will cut interest rates Lauren Aratani in New York Thu 11 Sep 2025 08.42 EDT Last modified on Thu 11 Sep 2025 11.41 EDT Share Inflation rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of tariffs on to consumers. The newest update to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July. Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the US jobs market is weakening . Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%. US stocks shot up on Wednesday after the producer price index, which tracks wholesale prices, showed a slight dip in August after a steep rise in July, making investors hopeful that inflation – while still rising – is going up at a slow pace. latest inflation chart The Fed has refrained from cutting rates over the past year, citing instability in the economy introduced by federal immigration and trade policies. The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market. At his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, Jerome Powell , said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates. Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”. “If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said. Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection. Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy went into the negative for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021. The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.

Photograph: ABF Grocery inflation stood at 5% in August, according to the latest data from analysts Worldpanel, contributing to wider inflation, which rose to 3.8% in July. He added that Primark had not raised clothing prices in a year as it had been able to offset higher labour costs with more technology, such as self-service tills and lower freight and cotton prices. Weston said given the higher food prices, Primark’s shoppers had kept a tighter rein on spending than more affluent consumers. “We had to work very hard to earn our shoppers’ money, as we are not in an easy consumer environment,” he said, with sales in the UK and Ireland rising by 1% over the six months to 13 September, helped by new store openings. But shares in ABF slid more than 13% on Wednesday as analysts said trading at Primark’s mainland Europe outlets had been worse than hoped. The company also warned that sugar profits would be below expectations. ABF’s sugar business, which includes the closing Vivergo ethanol plant , is also likely to make a £40m loss, much deeper than feared. The company said group sales are expected to have fallen by 2% at established Primark stores in the six months to 13 September, with sales flat at established UK stores and sales falls in Germany, France and Italy. Weston blamed “political turmoil” in France, which was the worst performing country, and consumer uncertainty elsewhere in Europe amid the Ukraine war and inflation. Weston said Primark was “trading very strongly” as a seasonal change in the weather had led to demand for warmer clothing and it had sharpened up its fashion ranges, particularly on denim. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many retailers fear Reeves will impose further tax increases on businesses in her 26 November budget. Weston said: “I hope consumer sentiment doesn’t take another great whack in November … anything that reduces returns on investment or increases the costs of employing people [could affect sentiment]”. Weston said he would like to see Reeves’ November budget “closing that big loophole around de minimis” – a tax break that allows Shein and others to import items worth less than £135 direct to consumers without paying customs duty. “I don’t like to be faced with competition that has an unfair advantage which could be costing the Treasury maybe £100m a year,” he said. “A lot of money is being left on the table unnecessarily.” He also called on the chancellor to revise plans to increase business rates for large high street stores.

Pensions minister Torsten Bell and Starmer’s new chief economic adviser, Minouche Shafik , will co-chair the “budget board”, that will meet weekly to discuss the details of the statement. Government sources said the meetings were aimed at ensuring No 10 and No 11 were aligned and that there was not a repeat of the backlash from businesses that followed Rachel Reeves’s maiden budget. Starmer has looked to increase his grip on economic policy in recent weeks, by appointing Shafiq, poaching Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones, and appointing a longtime Treasury civil servant to be his principal private secretary. Reeves and her team were blamed for a series of political missteps last year, including slashing the winter fuel allowance, while business lobby groups have blamed her £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) for raising the cost of hiring and forcing them to push up prices. With the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) widely expected to downgrade its forecasts, the chancellor is expected to have to find significant tax increases in November, to avoid busting her fiscal rules in five years’ time. Bell, the former director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, has previously suggested a series of radical tax policies, including on inheritance tax, pensions and national insurance. But government officials confirmed the panel would also include Reeves’s chief of staff, Katie Martin, who recently took on the job of liaising with businesses on Reeves’s behalf, and Varun Chandra, who canvasses firms for No 10. The trio are expected to bring a business perspective to the discussions, which is likely to inject a note of caution around more radical policies. Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was seen by some in government as one of the driving forces behind the botched welfare reforms at the spring statement, will also attend. The prime minister’s new chief secretary, Darren Jones – previously a Treasury minister – and the communications directors from both No 10 and No 11, will sit on the board, too, officials confirmed. Also on the board will be Starmer’s new communications chief, Tim Allan , a veteran of Tony Blair’s time in government, with the former prime minister once describing him as “even more right wing than me”. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Vistry Group Housebuilder Vistry’s profits more than halve amid economic uncertainty Fall to £40.9m in first six months of year pushes share price down, with order book lower than year ago Mark Sweney and Julia Kollewe Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.27 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 07.45 EDT Share Half-year profits at Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, have more than halved as buyer demand comes under pressure from concerns over the economy, affordability struggles and slower-than-hoped interest rate cuts . The company, which owns Bovis Homes, Countryside and Linden Homes, said its pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell by 55% to £40.9m. The slump in profits, which on an adjusted basis fell by a third to £80.6m, pushed the housebuilder’s share price down as much as 8% in early trading, before recovering to 4% down on Wednesday. Vistry completed 6,889 homes, down by 12% from the 7,792 completed a year earlier. Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn. “While we reported some positive momentum in the first quarter, market conditions softened somewhat in the second quarter, reflecting increased macro concerns and ongoing affordability challenges, particularly for first-time buyers, with expected interest rate cuts being pushed further out,” the builder said. Vistry said its forward order book was lower than a year ago, standing at £4.3bn against £5.1bn this time last year. It added that it was looking to boost flagging demand with sales and marketing initiatives. It is offering private buyers discounts of up to 5% on the sale price. “We are looking to drive an improvement in our open market sales rate in the second half through our sales and marketing initiatives albeit we remain mindful that demand will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic uncertainties,” it said. Prices rose by 3% for private open market sales in the first half to £389,000 on average but it said sales rates were flat. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4% in August but economists are expecting further reductions to come at a far slower pace amid stubbornly high inflation. However, Vistry was upbeat, saying it remained on track to meet full-year expectations. The company formed a long-term joint venture with the UK’s housing agency , Homes England, earlier this week. The new vehicle, Hestia, is backed by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government pledged to build 1.5m homes over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vistry has shifted towards building social and affordable homes for its partners; it pre-sells at least 50% of new homes on its developments to housing associations, local authorities and private rented sector providers. Anthony Codling, a housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: “[Private rented sector] investors continue to drive a hard bargain, leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding; so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way. “We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders.” Explore more on these topics Vistry Group Construction industry Housing market Real estate Interest rates Economics news Share Reuse this content More on this story More on this story Seven UK housebuilders to pay £100m to fund affordable homes after CMA investigation 9 Jul 2025 UK construction activity contracts for fourth straight month as costs rise 7 May 2025 UK housebuilders ‘very bad’ at building houses, says wildlife charity CEO 1 Apr 2025 In the rush to build houses, let’s remember what communities need 17 Mar 2025 Housebuilder Vistry pins hopes on £2bn affordable homes promise as profits fall 26 Mar 2025 Recruitment report reveals rise in UK demand for construction workers 17 Mar 2025 UK housebuilder Vistry’s shares plunge as it issues third profit warning 24 Dec 2024 From backwater to hotspot: how HS2 could bring £10bn economic boost to Old Oak Common 2 Mar 2025 Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Confederation of British Industry (CBI) CBI boss calls for Reeves to tear up Labour’s pledge not to raise tax Rain Newton-Smith tells chancellor ‘the time for tinkering is over’ and revisit promise not to raise taxes on working people CBI chief: ‘It’s time for Reeves to reconsider Labour’s manifesto promises on tax’ Heather Stewart and Richard Partington Tue 9 Sep 2025 12.04 EDT Last modified on Wed 10 Sep 2025 06.17 EDT Share The boss of the Confederation of British Industry has suggested the chancellor should tear up Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people, in a significant intervention before the budget. Rachel Reeves is widely expected to present a package of tax rises in her 26 November statement to offset deteriorating economic forecasts. However, the chancellor has been hamstrung by Labour’s promise not to increase the three main revenue-raisers for the Treasury: income tax, national insurance and VAT. In a surprise move in the debate about how to raise extra revenue, the CBI’s chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, says the “time for tinkering is over”. Writing in the Guardian, the head of the longstanding lobby group representing many of the UK’s largest companies warns the chancellor against “slavish adherence” to tax promises made in the run-up to last year’s general election. She said the pre-election promises have now been overtaken by events. “The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions,” she writes. “The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago.” The party’s manifesto states : “Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.” As well as suggesting Reeves revisit Labour’s promises on personal taxation, Newton-Smith calls for the reform of business rates, VAT thresholds for small firms and stamp duty. Reeves used her maiden budget last October to announce a £40bn package of tax increases , including a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions that was widely criticised by businesses and has been blamed for helping fuel inflation. The chancellor subsequently promised not to return with further tax rises, saying “there’s no need to come back with another budget like this” and “we’ll never need to do that again.” However, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility is widely expected to downgrade its growth forecasts, after a review of its optimistic-looking expectations for productivity. This shift, coming after costly U-turns on welfare reform and the winter fuel allowance, could leave the Treasury looking for £20bn-£30bn in revenue in five years’ time to put Reeves on course to meet her fiscal rules. Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, agreed with Newton Smith that finding £20bn or more within the constraints of the manifesto would be problematic. “Raising that amount without touching taxes that account for three-quarters of the UK’s tax base risks distorting behaviour, loading excessive pain on to small groups, and harming economic growth,” she said. “Manifesto pledges are important, but there’s a point at which they cause more harm than they’re worth.” Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her determination to stick to the pledges in recent weeks, however, as speculation has mounted about potential tax rises. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are protecting payslips for working people by keeping our promise not to raise the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance, or VAT.” As well as calling for tax changes, Newton-Smith also reiterates the CBI’s concerns about the government’s employment rights legislation, which she argues is deterring firms from hiring. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The bill includes immediate protection from unfair dismissal, after a yet-to-be determined probationary period, the right to regular hours, and the right for unions to access workplaces. Union leaders gathering in Brighton for the TUC conference on Tuesday said Labour had sought to issue reassurances that the party was still committed to the landmark bill. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, who is standing in the contest to succeed Rayner as deputy Labour leader, told delegates on Tuesday: “One year ago we were elected to deliver this employment rights bill, and congress that is what we will do. We will not accept any watering down by the Lords. Forward with the employment rights bill in full. No ifs, no buts.” One union leader said ministers risked blowing up relations with the labour movement at a difficult moment for the government, and would need to retain its workers’ rights plan to show a key point of difference with Nigel Farage’s Reform. “They are not going to want to go to party conference fighting with us,” the leader argued. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said the government reshuffle had created “anxiety” at the Brighton conference, but that he believed Labour would push ahead with a policy that sought to bridge business and union demands. “We need to take business with us on this journey, the re-regulation of the labour market is necessary and not up for debate, but, you know, we know what it’s like to have been on the wrong end of getting things done to us for 14 years.” Keir Starmer carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle in the wake of Rayner’s departure, partly aimed at bolstering the government’s growth agenda. At Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, the prime minister told colleagues they should be ready to “move from fixing the foundations to driving forward the growth and national renewal that delivers for working people”, according to a readout from his official spokesperson.

Photograph: WPA/Getty Images Budget 2025 It’s time for Rachel Reeves to reconsider Labour’s manifesto promises on tax Rain Newton-Smith The budget must reform structures such as business rates, the VAT threshhold and stamp duty that are holding back growth CBI boss calls for Labour to tear up its manifesto prmoises Tue 9 Sep 2025 11.58 EDT Last modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 21.30 EDT Share T his government came to power after years of instability, pitching competence and commitment to the long term and without doubt, business wants them to succeed. So for the reshuffle to be more than political theatre, it needs to regalvanise the growth mission. That means making it easier for business to invest, create jobs and drive higher living standards. Leadership calls not only for promises, but vision and delivery. There are no easy choices, either on policy or personnel. And as we look ahead to the chancellor’s budget in November, she must recognise that that we must avoid short-term solutions that risk us getting stuck in a cycle between fiscal events. The government must grasp the nettle and find the right solutions to the big challenges on tax and regulation. This decisive action can then be matched by business investment to get our economy back on the rise and deliver improved living standards for people in every region. The prime minister said we cannot tax our way to growth and that is certainly true. Businesses already pay more tax than ever before. The £308bn paid last year more than covers the budgets of the NHS, schools and defence combined. Businesses are also picking up a greater proportion of the tax bill: paying 30% of all tax in 2023-24, the highest proportion since 1998, rising to 32% from this year as they pay an extra £24bn in NICs. Alongside this burden, business regulation is growing. The employment rights bill in its current form will add cost and complexity, is already leading some firms to put hiring plans on ice, and risks making it even harder to bring people back into work. There is still a chance to achieve the bill’s aims without frustrating those shared goals, but government must seize it now. Sectors critical for job creation in local communities often have low margins and high fixed costs so feel cumulative tax rises and the burden of unwieldy regulation more sharply. And most of the taxes they pay – including VAT, business rates and NICs – are due whether they make a profit or not. A further tax rise for enterprise would not only be unwise but would run contrary to the promises of autumn 2024, when businesses last stomached a tax hit. Further rises would leave us with a growth plan in name only. Profit is not a dirty word – it’s the reward for taking risks, it funds investment, creates jobs, and powers pay rises. Businesses that cannot sustain themselves also cannot sustain the jobs that rely on them – let alone invest and grow. The fact is that geopolitics and global markets have shifted. The world is different from when Labour drafted its manifesto, and when the facts change so should the solutions. The chancellor cannot raid corporate coffers again so she must look elsewhere, embracing long-term strategic tax reforms rather than maintaining a slavish adherence to manifesto promises on tax or ideas based on the world as it was 18 months ago. The chancellor must commit to tax reform, not just tax rises. It is the structure of the system, not just the rates, that holds back growth: business rates penalise investment; the VAT threshold discourages scaling; and stamp duty restricts labour mobility. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How do we help small businesses burst through the VAT ceiling? Can we fix tax thresholds and childcare so it always pays to work harder? How do we ensure tax doesn’t stop people moving? Could road pricing fill the yawning gap government faces as fuel duties decline? Many plausible answers have been in the “good idea but too difficult” box for too long. Now is the time to fix things we know have long been broken. (You can add not backing away from driving efficiency in public services to that list of hard but necessary reforms too.) While it’s imperative to understand the challenges we face, that does not equate to talking down our economy. There are deep roots of greatness and potential in the UK: our universities are world-beating, our life sciences sector is a global leader, and our financial services are a powerhouse industry. We have everything we need to steal a march on our competitors, but only if we act fast and decisively now. The time for tinkering is over. We need to see commitment to the vision, reform and delivery, delivery, delivery of the government’s chief economic aim, growth. That means along with changes of personnel, changing outdated tax policies that risk hobbling our national ambition. The writer is the chief executive of the CBI business lobby group.

Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters US unemployment and employment data US created 911,000 fewer jobs through March 2025 than initially reported Revision highlights recent concerns about the health of the labor market, and follows a lackluster August jobs report Michael Sainato Tue 9 Sep 2025 11.09 EDT Last modified on Sat 13 Sep 2025 18.30 EDT Share The US added 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated for the year to March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announced on Tuesday, highlighting recent concerns about the health of the labor market. The revisions are 50% higher than last year’s adjustment and were on the higher end of Wall Street estimates between 600,000 and 1 million. The revision comes after a lackluster August jobs report , with only 22,000 jobs added in the US. That report too contained revisions and noted that 13,000 jobs were lost for the month of June 2025, the first negative jobs report survey since December 2020. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, the highest rate since 2021. Donald Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, after a weak July job’s report that he claimed – without evidence – was “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. But while these revisions to the jobs data are large, they are not unusual. During periods of economic change – such as the introduction of tariffs and the arrival of AI in the workplace – economists note businesses often take longer to reply to the BLS’s surveys, leading to gaps in their data. US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing slowdown amid Trump tariffs Read more “Annual revisions incorporate slow, administrative (non-survey) data that helps keep monthly estimates representative of broad labor-market trends,” stated Friends of Bureau of Labor Statistics in an FAQ on job statistics from the bureau . The largest revisions were in leisure and hospitality (down 176,000), professional and business services (down 158,000) and retail trade (down 126,200). Government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000 jobs. The numbers released will face further revisions when BLS releases final benchmark figure in February 2026. “These numbers are likely to anger President Trump and the White House who incorrectly view revised data as political manipulation,” wrote Elise Gould and Ben Zipperer, economists at the Economic Policy Institute, in a post on the report. “Trump has already lashed out at BLS, including firing the agency’s commissioner because a jobs report showed a rapidly weakening labor market. But these BLS data revisions are not corrections of mistakes. Revisions are part of the regular, transparent process to update employment counts with the most comprehensive data possible.” Explore more on these topics US unemployment and employment data US economy Economics Donald Trump news Share Reuse this content Most viewed Most viewed Business Economics Diversity & equality in business Small business Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle Original reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning Sign up for our email About us Help Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Contact us All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Tax strategy Facebook YouTube Instagram LinkedIn Newsletters Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Tips Accessibility settings Back to top © 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Retail industry UK retail sales rise but stores fear tax worries could hit festive period Warm weather and interest rate cut lift sales in August, as food, drink and computers perform strongly Mark Sweney Tue 9 Sep 2025 01.00 EDT Last modified on Tue 9 Sep 2025 02.38 EDT Share Record warm weather and a Bank of England interest rate cut lifted retail sales in August, according to the latest survey, but retailers fear that speculation about tax rises could weigh on consumers in the crucial pre-Christmas trading period. Retail sales increased 3.1% year on year as consumer spending on food and drink rose, and sales of computers and related equipment performed well as parents readied children for the new school year. However, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which publishes the monthly figures in conjunction with KPMG, said the 4.7% boost in spending on food and drink was due to price rises as opposed to consumers buying more products. The report said food inflation was driven by rising prices across staples including beef, chocolate and coffee. And while computing – and gaming – continued to show strong sales, parents facing an expensive start to the new school year cut back on buying uniforms. The BRC said businesses were concerned about sales in the golden quarter, the crucial three-month period in the run-up to Christmas that many retailers rely on for the bulk of their revenues. “Sunny weather and an interest rate cut helped August round off a solid summer of sales,” said the chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Despite a better summer, retailers approach the golden quarter with caution. “With the later-than-expected budget falling just days before Black Friday [discount sales], many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas.” Last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the budget would be held on 26 November , later than many had expected. Last month’s sales increase followed a rise of 2.5% in July, fuelled by warm weather and England’s successful Euros football campaign , and 3.1% in June. The latest report also found furniture sales grew for the second month in a row, after months of decline, as did home goods such as appliances, DIY products and garden tools. Linda Ellett, the head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: “Sales of many home goods have been seeing monthly increases since the spike in property transactions ahead of the changes to stamp duty in April. “Home appliances, accessories and DIY and garden tools all saw sales growth in August. New product launches also boosted mobile phone sales.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall non-food sales increased by 1.8% year on year last month, the third consecutive monthly increase. However, the report also found that shopper confidence fell for the third consecutive month in August, with many expecting further food price inflation and other financial pressures. Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said: “The emotional weight of rising energy bills and fears of tax hikes in the autumn budget are adding to the strain, especially as unemployment ticks upward “Yet there are glimmers of relief: interest rates have been cut again, and mortgage rates are easing, offering some financial respite.

David O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, is meeting US counterparts on Monday, as Europe and the US look for tougher measures to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine after Russia launched its largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend. Ahead of those meetings, the head of the European Council, António Costa, hailed transatlantic cooperation over sanctions against Russia and said it was clear that the US remained engaged in supporting Ukraine. Trump says he is ready to impose new sanctions on Russia. What might happen now? Read more A European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that its president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, over the phone on Friday, and “the only topic during the call was Ukraine”. Asked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions against Russia , Trump responded: “Yeah I am,”without elaborating. Trump also said that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and that he would speak to the Russian president soon. Trump has previously threatened tougher measures against Putin, but each time has allowed deadlines to pass without action. Speaking in Helsinki on Monday, Costa said the EU and US were “coordinating our efforts to align our sanctions, to be more effective” and to increase pressure on Putin to join peace negotiations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said the EU needed to increase sanctions on Russia, “but also secondary sanctions” on countries buying gas and oil from Russia. A bar graph showing the number of daily missile and drone strikes in Ukraine The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, “which show further escalation”, a German government spokesperson said on Monday. The spokesperson also said Germany would welcome the US joining Europe in pushing for more sanctions against Russia. In a coordinated move, France and Germany have proposed further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy revenues, including listing non-sanctioned oil majors, such as privately owned Lukoil, as well as going after refineries in foreign countries that re-export Russian oil to the EU. The EU’s two key players also propose increasing pressure on Russia’s civilian economy, via measures targeting civil aviation and engineering. “Russia continues its stalling tactics and persists in refusing a ceasefire,” said a Franco-German paper that calls for increased pressure. Over the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested the US and EU could impose tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil. Bessent said the US was preparing to increase pressure on Russia and urged Europe to do more: “We need our European partners to follow us, because if the US and EU can do this together … we are in a race now between how long the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.” The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India in response to its purchases of discounted Russian oil, but declined to take such punitive action against other large buyers of Russian energy, such as China. The issue of secondary sanctions, which would apply penalties to third countries that trade with Russia, could be difficult for the EU, which is racing to sign new trade deals, including with India, by the end of the year to counter Trump’s tariffs that are roiling international relations. The US focus on Russian energy also puts an uncomfortable spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, favour Trump’s agenda but are also friendly to Putin and have opposed EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028 . skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU has pledged to buy $750bn of US oil, gas and nuclear products by 2028. The EU has approved 18 rounds of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, with further proposals expected in the coming days. The last set of EU sanctions, agreed in July, lowered the price cap on Russian oil, closed loopholes to reduce trade in Russian petroleum products and banned vessels carrying Russian energy from European ports. Speaking alongside Costa, Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said cooperation with the US on sanctions was crucial. The latest attacks on Ukraine showed, he said, “that Putin will not stop killing, he will not go to the negotiation tables. That is why we have to cooperate with and negotiate with the US to find a way to do more sanctions, stronger sanctions, do more military support to Ukraine, and build security arrangements to Ukraine.” View image in fullscreen The European Council president, Antonio Costa (left), and the Finnish prime minister, Petteri Orpo, during their joint press conference on Monday. Photograph: Roni Rekomaa/AP On Sunday Russia launched its largest-ever barrage on Ukraine , setting the main government building in Kyiv on fire, and killing at least four people, including a woman and her baby. Zelenskyy said Putin was testing the world to see “whether they will accept or tolerate this” and he urged Ukraine’s allies to impose more sanctions and “tough tariffs” on Russia. The Kremlin said on Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on Ukraine.
