Now angle your elbows slightly outward and separate your hands. If the latter position feels better, you may appreciate the design of an ergonomic keyboard. These boards split, tilt and/or angle the keys in so your shoulders and chest feel more open and your forearms and wrists stay aligned.<br/>Some ergonomic keyboards are fully split, some are unibody split (Alice designs). Some use a columnar orientation, have thumb clusters and take advantage of programmable keys. I tried more than 15 with a mix of all these features and included info about the benefits of various designs so you can pick the best ergonomic keyboard for you (because it won’t be the same for everyone).</p>\n<h2>Table of contents</h2>\n<h2>Best ergonomic keyboards for 2025</h2>\n<p><strong>Ergonomic features</strong>: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | <strong>Host connection</strong>: Bluetooth or USB receiver | <strong>Switch type</strong>: Scissor | <strong>Hotkey compatibility</strong>: Mac and Windows | <strong>Ten key</strong>: Yes | <strong>RGB lighting</strong>: No | <strong>Programing interface</strong>: Logi Options+ (app) | <strong>Language/Layout</strong>: QWERTY</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07ZWK2TQT&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=editorial-text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Ergo+K860+from+Logitech&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAZdwYhZexeW7LjUA-bOXwiHOtKwRz-njrV7TvdbOhZuG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLogitech-Wireless-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Wrist%2Fdp%2FB07ZWK2TQT%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">Ergo K860 from Logitech</a> closely resembles standard, full-size keyboard designs, so there’s not much of a learning curve. But subtle changes like the Alice layout, tented middle and optional negative tilt make typing noticeably more comfortable. I could keep my elbows comfortably away from my ribs, my wrists were straight and my palms could rotate naturally inward.</p>\n<p>The board connects quickly and reliably via Bluetooth, the build is solid and the price of $150 isn’t outrageous. It’s Mac, Windows, Chrome and Linux compatible (though you’ll need software for non-basic key functions for the latter two). Buttons allow you to swap between three previously connected devices, which worked great for me, even between a MacBook and a PC. Function keys like volume and brightness and the Option/Start and Command/Alt combo keys worked correctly on each machine.</p>\n<p>My only qualms are that the palm rest is not removable (though it’s springy and firm). The arrow keys and a numeric keypad on the right side adds length to that side of the board, which forces your mouse farther out. The scissor switch keys can feel mushy if you’re coming from a mechanical board, but they’re responsive enough to make this one of the best wireless ergonomic keyboards.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Rotated keys and palm rest make for comfortable typing</li>\n      <li>Wirelessly connects quickly to three devices</li>\n      <li>Hotkeys work with MacOS and Windows</li>\n    </ul>\n<ul>\n      <li>Takes up a large footprint</li>\n      <li>Wrist rest is not removable</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B07ZWK2TQT&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;providerId=amazon&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=dynamic-offer&amp;itemName=Logitech+Ergo+K860+Wireless+Split&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;itemSourceId=B07ZWK2TQT&amp;brand=Logitech&amp;categoryId=1928&amp;price=149.99&amp;salePrice=149.99&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAbsX4CeHADRd1C_eQin_Xqs64q3Z1awIKqY-I7fDngOf&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">$150 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Ergonomic features</strong>: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | <strong>Host connection</strong>: Bluetooth or USB-C | <strong>Switch type</strong>: Mechanical Gateron low-profile Brown | <strong>Hotkey compatibility</strong>: Mac or Windows (two models) | <strong>Ten key</strong>: Yes (with layers) | <strong>RGB lighting</strong>: No, just backlighting | <strong>Programing interface</strong>: Kinesis Clique (browser) | <strong>Language/Layout</strong>: QWERTY (programmable)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DYG1KPX7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=editorial-text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=mWave+from+Kinesis&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAb5qh70AdBWrkXbtafiIMKpxTtzdSSrhtpVvkMyC5vbU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKINESIS-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Programmable%2Fdp%2FB0DYG1KPX7&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">mWave from Kinesis</a> has very similar ergonomics to our top pick from Logitech. A unibody, tented, Alice-split design that makes typing more comfortable while not being difficult to learn. But this adds mechanical keys, a tenkeyless design and programmable layers — plus it’s about $30 cheaper. You also get three magnetic feet to create an optional negative tilt.</p>\n<p>The missing number pad lets right handed folk put their mouse closer but you can still use tenkey input using the layers function. In fact, all keys are programmable using Kenisis’ browser-based <a href=\"https://clique.kinesis-ergo.com/\">Clique</a> software. It’s not the simplest programming software and there aren’t a ton of extra or blank keys for you to mod, so if you want a lot of programmability, you’ll likely rely on layers. The mWave should also appeal to people who just want a plug-and-play option. It comes in two models, a white board with macOS function keys and a black PC version.</p>\n<p>One drawback is the sound from low-profile mechanical switches. They're springy and responsive but produce a loud, hollow <i>clunk</i> as you type. It also comes with an USB-C to A cable, which is a little dated for Mac users. The Kinesis rep confirmed the mWave was designed as a replacement for the now-discontinued Microsoft Sculpt — but with a <a href=\"https://kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/Kinesis-H2H_-mWave-v.-MS-Sculpt_4-25-25.pdf\">few upgrades</a> like mechanical keys, no dongle, and programmability.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Springy mechanical key switches</li>\n      <li>Plug and play versions for Mac or PC</li>\n      <li>Tenkeyless design is more compact, but layers offer an integrated keypad</li>\n      <li>Fully programmable</li>\n    </ul>\n<ul>\n      <li>Wrist rest not removable</li>\n      <li>Loud and clacky keys</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DYG1KPX7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;itemName=Kinesis+mWave+Mechanical+Keyboard&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAQXiIJ0eXA_5OFgKcQwFH2NZQxSWEF3nE3AQ6R5QqEPD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKINESIS-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Programmable%2Fdp%2FB0DYG1KPX7%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">$134 at Amazon</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;contentUuid=be94f161-d53c-4a53-91ef-ca670995efc7&amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;itemName=Kinesis+mWave+Mechanical+Keyboard&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2tpbmVzaXMtZXJnby5jb20vc2hvcC9td2F2ZS1tYWMvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZTk0ZjE2MS1kNTNjLTRhNTMtOTFlZi1jYTY3MDk5NWVmYzciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8va2luZXNpcy1lcmdvLmNvbS9zaG9wL213YXZlLW1hYy8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAX6kjWSBBXa7P13Vq_vxRoO7X-sADV1tfc_1HjpwUBGL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fkinesis-ergo.com%2Fshop%2Fmwave-mac%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">$133 at Kinesis</a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Ergonomic features</strong>: Fully split | <strong>Host connection</strong>: USB-C port | <strong>Switch type</strong>: Mechanical (tactile or linear) | <strong>Hotkey compatibility</strong>: Mac and Windows | <strong>Ten key</strong>: No | <strong>RGB lighting</strong>: Yes | <strong>Programing interface</strong>: QMK/VIA (browser) | <strong>Language/Layout</strong>: QWERTY</p>\n<p>If you (expertly) sawed a mechanical keyboard in two, it would look like the <a href=\"https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard\">Keychron Q11</a>.

But in India, it has taken on a creative life of its own, with retro portraits and local trends going viral — even as privacy and safety concerns begin to emerge.</p>\n<p>India has emerged as the No. 1 country in terms of Nano Banana usage, according to David Sharon, multimodal generation lead for Gemini Apps at Google DeepMind, who spoke at a media session this week. The model’s popularity has also propelled the Gemini app to the top of the free app charts on both the App Store and Google Play in India. The app has also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/gemini-tops-the-app-store-thanks-to-new-ai-image-model-nano-banana/\">climbed to the top of global app stores’ charts</a>, according to Appfigures.</p>\n<p>Given India’s scale — the world’s second-largest smartphone market and second-biggest online population after China — it is no surprise the country is leading in adoption. But what is catching Google’s attention is not just how many people are using Nano Banana, it is how: Millions of Indians are engaging with the AI model in ways that are uniquely local, highly creative, and in some cases, completely unexpected.</p>\n<p>One of the standout trends is Indians using Nano Banana to re-create retro looks inspired by 1990s Bollywood, imagining how they might have appeared during that era, complete with period-specific fashion, hairstyles, and makeup. This trend is local to India, Sharon told reporters.</p>\n<p>A variation of the retro trend is what some are calling the “AI saree,” where users generate vintage-style portraits of themselves wearing traditional Indian attire.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</p>\n<p>Another trend local to India is people generating their selfies in front of cityscapes and iconic landmarks, such as Big Ben and the U.K.’s retro telephone booths.</p>\n<p>“We saw a lot of that in the beginning,” Sharon said.</p>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<p>Indian users are also experimenting with Nano Banana to transform objects, create time-travel effects, and even reimagine themselves as retro postage stamps. Others are generating black-and-white portraits or using the model to visualize encounters with their younger selves.</p>\n<p>Some of these trends did not originate in India, but the country played a key role in helping them gain global attention. One example is the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/778106/google-gemini-nano-banana-image-editor\">figurine trend</a>, where people generate miniature versions of themselves, often placing them in front of a computer screen. The trend first emerged in Thailand, spread to Indonesia, and became global after gaining traction in India, Sharon said.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</p>\n<p>In addition to Nano Banana, Google has observed a trend where Indian users are utilizing its Veo 3 AI video-generation model on the Gemini app to create short videos from old photos of their grandparents and great-grandparents.</p>\n<p>All of this has helped drive Gemini’s popularity on both the App Store and Google Play in India. Between January and August, the app saw an average of 1.9 million monthly downloads in the country — about 55% higher than in the U.S. — accounting for 16.6% of global monthly downloads, per Appfigures data shared exclusively with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>India downloads have totaled 15.2 million this year until August; the U.S., on the other hand, has had 9.8 million downloads so far this year, per Appfigures data.</p>\n<p>Daily downloads of the Gemini app in India significantly surged following the release of the Nano Banana update, beginning on September 1 with 55,000 installs across both app stores. Downloads peaked at 414,000 on September 13 — a 667% increase — with Gemini holding the top overall spot on the iOS App Store since September 10 and on Google Play since September 12, including across all categories, Appfigures data shows.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch</p>\n<p>Despite India leading in downloads, the country does not top in-app purchases on the Gemini app, which has generated an estimated $6.4 million in global consumer spending on iOS since launch, per Appfigures. The U.S. accounts for the largest share at $2.3 million (35%), while India contributes $95,000 (1.5%). However, India posted a record 18% month-over-month growth in spending, reaching $13,000 between September 1 and 16 — compared to an 11% global increase during the same period. That puts India seven percentage points above the global rate and more than 17 points ahead of the U.S., where growth was under 1%.</p>\n<p>That said, as with other AI apps, there are concerns about users uploading personal photos to Gemini to transform their appearance.</p>\n<p>“When a user asks us to fulfill their query, we do our best to fulfill that query. We don’t try to assume what the user’s intent is,” Sharon said while addressing questions on how Google is dealing with data misuse and privacy concerns among users in India and other top markets. “We’ve really tried to improve that, and we have improved that to be bold and fulfil your request.”</p>\n<p>Google places a visible, diamond-shaped watermark on images generated by the Nano Banana model and also embeds a hidden marker using its <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/\">SynthID tool</a> to identify AI-generated content. SynthID allows Google to detect and flag whether an image was created using its models.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/india-leads-the-way-on-googles-nano-banana-with-a-local-creative-twist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Meta on Wednesday unveiled a new pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses with a built-in display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that picks up on subtle hand gestures, called Meta Neural Band, the same one it unveiled at last year’s Connect as part of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/28/meta-offers-a-glimpse-through-its-supposed-iphone-killer-orion/\">Orion demo</a>.</p><p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the new product, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, onstage at the company’s annual developer conference, Meta Connect 2025. Unlike Orion, Zuckerberg says this is a product that people can buy in a couple of weeks, starting September 30, and they’ll cost $799.</p><p>This is Meta’s latest attempt to ship a pair of consumer smart glasses that can handle many of the tasks users traditionally do on a smartphone. For years, Meta has been forced to reach users through its competitors’ devices, namely those sold by Google and Apple. While Meta has invested billions in virtual reality headsets, AI-powered smart glasses now seem like the most promising way for the company to connect with users on its own hardware.</p><p>With the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta aims to build off the success of its original Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which the company has sold <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings\">millions of pairs</a> of with its eyewear partner, EssilorLuxottica. Much like Ray-Ban Meta, the Meta Ray-Ban Display comes equipped with an on-board AI assistant, as well as cameras, speakers, and microphones. The glasses let users connect to the cloud to access the internet and social media apps.</p><graphic src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-8.24.11PM.png?w=680\"/><p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</p><p>Meta says the display enables users to do much more with their smart glasses. Users are capable of displaying Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Users can also view directions and see live translations in the smart glasses’ display.</p><p>The Neural Band that ships alongside the device looks similar to a Fitbit, but without a screen, and allows users to navigate apps with small hand movements. Zuckerberg said onstage that the Meta Neural Band has 18 hours of battery life and is water resistant.</p><p>The device uses electromyography (EMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture. Meta is betting this interface will be a new way users can control their devices.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

CNBC and Bloomberg previously reported that the smart glasses, which were internally codenamed Hypernova, would be unveiled at this year’s Connect conference. </p><p>It’s worth noting that Meta Ray-Ban Display are far less capable than the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-teases-orion-brain-powered-true-ar-glasses-in-a-tiny-package/\">Orion smart glasses</a> Meta showed off at Connect 2024. That device featured augmented reality lenses and eye tracking, while this pair uses a much simpler display. It may be years before Meta ever sells Orion.</p><p>Still, Meta is hoping it can win the smart glasses race by being first to market with a real product. However, it seems likely that Google and Apple will launch smart glasses of their own in the years to come. Those devices will undoubtedly be able to integrate into Google and Apple’s respective operating systems, giving them a significant leg up over Meta.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Starmer and Trump to hold talks as PM warned UK faces ‘huge dilemma’ over relationship with US</p>\n<p>Good morning. It’s day two of the state visit and, after the pomp, today we’re on to the policy. Donald Trump is leaving Windsor Castle and heading for Chequers where he will have private talks with Keir Starmer before the two leaders hold a press conference.</p>\n<p>In his speech at the state banquet last night, Trump delivered used some uncharacteristically sophisticated and lovely metaphors to describe the US/UK relationship. He said:</p>\n<p>We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny.</p>\n<p>We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.</p>\n<p>Starmer defends his use of flattery diplomacy with Trump on the grounds that it delivers for Britain and, with No 10 announcing US investments in the UK worth £150bn there is evidence to suggest it’s working.</p>\n<p>But, to return to Trump’s analogy, there are others who suspect that, if anything is being “played” in all of this, it’s us.</p>\n<p>On the Today programme this morning Nick Clegg came close to expressing this view. As a former Lib Dem deputy prime minister in the 2010-15 coalition government, and a former president of global affairs at Meta, he is very well placed to comment on the relationship. Clegg told Today that the AI investments being anounced for the UK were “crumbs from the Silicon Valley table”. He said he thought the UK had become over-dependent on American technology. And he went on:</p>\n<p>Because of the very close partnership we’ve had with the United States, understandably so in the cold war period, I think we’ve been quite relaxed about this very heavy dependency … both in the public and the private sector, on American technology.</p>\n<p>I just so happen to believe that is now changing because the rupture – notwithstanding the pomp and ceremony of the state visit by Donald Trump this week – the transatlantic rupture, in my view, is real.</p>\n<p>I think the Americans – and we’ve been on notice for this for ages – are turning their attention to the Pacific. They have much less attachment to the transatlantic relationship.</p>\n<p>So my view is, over time, British governments need to learn to ask themselves different questions to how we can roll out the red carpet to American investment, welcome as that is. We need to ask ourselves questions about how we can develop and grow … our own technology companies to the size the need to be.</p>\n<p>Clegg said the UK faced “a huge dilemma”.</p>\n<p>We’ve got to learn, technologically, as much as in so many other walks of life, to stand more on own two feet, rather than just cling on to Uncle Sam’s coattails.</p>\n<p>While that served us well for a while, I think that’s no longer going to be the paradigm that works for us going forward.</p>\n<p>Today I will be focusing mostly on the Trump visit, although I will cover some other UK politics too. Here is the agenda for the day.</p>\n<p>10am: Donald Trump leaves Windsor Castle</p>\n<p>Morning: Melania Trump and Queen Camilla visit Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House in Windsor and Frogmore Gardens</p>\n<p>10.45am: Trump is due to arrive at Chequers, where he will hold bilateral talks with Keir Starmer. The two leaders are also speaking at an event for business leaders, and viewing items from the Winston Churchill archive at the mansion, the official country residence of the PM. And there will be a parachute display by the Red Devils.</p>\n<p>Around 2.30pm: Starmer and Trump hold a press conference at Chequers.</p>\n<p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm BST at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p>\n<p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p>\n<p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>\n<p>Zelenskyy offers 'deepest thanks' to King Charles for his 'steadfast support' for Ukraine in state banquet speech</p>\n<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has thanked King Charles for what he said at the state banquet last night strongly supporting the Ukrainian cause.</p>\n<p>I extend my deepest thanks to His Majesty King Charles III @RoyalFamily for his steadfast support. Ukraine greatly values the United Kingdom’s unwavering and principled stance.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/18/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-keir-starmer-labour-politics-latest-news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The company has fast <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-has-already-won-the-smart-glasses-race/\">become the leader</a> of the smart glasses race, having sold millions of units since launching its partnership with Ray-Ban in 2023. In July of this year, Meta further solidified its priorities by investing an estimated $3.5 billion to secure a minority stake in the eyewear company EssilorLuxottica, which owns Ray-Ban, Oakley, and numerous other eyeglass brands.</p>\n<p>Meta sees its wearable tech as a natural conduit for its AI efforts, including its voice-controlled chatbot. During an earnings call earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believes that in the future, people who don’t wear smart glasses will find themselves at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” compared with people who do wear them.</p>\n<p>The new smart glasses were officially revealed at Meta Connect despite the fact that Meta had scooped itself by <a href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-hud-wristband-clips-leak/\">accidentally leaking</a> the news of its new glasses two days earlier.</p>\n<p>We had a chance to try on all the new spectacles, both at Meta Connect in Menlo Park, California, and at an exclusive preview event in London. Here are the details on all the glasses Meta showed off.</p>\n<h2>Meta Ray-Ban Display</h2>\n<p>The new flagship product in the Meta glasses lineup is the Meta Ray-Ban Display, a wearable computing system for augmented reality. It feels like the first commercial step towards realizing the Orion glasses Meta <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-orion-glasses-augmented-reality-mark-zuckerberg/\">teased at Connect</a> last year.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, this is the first pair of Meta glasses you can buy that displays text, images, and video directly on the lens, allowing users to see WhatsApp messages, Instagram Reels, and video calls all completely within the glasses. The display window pops up in the right eye lens. The resolution is 42 ppd (pixels per degree). If you close your left eye and just look through the eye in front of the screen, the display view looks great. Trying to read the display while looking through the glasses with both eyes feels like crossing your eyes and takes quite a bit of getting used to.</p>\n<p>Interacting with the Display requires the use of Meta’s Neural Band, a wristband that can detect a range of subtle hand gestures. The gestures it can recognize include a tap of the index and middle fingers to select, go back, or to wake and sleep the display; a swipe of the thumb across the index finger to navigate menus; and pinch and twist movements for controlling music volume or camera zooms. There’s also a double thumb tap for manually waking up the Meta AI chatbot instead of using a wake word.</p>\n<p>It takes time to realize you don’t have to hold your hand out in front of you for these gestures to be recognized, but a surprisingly short amount of time to find yourself using them with very little second thought.</p>\n<p>Of course talking to Meta AI remains a key way of interacting with the glasses, but Meta hopes that adding the visual elements will enhance the chatbot experience. For example, live speech captioning and language translation is still switched on by voice—but with Meta Ray-Ban Display, you can see the translations and captions appearing in real time on the glasses rather than on your phone’s screen. This is the same with commands like “Hey Meta, what am I looking at?” which can now offer more visually rich information about whatever the front-facing cameras are pointing at. Asking Meta to navigate to a local attraction results in the glasses displaying turn-by-turn directions directly on top of the real world as you walk.</p>\n<p>For times when talking might be difficult, Meta also showed off a feature that tracks handwriting input as an alternative to voice commands. Aimed at quick messages, the user can “draw” letters with an outstretched finger on a flat service (or your leg), and the Neural Band will turn it into text. Though the feature was part of the demo we received, Meta says it won't be available to users at launch, but will arrive soon. Who knows, maybe this will be the thing that helps <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-end-of-handwriting/\">save handwriting</a>.</p>\n<p>Meta has acknowledged some limitations with features at launch. For example, the built-in Spotify integration is only able to show what’s playing on your phone and give you basic playback controls, and Instagram is currently limited to just Reels and messages. Meta intends to broaden out the capabilities soon.</p>\n<p>Also notable: The Orion prototype we saw last year required an external puck to power its most computing-intensive capabilities. But that prototype design provides a full range of augmented-reality features. The AR feature set of this new Display model is more limited, so the puck isn't needed. Also, this means the Display's frames are slimmer. Meta does eventually plan to offer a full slate of wearable options to consumers: smart glasses, display glasses, and full AR glasses.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-smart-glasses-ray-ban-display-ray-ban-gen-2-oakley-vanguard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Here are the last 10 Wordle answers:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>September 8:</strong>CHIRP</li>\n      <li><strong>September 9:</strong>TRICK</li>\n      <li><strong>September 10:</strong>POUTY</li>\n      <li><strong>September 11:</strong>CHAIR</li>\n      <li><strong>September 12:</strong>THROB</li>\n      <li><strong>September 13:</strong>NADIR</li>\n      <li><strong>September 14:</strong>NOISY</li>\n      <li><strong>September 15:</strong>ALONG</li>\n      <li><strong>September 16:</strong>LEFTY</li>\n      <li><strong>September 17:</strong>TEETH</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Learn more about Wordle</h2>\n    <h2>How to play Wordle</h2>\n    <p>Wordle's a daily guessing game, where the goal is to correctly uncover today's five letter word in six goes or less. An incorrect letter shows up as a grey box. A correct letter in the wrong space turns up yellow. And the correct letter in the right place shows up as green. There's no time limit to worry about, and don't forget that some letters might be used more than once.</p>\n    <h2>What's the best Wordle starting word?</h2>\n    <p>Generally you want to pick something with a good mix of common consonants and vowels in it as your Wordle opener, as this is most likely to return some early green and yellow letters. Words like SLATE, CHIME, and REACT all work, but feel free to find your own favourite.</p>\n    <h2>Is Wordle getting harder?</h2>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i3bonQ5rxzT5qB9kbg4WbJ.jpeg\" alt=\"Team Fortress 2 Engineer avatar\"/></p>\n    <p>Wordle is not getting harder!</p>\n    <p>There will always be the occasional day where the answer is the name of a body part, has a sneaky double vowel, or a word obscure enough to send everyone rushing off to a dictionary. But the daily answers, edited by Tracy Bennett, are still a good mix of common terms and tougher challenges.</p>\n    <p>Remember that if you're <i>craving</i> more of a challenge, you can enable <strong>Hard Mode</strong> under the ⚙️ options menu. This option doesn't make the words themselves harder, but it requires that \"any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses.\"</p>\n    <h2>How did Wordle begin?</h2>\n    <p>Wordle is the creation of Josh Wardle, and began life as a small personal project before its public release in 2021. From there it's gone on to become a global phenomenon, attracting a dedicated daily audience, billions of plays, a whole host of competitors, and even a <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/wordle-sells-to-the-new-york-times-for-a-seven-figure-sum/\">seven-figure sale</a> to the New York Times where it's become a mainstay of daily games alongside the crosswords and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/nyt-connections/\">Connections</a>.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YdWVVjkXZcPuYc934RqzhT.jpeg\" alt=\"Kerry Brunskill\"/>\n    <p>When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the daily <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/todays-wordle-433-answer-hint/\">Wordle</a> puzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.</p>\n    <p>Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features on <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/action-rpg-elm-knight-may-be-30-years-old-but-it-still-feels-like-its-from-the-future/\">old Japanese PC games</a>, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.</p>\n    <p>You must confirm your public display name before commenting</p>\n    <p>Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/wordle-answer-today-september-18-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Based on the reactions and vengeful affect of returning Dying Light 1 protagonist Kyle Crane, it seems the juice was bad. And yet it helps you kill zombies, so it might be good? Such are the fascinating moral complexities offered by zombie fiction.</p>\n    <p>Perhaps the true beast… is <i>humanity!? </i>Or it's the guy with experimental zombie super strength who can rip mutants apart with his bare hands. Hard to say.</p>\n    <p>If you're desperate to learn when you'll be able to go Beast mode in the latest Dying Light, don't fret: You won't have to endure years of zombie DNA experimentation. We've got the launch times for Dying Light: The Beast collected below.</p>\n    <h2>When does Dying Light: The Beast unlock?</h2>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Big news!

Except it probably won't be that lighthearted. Kyle Crane's not having a good time.</p>\n    <p>Here's the full rundown of Dying Light: The Beast unlock times in timezones around the world:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong>9 am PDT on Thursday, September 18</li>\n      <li><strong>New York:</strong>12 pm EDT on Thursday, September 18</li>\n      <li><strong>London:</strong>5 pm BST on Thursday, September 18</li>\n      <li><strong>Berlin:</strong>6 pm CEST on Thursday, September 18</li>\n      <li><strong>Sydney:</strong>2 am AEST on Friday, September 19</li>\n      <li><strong>Wellington:</strong>4 am NZST on Friday, September 19</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Does Dying Light: The Beast have preloading?</h2>\n    <p>Yes, but it arrived at just about the last minute. Preloading for Dying Light: The Beast will be available at <strong>9 pm PDT on Wednesday, September 17</strong>—just 12 hours before launch time. An earlier preload might have been more useful, but you'll at least be able to start your download before work if you won't be playing until the evening.

In the original Hollow Knight, accessing Steel Soul Mode meant defeating the main game at least once. In Silksong the same is true, except there is also another easier and quicker way to unlock it too.</p>\n    <p>But first, what is it? Steel Soul Mode is basically a permadeath mode for Silksong. When you die it's game over, and if you try to re-access the save file you'll be asked if you want to overwrite it. There's no going back, and as a result some items related to death have also changed in Steel Soul mode. For example: the Dead Bug's Purse, a tool which lets you retain half of your rosaries on death, becomes a Shell Satchel, which increases Hornet's tool pouch size.</p>\n    <p>If Hollow Knight's Steel Soul mode is any indication, there will also be some minor changes and additions in the adventure that will make the punishment worthwhile for completionists.</p>\n    <h2>How to unlock Steel Soul Mode in Silksong</h2>\n    <p>The most legitimate way of unlocking Steel Soul mode in Silksong is to simply complete the main game. But if you want to dive straight into it before that, you have to head to the \"Extras\" screen from the main menu and input the following:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Yes, that is a shortened version of <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/a-konami-code-variant-in-castlevania-has-been-discovered-after-a-quarter-of-a-century/\"> the Konami code</a>.</p>\n    <p>If you input these commands correctly you'll hear a deep \"whoosh\" sound, and the screen will flash white very briefly. Then, when you start a new game in an empty save slot you'll be given the option to start in Steel Soul Mode:</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLudnVpG9ik6s8boiqpD4C.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from Silksong showing the mode select screen once &amp;#039;Steel Soul&amp;#039; mode is unlocked\"/></p>\n    <p>If you die on your run—and I mean, you probably will?—this is the new death screen you'll encounter:</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCMMFVaBJGjJccM98ijPkJ.jpg\" alt=\"A screenshot from Silksong showing the game over screen that appears when Hornet dies in Steel Soul mode\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know/\"> Silksong guide</a>: Home of all our bug-battling tips</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-fleas-locations/\">: Gather the lost fleas</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Silksong flea locations</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/silksong-moorwing-boss-cheese-skip/\">: How to cheese or beat it</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>How to beat Moorwing</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/\">: Yes there is one</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Hunter's March bench</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-simple-key-locations/\">: Where to use the costly key</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Silksong simple key</strong>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VHK6WWHuYbRyFX3dSXbr3G.jpg\" alt=\"Shaun Prescott\"/>\n    <p>Shaun Prescott is the Australian editor of PC Gamer.

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner identified the victim as 15-year-old Celeste Rivas from Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, who was reported missing last year.</p>\n    <p>The circumstances of her death and how she ended up in the car are unclear and are still being investigated. The Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division is leading the investigation. No arrests have been made.</p>\n    <p>On September 8, police responded to a call at an impound lot in Hollywood for “a foul odor coming from a vehicle,” according to Los Angeles police. Authorities <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/09/corpse-found-in-trunk-of-vehicle-registered-to-d4vd/\">located a body</a> in a state of decomposition in the front trunk of the Tesla.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/missing-person-celeste-rivas-hernandez-805x1024.jpg\" alt=\"missing person poster celeste rivas hernandez\"/>\n    <p>Photo Credit: Riverside Sheriff’s Office</p>\n    <h4>Celeste Rivas was about 5’1” with wavy black hair and was wearing a tube top, black leggings, a yellow metal bracelet, and metal stud earrings, <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/09/17/d4vd-tesla-girl-found-dead-identity-celeste-rivas/\">according</a> to the medical examiner. She had a tattoo on her right index finger that said, “Shhh…”</h4>\n    <p>The vehicle is registered to 20-year-old David Anthony Burke, better known as singer D4vd. It is one of several vehicles he owns, with many different people using any of the vehicles at any given time, according to a senior LAPD source.</p>\n    <p>Notably, D4vd has the same “Shhh…” tattoo on his right index finger—but the design was popularized by superstar Rihanna in 2009. While it’s an interesting coincidence, it doesn’t indicate a connection between the singer and the victim aside from the vehicle being registered in his name.</p>\n    <p>D4vd was also not in town when the body was located; he was on tour for his ongoing Withered World Tour, which is scheduled to bring him to Los Angeles on Saturday. However, his Wednesday show in Seattle was cancelled.</p>\n    <p>According to his representatives, <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/09/corpse-found-in-trunk-of-vehicle-registered-to-d4vd/\">D4vd is cooperating with authorities</a> during the investigation. Screenshots have begun circulating online, especially Twitter, showcasing D4vd’s long-term relationship with the missing girl. At one point in 2024, D4vd <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/d4vds-discord-server-did-celeste-rivas-chat-with-the-singer-since-2022-what-we-know-101758148240862.html\">allegedly</a> told his Discord chat, “I’m in a song crisis right now.” To which someone replied, “drop the one with the missing girl celeste rivas hernandez.” Notably the date on the timestamp is August 16, 2024 and shows no indication of being edited.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/d4vd-discord.png\"/>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/body-found-in-d4vd-car-identified-missing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The 30-show concert series has spurred a short-term travel surge when tourism is low due to hurricane season.</p>\n    <p>Between June and November—the Atlantic hurricane season—Puerto Rico’s tourism usually drops by as much as 45%, while prices for accommodations can fall by up to 50%, according to tourism agency Discovery Puerto Rico. Tourism accounts for around 7% of the island’s $114 billion economy.</p>\n    <h4>But that’s when Bad Bunny isn’t in town. During the Puerto Rican rapper’s residency, which ended on September 14, he broke attendance records at Puerto Rico’s Coliseum with nearly 600,000 attendees. Even more impressively, those attendees had an estimated economic impact of $713 million.</h4>\n    <p>That’s one of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/business/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-economy.html\">most financially significant events</a> for the island in the last ten years, according to a study by Gaither International. Those figures reveal that Bad Bunny’s residency not only demonstrated his star power, but turned the spotlight on the way a world-class entertainer can strengthen Puerto Rico’s local economy. Further, it can inject tourism into the territory during the off-season and solidify Puerto Rico’s place as a musical—and cultural—destination.</p>\n    <p>The first near-third of shows was reserved only for Puerto Rico residents, but international attendance grew throughout the rest of the residency. An average of 55% of attendees were residents of Puerto Rico, while 39% were from the United States, and 6% were from other countries, predominantly the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Mexico, and Spain.</p>\n    <h4>Of those, Puerto Rican residents contributed around $126 million. Visitors from the rest of the United States generated $507 million, and those from other countries generated around $80 million.</h4>\n    <p>More than half of the foreign visitors said that a Bad Bunny performance was the main reason for their trip, with an average stay of 8.7 nights. Locals who traveled to San Juan stayed around 1.5 nights. Accommodations were divided between hotels (33%), short-term rentals like Airbnb (20%), and homes of friends or relatives (47%).</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, 82% of tourists visited Puerto Rico’s beaches, while 69% visited restaurants, 57% enjoyed the nightlife, and 55% toured Old San Juan. The sectors that saw the greatest benefits include lodging, gastronomy, transportation, nightlife, retail, production services, and experiential tourism (beaches, tours, Old San Juan).</p>\n    <h4>Airlines also saw increases in flight frequency from the U.S. to Puerto Rico at approximately 20% over the summer. Public transportation in Puerto Rico, including Uber, Lyft, and taxis, saw increased operation on concert nights.</h4>\n    <p>“The bittersweet component is that this <a href=\"https://www.wjournalpr.com/top-stories/bad-bunny-residency-injects-713-million-into-puerto-ricos-economy/article_f39739d5-d8f4-47ec-b494-55a63be10fae.html\">stimulus</a> really isn’t going to last,” said Jesse Rogers, Head of LatAm Economics at Moody’s Analytics. “You actually get a slightly slower growth in 2026 as that stimulus fades.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.airdna.co/press/bad-bunny-tourism\">According</a> to AirDNA, which tracks short-term and vacation rentals worldwide, revenue from short-term rentals in San Juan more than doubled from last year.</p>\n    <p>“You see this kind of bump when it’s the Paris Olympics or the Super Bowl, but those are short stints,” added Jamie Lane, Chief Economist at AirDNA. “This is the first time we’ve seen it consistently in one city.”</p>\n    <p>Overall, the figures exceeded all projections. The projected impact was initially <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/10/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-tour/\">estimated at around $200 million</a>. But that continued to rise, reaching an average of $400 million. A study by Advantage Business Consulting projected an economic impact for Puerto Rico of $377 million, of which approximately $302 million is concentrated in San Juan.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-travel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tKeep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR.  Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tGenerally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers – within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a <a href=\"https://www.comparecards.com\">credit card</a> that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.<br/>&#13;\n\t<br/>&#13;\n\tThe interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Methodology</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Credit scores ranges may vary.

It was quite surreal because he's somebody you don't expect to see in Bangor Golf Club.</p>\n    <p>\"It was a lovely surprise. I was just made up that someone would actually make that effort to fly in for an evening.\"</p>\n    <p>It is now approaching three decades since the pair wreaked havoc for Newcastle against the mighty Barcelona.</p>\n    <p>But some friendships, clearly, stand the test of time.</p>\n    <p>\"We clicked that night,\" Gillespie said.</p>\n    <p>Now, as Newcastle prepare to face the Catalan giants once again, Asprilla will be among those watching on at St James' Park on Thursday night.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published1 day ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published4 days ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>'Tino had a look in his eye'</h2>\n    <p>In truth, the whole team clicked back in September 1997.</p>\n    <p>It may have been Newcastle's first-ever game in the Champions League proper, but former defender Philippe Albert felt \"we had nothing to lose because Barcelona were the big favourites\".</p>\n    <p>And Shay Given, who was in goal that night, suggested that the Catalan giants \"thought they would only have to turn up and they would beat us\".</p>\n    <p>That did not prove to be the case at a rocking St James' Park.</p>\n    <p>\"I had never witnessed an atmosphere like that before,\" Given said. \"Unbelievable.\"</p>\n    <p>Yet it was not exactly a foregone conclusion that match-winner Asprilla would even feature – let alone score a hat-trick in his side's 3-2 victory.</p>\n    <p>Gillespie recalled how Asprilla \"arrived late from international duty the previous weekend so there was talk he might not be playing\".</p>\n    <p>But manager Sir Kenny Dalglish did not exactly have a plethora of options up front.</p>\n    <p>Alan Shearer was sidelined with a serious ankle injury while Les Ferdinand had been sold to Spurs just a couple of months previously.</p>\n    <p>No wonder former right-back Warren Barton remembered \"Kenny giving Tino the benefit of the doubt\".</p>\n    <p>It was hardly the ideal build-up for a match of this magnitude, but Barton could sense his team-mate was \"in the zone\" that night.</p>\n    <p>\"Tino was always very quiet before the games,\" he said. \"But he just had an aura about him and a look in his eye. This was his stage.\"</p>\n    <p>It did not take Asprilla long to make an impact, the striker winning a penalty and putting his side in front from the spot midway through the first half.</p>\n    <p>It was quickly apparent that he was in the mood.</p>\n    <p>\"A lot of times you knew after two or three minutes what Tino you were going to get,\" Gillespie said. \"Sometimes he could be terrible, but he was outstanding more often than not.\"</p>\n    <h2>Gillespie and Asprilla combine</h2>\n    <p>It was not just Asprilla who had the game of his life.</p>\n    <p>Gillespie was the first to admit he was a \"little bit in awe\" as he looked across the tunnel before the game and saw Rivaldo, Luis Figo, Luis Enrique and Ivan de la Pena staring ahead.</p>\n    <p>But the Northern Irishman did not know much about Sergi, who was rated as one of the best left-backs in Europe at the time.</p>\n    <p>Gillespie wanted to test out his marker to see how quick he was.</p>\n    <p>And once the winger knew he had the beating of Sergi, he repeatedly demanded the ball out on the right.</p>\n    <p>Rather than having a trick up his sleeve, Gillespie \"dropped the shoulder because he knew he was going to get there first\" and whipped the ball into the box.</p>\n    <p>Asprilla did the rest.</p>\n    <p>Not only did Asprilla double his side's lead with a bullet header, he made it 3-0 with a near-identical goal to leave Newcastle owner Sir John Hall stunned.</p>\n    <p>\"Tino was inspirational that night,\" Sir John said. \"You could see him hang in the air when the ball came to him - and bang!\"</p>\n    <p>Barcelona pulled two goals back, through Luis Enrique and Figo, but Newcastle held on. Just.</p>\n    <p>It remains one of the most famous results in the club's history.</p>\n    <p>In some ways, it was rather fitting that Asprilla never scored another goal for the club before re-joining Parma a few months later.</p>\n    <p>How could it get any better?</p>\n    <p>Barton called it the Colombian's \"pinnacle\".</p>\n    <h2>The balance shifts</h2>\n    <p>These were the nights Asprilla came alive.</p>\n    <p>Indeed, it did not feel a coincidence that the striker scored as many goals (nine) for Newcastle in 11 European games as he did in 48 Premier League fixtures.</p>\n    <p>Yet Asprilla's top-flight debut was one to remember following his £6.7m move from Parma in February 1996.</p>\n    <p>The new signing was not scheduled to play so soon after touching down in the snow in a fur coat a few days previously.</p>\n    <p>He even helped himself to a glass of red wine with his pre-match meal before the game against Middlesbrough.</p>\n    <p>But Kevin Keegan, who was Newcastle's manager at the time, felt moved to throw on his record signing after watching his side go 1-0 down at the Riverside.</p>\n    <p>Asprilla duly set up Steve Watson's equaliser and the maverick's rubber legs helped turn the game on its head as the league leaders ran out 2-1 winners.</p>\n    <p>\"As soon as he came in, he made the difference,\" Albert said. \"Only the great players can do something like this.\"</p>\n    <p>It gave Keegan food for thought at a critical juncture of the title race.</p>\n    <p>Newcastle had won seven of their eight previous top-flight fixtures, but Keegan was privately concerned that his side were becoming a little predictable.</p>\n    <p>So the Newcastle manager tweaked his starting line-up to accommodate Asprilla.</p>\n    <p>Gillespie recalled how the \"balance of the team changed\" as the Northern Irishman dropped out and Peter Beardsley moved over to the right.</p>\n    <p>\"Going from the 4-4-2 we played, Peter was not a winger,\" he said. \"Peter was not going to do what I did and go down the line and get crosses in for the likes of Les [Ferdinand] in the middle.</p>\n    <p>\"But it was probably easy to drop me. I was the youngest player in the squad and I wasn't one to go knocking on doors and being confrontational with managers.\"</p>\n    <p>Gillespie, however, made it clear that Newcastle had signed \"two great players\" in Asprilla and fellow mid-season arrival David Batty, and he instead gave Manchester United \"credit for the way they came back with that run\".</p>\n    <p>The pair became easy targets for outsiders after Newcastle went on to lose out on the title to Manchester United, who won 13 of their final 15 league games.</p>\n    <p>But Keegan felt it was \"scandalous\" to blame Batty and Asprilla and instead pointed to a number of key players losing form.</p>\n    <h2>'Tino will never be forgotten'</h2>\n    <p>Those who Asprilla shared a dressing room with felt similarly.</p>\n    <p>Albert recalled how there were training sessions when Asprilla was disinterested and \"with us without being with us\".</p>\n    <p>His poor timekeeping has also been well-documented.</p>\n    <p>But Asprilla was an immensely popular figure who Albert said was \"one of us from day one\".</p>\n    <p>Asprilla's concerned team-mates once even got a taxi to his house after he did not show up for a team lunch in Newcastle, only to find him asleep following a night on the town.</p>\n    <p>This was a \"funny character\" in the words of Given, who joined the club 18 months after Asprilla's arrival.</p>\n    <p>\"Tino just had real personality on the pitch - and off it as well,\" he said. \"His English wasn't great, but he knew a lot of swear words. I know that much.\"</p>\n    <p>He was also a player who was \"unplayable\" on his day - not least against Barcelona.</p>\n    <p>With Asprilla watching from the stands on Thursday, the current side do not have to look too far into the history books for inspiration, as Barton knows only too well.</p>\n    <p>\"We didn't win anything that night, but Tino won the hearts of the fans,\" he said. \"He will never be forgotten for that.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published26 July 2022</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"Newcastle United club badge\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2048/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/1588C/production/_126040288_newcastleunitedjustbadge2022-23.png 976w\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0r01j810gwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They have had good young players who were trying to reach the top [echelons] of football like Victor Osimhen, Edinson Cavani and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.</p>\n    <p>\"De Bruyne is the one that is already famous when coming to Naples and is technically on another level compared to the other players. He is the only one capable of playing the ball 60 metres with precision. He is an important resource of Conte because he adds something different.\"</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c3d41nepkk7o\">BBC Sport reported</a> in May there was disappointment from De Bruyne that City had not offered him a contract extension.</p>\n    <p>After an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c2011dze78xo\">emotional send-off</a> from the club which brought boss Pep Guardiola to tears, the midfielder will be given a hero's welcome on Thursday as he returns to a place he describes as \"home\".</p>\n    <p>De Bruyne appears to have fitted in seamlessly at his new residence, scoring two goals in his opening three games, and the City defenders will know first-hand the quality he possesses.</p>\n    <p>Guardiola said it will be \"nice to have him back\" and players at De Bruyne's level \"don't need that much time to adapt\".</p>\n    <p>\"I have spoken to Kevin and have asked him a few things,\" added Conte. \"He has been part of this club for 10 years and has had a great coach like Pep Guardiola.</p>\n    <p>\"He will be excited to be playing but I am hoping after the first whistle he will find his feet and remember that he is playing for Napoli and contribute like he has been doing.\"</p>\n    <h2>Former Man Utd men to take revenge?</h2>\n    <p>Danish striker Hojlund was unceremoniously bombed out by Manchester United and both he and Scott McTominay may well have been glad they left after seeing their former club taken apart by City in Sunday's 3-0 Premier League win.</p>\n    <p>Hojlund, 22, is aiming to put his difficult spell at Old Trafford behind him and began his Napoli spell in a dream fashion, scoring on his debut in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c9v7kgpzxnxt\">3-1 win at Fiorentina</a> last Saturday.</p>\n    <p>Midfielder McTominay trod the same path last summer by escaping the chaos of United in moving to Naples and the 28-year-old instantly became a cult hero, netting 12 goals to inspire their title success.</p>\n    <p>Such has been his impact, the Scotland international has a mural similar to Maradona in the city and has been nominated to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award for the best player in the world - something which would have been unthinkable while at United.</p>\n    <p>Conte said he saw \"great potential\" in McTominay and could not believe he had the opportunity to sign him when he became available last summer.</p>\n    <p>Credendino added: \"Conte's system is starting to lose the traditional definition of 'formation' by putting De Bruyne and McTominay on the field at the same time. It is a really fluid system. McTominay may start on the left but he always drifts inside the pitch.</p>\n    <p>\"When you have Hojlund, who runs fast towards the goal, De Bruyne's ability with his feet can help the ball to him.\"</p>\n    <p>Whatever the result on Thursday, De Bruyne's iconic status at City is assured, but now he will be aiming to achieve the same at Napoli.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx20ql96dx5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This is a helpful perk if you plan on buying anything with the card.<strong>Choose your payment due date:</strong> A little flexibility can go a long way when it comes to managing your finances. The card lets you choose from any available payment date, whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the month. That way, you can set up automatic payments that are aligned with your paycheck.<strong>No late fees:</strong> One of the most unique perks is that there are no late fees, ever. While you should always pay your bill on time, because late payments can still affect your credit, it's nice to know that you won't be charged if you do slip up and miss a payment.<strong>No penalty APR:</strong> If you miss some payments, most credit cards will increase your interest rate to their penalty APR. The Citi Simplicity® Card never charges a penalty rate, so your APR isn't at risk of increasing due to late payments.<strong>No annual fee:</strong> This card comes with no annual fee, which is an important feature if your goal is to pay off debt.</p>\n    <p>With the quality benefits the card offers, it's primarily aimed at consumers who have a credit score of 670 or better. There are reports of people with scores in the mid 600s being approved for this card.

Your credit utilization is reported monthly, which means paying off debt could improve your credit score in one month!</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>If your priority is a long 0% intro APR for a balance transfer, the Citi Simplicity® Card clearly outshines the competition.

And they often are also subject to a cap and limited in what purchases they apply to. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is perfect for someone that wants an easy-to-use card that still offers high rewards: you’ll earn a best-in-class flat rewards right away on your purchases -- with no limits or hoops to jump through.</p>\n    <p><strong>$200 cash rewards welcome offer</strong> -- New Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card holders can earn a $200 cash rewards welcome offer for spending just $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. Not only is this a very competitive sign-up bonus for a card with no annual fee, but it's also one of the things that sets this Wells Fargo credit card apart from other 2% back cards. We’ve yet to come across another credit card with 2% unlimited cash rewards that also has a sign-up bonus.</p>\n    <p><strong>12 months from account opening 0% APR intro offer </strong>-- New cardholders can enjoy 0% intro APR on both new purchases and eligible balance transfers for a full 12 months from account opening. (After that period, a go-to rate of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies.) That's a great offer, even when compared to cards marketed just for a 0% intro APR. It means that this card will allow you to avoid interest on purchases and balance transfers for a full year!</p>\n    <p>Keep in mind that balance transfers need to be made within the first 120 days to qualify for a reduced interest rate and a lower balance transfer fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>No annual fee </strong>-- In many cases, high rewards rates mean high annual fees. Not with the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which sports a $0 annual fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>Cell phone protection</strong> -- With the price of a typical cell phone in the hundreds of dollars, having some sort of insurance is a good idea. With this Wells Fargo card, you can get built-in cell phone protection of up to $600 just by paying your cell phone bill with your card. Coverage is subject to a $25 deductible.</p>\n    <p>Approval for the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is most likely for applicants with good credit, which typically means a credit score of 670 or higher.

To be clear, we do not believe the UK economy is approaching a cliff edge,” Next’s half-year earnings report said.</p>\n    <p>“At best we expect anaemic growth, with progress constrained by four factors: declining job opportunities; new regulation that erodes competitiveness;, government spending commitments that are beyond its means; and a rising tax burden that undermines national productivity.”</p>\n    <p>Shares tumbled by 6% in early trading on Thursday, making Next the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the company announced it would hand a further £99m to it shareholders, via a dividend worth 87p per share. It followed a near-18% jump in half-year pre-tax profits to £509m, on a statutory basis, as sales in the six months to July rose by 10.3% to £3.3bn.</p>\n    <p>Next and Lord Wolfson have been strong critics of the government’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/17/worse-for-hospitality-than-covid-bosses-blame-reeves-budget-for-uk-downturn\"> employers’ national insurance contributions</a> during last year’s autumn budget.

It added that while it never used zero-hours contracts, the bill may curb “low-hour” contracts for many workers “depriving them of the ability to volunteer for extra hours of work when it suits them”.</p>\n    <p>Overall, the retailer said entry-level employees were facing the “triple pressure of rising costs, increasing regulation, and displacement through mechanisation and AI”.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said that Next was “clearly unimpressed by the current government’s performance”.</p>\n    <p>However, Next still “breezed past its original sales guidance over the first half, driven by favourable weather, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/25/marks-and-spencer-pauses-online-orders-cyber-attack-fallout\">major disruption at M&amp;S </a>and impressive international growth.

    "body": "<p>It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.</p>\n<p>But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.</p>\n<p>And once installed, it’s tough to remove.</p>\n<p>\n            While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo<strong> </strong>has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.\n    </p>\n<p>In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.</p>\n<p>Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.</p>\n<p>“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”</p>\n<p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.</p>\n<p>\n            Some American lawmakers are pushing for a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/tiktok-ban-national-security-hearing/index.html\">national ban</a> on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/tech/tiktok-ceo-hearing/index.html\">was grilled</a> by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/tech/temu-shopping-app-us-popularity-intl-hnk/index.html\">topping US download charts</a> and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.\n    </p>\n<p>While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.</p>\n<p>\n            There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/media/tiktok-ceo-congress-reliable-sources/index.html\">there are concerns</a> from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The findings follow <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">Google’s suspension</a> of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pinduoduo-app-malware-detailed-by-cybersecurity-researchers?sref=IIP4JEyu\">ensuing report</a> from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">previously rejected</a> “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”\n    </p>\n<p>CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.</p>\n<h2>Rise to success</h2>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and<strong> </strong>a market value three times that of eBay\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EBAY&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (EBAY)</a>, wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/tech/pinduoduo-colin-huang-intl-hnk/index.html\">Colin Huang</a>, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BABA&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (BABA)</a> and JD.com\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=JD&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (JD)</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.</p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo posted triple digit<a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\"> growth</a> in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/26/technology/pinduoduo-ipo-china-startup/index.html\">it listed</a> in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its <a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\">earnings reports</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.</p>\n<p>According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>\n<p>“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.</p>\n<p>By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.</p>\n<p>This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.</p>\n<p>The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.</p>\n<p>PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.</p>\n<h2>What experts found</h2>\n<p>Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.</p>\n<p>Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.</p>\n<p>The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.</p>\n<p>“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.</p>\n<p>The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.</p>\n<p>Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.</p>\n<p>“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.</p>\n<h2>Android targeted</h2>\n<p>\n            In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/tech/huawei-harmony-os/index.html\">Android system</a>. Apple\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (AAPL)</a>’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n    </p>\n<p>Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.</p>\n<p>CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.</p>\n<p>Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.</p>\n<p>Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.</p>\n<p>Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.</p>\n<p>Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.</p>\n<p>Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.</p>\n<p>They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.</p>\n<h2>Disbanding the team</h2>\n<p>\n            Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/P_EYQxOEupqdU0BJMRqWsw\">report</a> by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with <a href=\"https://github.com/davincifans101/pinduoduo_backdoor_detailed_report/blob/main/README.md\">their own reports</a> confirming the original findings.\n    </p>\n<p>Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.</p>\n<p>Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cnn.it/40OSomK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They weren't able to do it as a group today.\"</p>\n    <h2>Chelsea acknowledge weaknesses</h2>\n    <p>Harry Kane scores twice as Bayern Munich beat Chelsea 3-1</p>\n    <p>Maresca may have been broadly pleased with his team's performance, but accepted they lacked \"full focus for the full 95 minutes\".</p>\n    <p>He added: \"I think the players were already aware of this competition, of the difficulties.</p>\n    <p>\"You cannot commit mistakes in the way we have done, but I just said to the players, it's a game that we can learn a lot from, and build something special from this defeat.\"</p>\n    <p>Chelsea played well, especially early on when Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez missed good chances, but mistakes cost them.</p>\n    <p>They switched off at a drop-ball, leaving Bayern winger Michael Olise free to deliver a cross that Trevoh Chalobah turned into his own net. Then midfielder Moises Caicedo brought down Harry Kane to concede a penalty - which the England captain converted.</p>\n    <p>After Palmer had pulled a goal back, Kane sealed victory in the second half when defender Malo Gusto gave away the ball.</p>\n    <p>They were all defensive lapses against ruthless opposition. Bayern - a team who have won their first match in each of their past 22 Champions League campaigns - know the ropes at this level, in a way the current Chelsea side do not.</p>\n    <h2>Can Chelsea overcome their naivety?</h2>\n    <p>Nevin added on 5 Live: \"It wasn't quite men against boys, but Bayern Munich were certainly a good distance ahead of Chelsea here.</p>\n    <p>\"The mistakes Chelsea made were quite naive and they were caught out, not just for the goals, but for a whole raft of chances aside from that. That's what happens with young players playing in this competition, but they will learn from that.</p>\n    <p>\"This level is elite. It is a jump. And that jump may take them a little while.\"</p>\n    <p>Inexperience may well have been an issue: In Munich, Chelsea fielded their third-youngest ever Champions League team.</p>\n    <p>Their entire 24-man squad went into Wednesday's match with just 117 appearances in the competition between them. By contrast, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, 39, has played 131 times in the Champions League for Bayern Munich alone.</p>\n    <p>His team-mates Kane, Joshua Kimmich and Serge Gnabry have substantial experience at this level. By contrast, Chelsea pair Caicedo and Marc Cucurella were making their debuts in the competition despite being among the team's star names.</p>\n    <p>Even head coach Maresca, part of Pep Guardiola's staff during Manchester City's 2023 Treble-winning campaign, may need to step up to this level.</p>\n    <p>It felt as if a third Bayern goal was coming for a few minutes before Kane scored it - but Maresca seemed slow to react, and only made changes after his team had gone 3-1 down.</p>\n    <p>It was too little, all too late.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c62ld0pedd8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Watch Trump arrive in New York for his arraignment</p>\n<p>01:18</p>\n<p>What we covered here</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p>Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”</p>\n<p>In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.</p>\n<p>However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.</p>\n<p>The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.</p>\n<p>The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategy</p>\n<p>From CNN's Jeff Zeleny</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.</p>\n<p>But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump, gives an interview outside of Trump Tower on March 21 in New York City.</p>\n<p>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”</p>\n<p>On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.”</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>The former president met with attorneys at Trump Tower on the eve of his arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Kristen Holmes</p>\n<p>From left to right: Susan Necheles, Todd Blanche and Joe Tacopina.</p>\n<p>(Reuters/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>Trump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Photos: Trump arrives in New York City a day before his expected arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Photo Desk</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has landed in New York’s La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse.</p>\n<p>History was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“She clearly has to fix the problem. I think it’s one thing to come back twice. We don’t want to be here a third time.” Bluntness served Ruth Curtice well in her past life as a senior Treasury official. These days, she deploys it publicly, as chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/resolution-foundation\">Resolution Foundation</a> – urging Rachel Reeves to think the unthinkable before November’s crunch budget.</p>\n    <p>In the course of half an hour’s conversation in her bright white Westminster office, Curtice says the chancellor must be ready to ditch Labour’s manifesto tax pledges, scrap the pensions triple lock, lift the two-child limit on benefits – and forget the idea that a new wealth tax is the answer to anything.</p>\n    <p>As a longtime civil servant, Curtice, 41, served nine different chancellors and rose to be the Treasury’s director of fiscal policy, before crossing St James’s Park earlier this year to run arguably the UK’s most influential thinktank.</p>\n    <p>She emphasises its non-partisan nature, and impact on past policies, including George Osborne’s “national living wage” – but there is no denying its intimate links to the current Labour regime.</p>\n    <p>Curtice’s predecessor, Torsten Bell, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/20/investment-uk-crumbling-public-services-pro-growth-torsten-bell\">the pensions minister</a>, recently handed an important role in thrashing out plans for the budget. The newbie Treasury minister Dan Tomlinson is a former Resolution Foundation economist. Richard Hughes passed through en route from the Treasury to the highly influential post of director of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Keir Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/29/starmer-names-former-bank-of-england-deputy-governor-as-his-chief-economic-adviser\">new economic adviser</a>, Minouche Shafik, co-chaired the thinktank’s weighty Economy 2030 commission. The appointments have prompted accusations that a “leftwing cabal” has taken over the Treasury.</p>\n    <p>Curtice says the thinktank has “no affiliation” with Labour, and that, of the seven Conservative chancellors she worked with, “lots of them care about exactly the group that Resolution care about”.</p>\n    <p>Of her emergence from the anonymity of the Treasury into public life, Curtice says: “I’ve enjoyed it, actually, more than I thought I would. And, you know, it’s nice to be allowed to say what you think.”</p>\n    <p>Her father is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/14/elections-guru-john-curtice-exit-polls\">the legendary polling expert Sir John Curtice</a> – a much-loved fixture of TV elections coverage.</p>\n    <p>She says he gave her a love of politics, without the partisanship that can dominate discussion in Westminster. “I feel quite lucky to have grown up in a household where politics was everywhere, but political loyalty was nowhere,” she says. “I guess that’s why Resolution chimes with me and why I feel quite strongly about it.”</p>\n    <p>When it came to specifics, though, he was less useful. When she showed him a politics-related question she was struggling with during her Scottish highers – the equivalent of A-levels – “he just told me the question was wrong and it was no help at all”.</p>\n    <p>She clearly feels many politicians are also asking the wrong questions in the run-up to November’s budget. “The debate just does feel kind of unrealistic,” she says. “Taxes are going up because the government chose to fund the NHS. That’s the trade-off.”</p>\n    <p>Reeves used last year’s budget to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">announce a £40bn package of tax rises</a>, much of which was set aside for spending on healthcare after an election campaign in which tales of hard-to-reach GPs and ambulance queues featured heavily.</p>\n    <p>But the narrow margin of error the chancellor left herself means that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">an expected forecast downgrade from the OBR</a> is likely to force her to come back for more in November, if she wants to meet her fiscal rules.</p>\n    <p>Curtice is calling on the chancellor to decisively increase the £9.9bn headroom against her fiscal rules, to avoid the risk of constant destabilising speculation about future tax rises. If necessary, she says, Reeves should consider busting Labour’s manifesto promises to do so.</p>\n    <p>“If she could increase her margin for error against her fiscal rules, that would be a good thing. That’s difficult to achieve, but she probably wouldn’t regret it in a year’s time.”</p>\n    <p>Labour promised before last year’s general election not to increase taxes on “working people”, including national insurance, VAT or income tax, and Reeves has recently reiterated that pledge.</p>\n    <p>But, Curtice points out, “the taxes covered by the manifesto are about 75% of the tax base. It would be better to think about those than to do things that are economically damaging, and in the end, that might be the way to go.”</p>\n    <p>She added: “Broad-based tax rises should be on the table if that’s what’s needed to fix the picture.” The CBI chief executive, Rain Newton-Smith, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/cbi-boss-calls-for-rachel-reeves-to-tear-up-labours-manifesto-pledge-on-tax\">made a similar argument recently</a>.</p>\n    <p>Curtice rejects the idea, popular on Labour’s left, that a new wealth tax, levied as a percentage of the total value of a person’s assets, is a feasible way of raising significant new revenue.</p>\n    <p>Instead, she advocates reforming the capital gains tax system to move it more in line with income tax – so unearned income is not treated more generously by HMRC than workers’ wages. “We do tax wealth: we tax it through capital gains tax and inheritance tax. Let’s do that better,” she said, adding: “It’s just more likely to work, certainly in the short term, than inventing a new tax.”</p>\n    <p>The Resolution Foundation, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, is funded by its founder and chair, the insurance tycoon Clive Cowdery – to the tune of £2.5m last year. Instead of the cramped quarters endured by some Westminster thinktanks, it occupies part of a smart townhouse, decked out with chrome and black marble.</p>\n    <p>Its brief is to advance the living standards of low- and middle-income workers – an aim that has become only more pressing over its two decades of existence.</p>\n    <p>In research published to coincide with the anniversary, the thinktank finds that, had living standards continued to increase over the past 20 years at the same pace of the previous decade – 1995-2005 – typical yearly family incomes would be an extraordinary £20,000 higher.</p>\n    <p>Curtice is keen to point out that this has not been a story of the rich racing away from the rest, but of real incomes stagnating across the entire economy.</p>\n    <p>“Truthfully, the challenge of the last 20 years is not rising inequality. We have, as promised, all been in this together. It’s been terrible for rich and for poor,” she says.</p>\n    <p>“Now, it’s harder for poor households to bear and they have had the worst time, so we mustn’t forget they’re the only group where living standards have actually fallen through this period. We know that child poverty has risen and is projected to continue to rise. But the stagnation in living standards is very broad-based.”</p>\n    <p>One group that has done relatively well, however, is pensioners – and like Bell before he crossed the line into politics, she is clear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\">the triple lock</a>, which increases the state pension in line with the highest of earnings, inflation or 2.5%, should go.</p>\n    <p>“Living standards over the last 20 years for non-pensioners have grown about 7%, [and] for pensioners have grown about 21%,” she says. “Resolution has long said that it would be better to peg pensions to average earnings rather than having this ratchet.”</p>\n    <p>Bell recently ruled the triple lock out of scope for a new pensions commission, set up to report to the government on how to improve retirement provision in the UK. But Curtice says: “I would find it hard to sit on the pensions commission and not talk about it.”</p>\n    <p>She saves some of her bluntest language for the challenge of tackling rising child poverty, with the government yet to set out a detailed strategy on how it will achieve this manifesto promise.</p>\n    <p>Like many Labour MPs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/lucy-powell-hits-out-at-sexist-talk-that-she-is-labour-proxy-for-andy-burnham\">including the deputy leadership challenger Lucy Powell</a>, Curtice says there is a straightforward answer to this: scrap the two-child limit that means families are not entitled to child tax credit or universal credit for third and subsequent children – <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/limited-ambition/\">a change that would cost £3.5bn a year</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Lifting the two-child cap is a rare example in public policy of an extremely well-targeted measure. On our projections, child poverty reaches record highs by the end of this parliament.</p>\n    <p>“Children in large families, half of them will be in poverty. Our job is to produce remarkable statistics, but that one still slightly takes my breath away.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/18/resolution-foundation-ruth-curtice-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-two-child-limit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But just like anybody who is juggling a career and a family life as well, when your family is under attack, it wears on you. And he's not immune from that because he's the president of a country,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Mr Clare said there would be \"expert testimony that will come out that will be scientific in nature\" and while he would not reveal, at this stage, its exact nature, he said the couple were prepared to demonstrate fully \"both generically and specifically\" that the allegations are false.</p>\n    <p>\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"It is a process that she will have to subject herself to in a very public way. But she's willing to do it. She is firmly resolved to do what it takes to set the record straight.</p>\n    <p>\"If that unpleasantness and that discomfort that she has of opening herself up in that way is what it takes to set a record straight and stop this, she's 100% ready to meet that burden.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a78c/live/8ecd51e0-93f0-11f0-8750-ed240c52ff67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Macrons' lawyer Tom Clare, a white man with grey hair, stubble and wearing a white shirt and red tie \"/>\n    <p>When asked if the Macrons would be supplying pictures of Brigitte pregnant and raising her children, Mr Clare said they existed and would be presented in court where there are rules and standards.</p>\n    <p>Ms Owens, a former commentator for conservative US outlet Daily Wire who has millions of followers on social media, has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man.</p>\n    <p>In March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.</p>\n    <p>The allegation originated in fringe online spaces years earlier, notably through a 2021 YouTube video by French bloggers Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey.</p>\n    <p>The Macrons initially won a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey in 2024, but that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2025 on freedom of expression grounds, not on the basis of truth. The Macrons are appealing the decision.</p>\n    <p>In July, the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Ms Owens in the US. It alleges she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".</p>\n    <p>In American defamation cases against public figures, plaintiffs are required to prove \"actual malice\" - that the defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e781/live/04483d90-93f1-11f0-8750-ed240c52ff67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Candace Owens Right-wing US influencer Candace Owens, a black woman wearing earrings and looking at the camera\"/>\n    <p>In August, Emmanuel Macron explained to French magazine, Paris Match, why they had chosen to pursue legal action.</p>\n    <p>\"This is about defending my honour! Because this is nonsense. This is someone who knew full well that she had false information and did so with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\"</p>\n    <p>Ms Owens' lawyers have responded to the Macrons' lawsuit with a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case should not have been filed in Delaware, as she says it does not relate to her businesses, which are incorporated in the state. They claim forcing her to defend the case in Delaware would cause \"substantial financial and operational hardship\".</p>\n    <p>The BBC has approached Candace Owens' legal team for a comment.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>It has been a brutal week in America and I'm not the only one wondering whether the country can pull itself out of this spiral of hatred and violence.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>After one of the most searing assassinations in US history, the governor of Utah pleaded for Americans to turn down the political temperature.</p>\n<p>But hardly anyone that I've spoken to since Charlie Kirk's death thinks that will be the path the country will choose. Not anytime soon, at least.</p>\n<p>Recent history is full of examples where America has chosen not to come together after a tragedy. It didn't happen 14 years ago after a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12143774\">Democratic congresswoman was shot in the head</a> in Arizona. Nor eight years ago, when a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-40278024\">Republican congressman was shot during baseball practice.</a></p>\n<p>Americans didn't even come together in the face of a global pandemic. In fact, Covid made divisions worse.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple, yet hard to change. The incentives that fuel American political life reward the people and platforms that turn up the heat, not those who dial tensions down.</p>\n<p>Around the country, you're more likely to get elected to political office if you run on policies and rhetoric that appeal to your political base, rather than the political middle (it's the depressing byproduct of gerrymandering - the original sin behind America's dysfunctional, divided politics).</p>\n<p>Equally, in the media, people who opine about politics are rewarded for being more extreme and stoking outrage — that's the way to get more eyeballs and, ultimately, more advertising dollars.</p>\n<p>This incentive structure is what makes Utah Governor Spencer Cox something of an American exception.</p>\n<p>After Charlie Kirk was killed, he urged Americans to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in the community\".</p>\n<p>He sounded so sane, so wholesome - an effort, in a sea of division, at reconciliation.</p>\n<h2>The 1960s and 70s versus today</h2>\n<p>Division and political violence are not new phenomena in America. Some 160 years ago, the country went to war with itself and it has never really stopped.</p>\n<p>Over a period of five years in the 1960s, a US president was killed and then his brother was killed while campaigning to become president. In that same period, two of the nation's most prominent civil rights leaders were assassinated too.</p>\n<p>In the 1970s, President Gerald Ford was shot at on two separate occasions. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was struck by a bullet while walking to his limousine.</p>\n<p>And of course, just last year Trump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in Pennsylvania — and a second alleged attempt by a gunman in Florida, whose trial began the week Kirk was killed.</p>\n<p>What makes this era so different from the 1960s and 70s, though, is what Governor Cox is worried about.</p>\n<p>While he has carefully steered away from saying things that would further divide Americans, he hasn't been so gentle with the social media companies that he clearly blames for this tragedy.</p>\n<p>\"I believe that social media has played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years,\" Cox said in an interview on Sunday.</p>\n<p>He went on to say that \"cancer\" was likely too weak a word for what it has done to American society.</p>\n<p>Most tech companies have stayed quiet in their official capacities. However, Elon Musk, billionaire boss of X, has weighed in, claiming that the \"radical left celebrated the cold-blooded murder of Charlie Kirk,\" and adding, \"unity is impossible with evil fanatics who celebrate murder\".</p>\n<p>He has also posted about the impact of social media, arguing: \"While at times the discussion on X can become negative, it's still good that there is a discussion happening.\"</p>\n<h2>'This is like a bad marriage'</h2>\n<p>The pitfalls of this system that blends social media with politics concerns even those who are the most passionate about politics, regardless of who they support.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Kaitlin Griffiths, a 19-year-old who is the president of Utah State University's chapter of Charlie Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, put it plainly: \"Social media is definitely a really difficult thing for our society.</p>\n<p>\"You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs — and I just think that's honestly tragic.\"</p>\n<p>Tragic and ironic, since Kirk saw himself as a champion of free speech, even as his critics often disagreed with that framing. His death though may push the country further from civil discourse.</p>\n<p>Within days of Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narratives.</p>\n<p>Many on the left are eager to explore the ways that Kirk's killer might have been radicalised by internet subcultures and group chats. Many on the right prefer to unpack whether the suspect was part of a left-wing conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Neither group seems particularly keen to prioritise reconciliation or healing.</p>\n<p>The reality is that those who study extremism believe that left-right may not even be the most helpful way to look at the division of this current moment.</p>\n<p>\"It's better to look at what's causing people to be ungovernable,\" says Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who specialises in polarised democracies.</p>\n<p>\"It does take a desire to turn down the temperature… [and] requires people to have a little more courage than they're showing.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is more useful to focus on how we as a society turn a page and open a new chapter, because this is like a bad marriage. And like a bad marriage, you can only lose by pointing fingers.\"</p>\n<h2>What reconciliation would take</h2>\n<p>As for the question of whether America can break the hold of the algorithms that stoke the divisions, that would take a leader of enormous strength with an equally enormous commitment to reconciliation.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not sure how we pull out of this,\" the politics writer David Drucker told me. \"It would help if both parties - and by parties I mean 'parties' not just political figures - agree to stop the recriminations and just say 'stop'.\"</p>\n<p>\"Usually only a president can facilitate that. Absent both sides agreeing there are certain lines that shouldn't be crossed, or absent the next president doing so, I'm not sure how we get there.\"</p>\n<p>Trump is not that type of president. He often seems at his strongest, politically, when he has an adversary to fight against.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that Trump does believe that people on the left want to destroy his Maga movement. And since Kirk's death, he has taken a very different tone from the governor of Utah.</p>\n<p>\"I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less,\" he said, when asked how the nation can be fixed. \"The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem.\"</p>\n<p>And he went further in his Oval Office remarks following Kirk's killing: \"Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\"</p>\n<p>The framing by the president - that this was not just the deed of a twisted individual but of the radical left more broadly - is being echoed by other White House officials.</p>\n<p>\"With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have... to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,\" said Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff.</p>\n<p>\"It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c04qenww53pt\">However, a number of studies</a> into politically-motivated killings and violence in the US - over several decades - suggest that more cases were carried out by people with \"right-wing\" ideologies than with \"left-wing\" ones, though more data is likely necessary to draw a firm conclusion.</p>\n<h2>'People say history repeats itself - it never has'</h2>\n<p>Some people I've spoken to point to bleak times in US history as a source of comfort.</p>\n<p>\"Few periods in America have been more politically bleak or violent than the years [in the 1960s and early 1970s] shaped by Vietnam and Watergate,\" former Republican congressman, turned influential TV host, Joe Scarborough told me.</p>\n<p>\"But the country moved forward, celebrated its bicentennial, and moved beyond its violent divides. It will do so again.\"</p>\n<p>Also among the optimists I spoke to was Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the country's most senior black officials. He condemned political violence as the most \"anti-democratic\" act, but also reminded me of the progress America has made on issues like race.</p>\n<p>\"The story of any family is always more complicated than the stories we tell ourselves at the family reunion,\" he told me.</p>\n<p>\"My father had to give up his seat [on a bus] while wearing his soldier's uniform to a teenager, but I now sit in a Senate seat.\"</p>\n<p>Their hope is heartening - but I still don't see a clear path out.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78n0e83ye0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>What was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?</h1>\n    <p>The state banquet is the spectacular showstopper of a state visit, a glittering feast with speeches, royal toasts, trumpet fanfares and fancy food and wine.</p>\n    <p>It's diplomacy served up with fine dining. A cut-glass shock-and-awe approach to hospitality designed to make a visiting leader like President Trump feel special.</p>\n    <p>The setting in St George's Hall inside Windsor Castle is a remarkable sight, a mix of medieval banquet and Harry Potter film.</p>\n    <p>Elaborately uniformed staff around the hall are as drilled as the soldiers who have been on parade during the day. The table settings, five glasses per person, are terrifyingly neat.</p>\n    <p>For Trump's visit, the 160 guests, sitting behind 1,452 pieces of cutlery, were eating from a menu, written in French, which translates as:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hampshire Watercress Panna Cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad</li>\n      <li>Organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savoury infused jus</li>\n      <li>Vanilla ice cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached Victoria plums</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Guests had a generous wine list.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wiston Estate, Cuvée, 2016</li>\n      <li>Domaine Bonneau de Martray, Corton-Charlemagne, Grand Cru, 2018</li>\n      <li>Ridge Vineyards, Monte Bello, 2000</li>\n      <li>Pol Roger, Extra Cuvée de Réserve, 1998</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>After-dinner drinks were drowning in symbolism. It's a 1945 vintage port, in honour of Trump having been the 45th US president, although he does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    <p>There was a 1912 cognac, from the birth year of the president's Scottish-born mother.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/766c/live/3adc1640-93f8-11f0-8750-ed240c52ff67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media A place settings at the banquet table reads THE KING and has gold cutlery next to it\"/>\n    <p>If that doesn't seem enough there was a special cocktail, the Transatlantic Whisky Sour, which blends Johnnie Walker with the bright citrus of marmalade, with pecan foam and a toasted marshmallow on a biscuit.</p>\n    <h2>Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook</h2>\n    <p>President Trump's banquet in Windsor Castle was conspicuously missing celebrity faces or screen stars. Were there people in Hollywood, or even west London, who suddenly found they had to be somewhere else tonight?</p>\n    <p>There's not even a hardy royal perennial like Sir David Beckham or Sir Elton John.</p>\n    <p>Instead the guest list was heavy on political operators and tech bros. Apple boss <strong>Tim Cook</strong> was there, sitting next to the president's daughter, <strong>Tiffany Trump</strong>.</p>\n    <p>Press baron <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> was sitting next to Sir Keir Starmer's key adviser <strong>Morgan McSweeney</strong>. The small talk must be interesting when Trump is suing the Murdoch press for billions in the US.</p>\n    <p>Like at a wedding, guests must be checking the nameplates around the ornately-decorated table to see who they're sitting beside.</p>\n    <p>The \"head\" of the table is in the middle for the Windsor state banquet, with the King and president in the centre of a dining table that is 47m long.</p>\n    <p>President Trump, as the guest of honour, was placed between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales.</p>\n    <p>The nameplate for Trump said \"President of the United States of America\", although in capital letters, oddly reminiscent of his social media messages.</p>\n    <p>Facing them is the first lady, whose nameplate says \"Mrs Trump\", with Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales on either side of her.</p>\n    <p>The seating arrangement threw up some interesting groupings. There was the <strong>US ambassador</strong> <strong>Warren Stephens</strong> flanked by <strong>Princess Anne</strong> on one side and <strong>Chancellor Rachel Reeves</strong> on the other.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> was beside <strong>Stephen Schwarzman, </strong>mega-wealthy CEO of the Blackstone investment group. If Conservative leader <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> was searching for ideas, she was sitting next to <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, chief executive of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI.</p>\n    <p>The US Secretary of State <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> was there and Trump's special envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong>. Among UK politicians Foreign Secretary <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> and Deputy Prime Minister <strong>David Lammy</strong> were there.</p>\n    <p>Golfer <strong>Nick Faldo</strong> and athlete <strong>Dame Katherine Grainger</strong> were among the more prominent sports stars at the banquet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jensen Huang, </strong>chief executive<strong> </strong>of Nvidia, was one of the tech contingent.</p>\n    <p>On the walls are royal portraits and suits of armour and the ceiling is studded with the coats of arms of Knights of the Garter.</p>\n    <p>St George's Hall was rebuilt after the fire of 1992. So perhaps like many stories about the royals, it feels new and old at the same time.</p>\n    <p>According to the travelling US press pack, the choice of music at the banquet reflected some of President Trump's favourites. Maybe they have their own messages to the politicians listening.</p>\n    <p>It includes Nessun Dorma, meaning \"none shall sleep\" and You Can't Always Get What You Want.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef34/live/a99f61b0-109d-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, purple banner promoting the Royal Watch newsletter with text saying, “Insider stories and expert analysis in your inbox every week”.

Representatives for Kimmel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n    <p>Kimmel said on Monday: \"The Maga Gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n    <p>The late-night host also criticised flags being flown at half mast in honour of Kirk, and mocked the president's reaction to the shooting.</p>\n    <p>\"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a gold fish,\" Kimmel said.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after ABC announced the host had been suspended, Trump, who has criticised him on multiple occasions, said it was \"great news for America\".</p>\n    <p>\"The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\"the president wrote in a social media post.</p>\n    <p>Trump then criticised two other late-night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and and Seth Myers, who he described as \"two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, said on a podcast that Kimmel's remarks showed \"the sickest conduct possible\" as he urged Disney to take action.</p>\n    <p>\"[Broadcasters] have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,\" said Carr, who is a Trump-appointee.</p>\n    <p>\"Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead,\" Carr told The Benny Show.</p>\n    <p>He noted that an apology from Kimmel would be a \"very reasonable, minimal step\".</p>\n    <p>The ABC announcement came just after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar Media, said it would not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show\".</p>\n    <p>Nexstar said the comedian's remarks about Kirk \"are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse\".</p>\n    <p>\"[We] do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division.</p>\n    <p>\"Continuing to give Mr Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to pre-empt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.\"</p>\n    <p>Following the programme's suspension, Carr thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead.</p>\n    <p>Authorities have not specified a motive in Kirk's fatal shooting on 10 September. Tyler Robinson has been charged over the killing and is facing the death penalty if convicted at trial.</p>\n    <p>Charging documents said the suspect's mother \"explained that over the last year or so, Robinson had become political and started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented\".</p>\n    <p>The court papers say that when the suspect's parents asked him why he had targeted Kirk, he told them the conservative activist \"spreads too much hate\".</p>\n    <p>Robinson was not registered to any political party and did not vote in the 2022 or 2024 elections. He was not old enough to vote in the 2020 election.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While companies like Huawei and Alibaba design AI chips locally, Nvidia is by far the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html\">global market leader</a>, and its chips are considered to be some of the most advanced on the market.</p><p>When asked for comment, Nvidia provided the following statement from CEO Jensen Huang at a press conference on Wednesday: “We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Huang said. “I’m disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I’m patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.”</p><p>The Trump administration hit semiconductor companies, including Nvidia, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/\">licensing requirements</a> to sell their AI chips in China in April. </p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

But according to Gene Berdichevsky, co-founder and CEO of battery materials manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.silanano.com\">Sila</a>, the real breakthrough might lurk elsewhere inside the aluminum and glass enclosure.</p><p>“The battery in the new iPhone is pretty remarkable,” Berdichevsky told TechCrunch. “The completely arbitrary, two-dimensional shape — you look at the shape, and it’s pretty amazing.”</p><p>“I just got back from Asia and, and I got a chance to see some of these cells,” he added. “It’s a revolutionary piece of battery tech.”</p><p>Berdichevsky <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/17/silas-gene-berdichevsky-on-the-5-year-roller-coaster-facing-battery-companies/\">knows a thing or two</a> about batteries. As Tesla’s seventh employee, he led engineering on the original Roadster’s battery, which became the template for subsequent Teslas. Today, he leads Sila, which is producing silicon anode materials for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sila-nanotechnologiess-first-next-gen-battery-will-launch-in-whoop-wearables/\">consumer electronics</a> and, soon, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/17/electric-mercedes-g-class-will-go-the-distance-with-silas-energy-dense-silicon-anodes/\">electric vehicles</a>.</p><p>The iPhone Air’s notched design is made possible by a technology Apple has <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210074958A1/en\">patented</a> called a metal can battery. The key detail is in the name: a metal casing that surrounds the entire cell, adding strength and physical durability. Most batteries used in consumer electronics are pouch cells, which have a soft plastic casing that’s cheap to manufacture and allows for some degree of swelling.</p><p>Apple has used L-shaped batteries in iPhones for years. All lithium ion batteries swell to some degree, and the interior corner of the L becomes a pinch points when that swelling occurs.</p><p>“Those are very finicky, and this basically makes it bulletproof. You can now build batteries in any two-dimensional shape you want,” Berdichevsky said.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

It allows the battery to worm its way into whatever space is free after the various circuit boards have been positioned.</p><p>Ultimately, Berdichevsky thinks that most phones will adopt metal can batteries despite their added expense. The extra energy storage will be worth it.</p><p>It will also be “very key” for smaller devices like AR and VR glasses, he said, adding that he saw a few prototypes while he was in China. “It’s even more of an energy density improvement because it lets you fit into weird shapes,” Berdichevsky said.</p><p>The switch to such a complex battery is likely why Apple hasn’t swapped carbon anodes in its lithium ion batteries for silicon-heavy versions, also known as silicon-carbon.</p><p>“If you’re bringing [a new battery design] online, you kind of go, ‘You know what? Let’s use yesterday’s chemistry,’” Berdichevsky said.</p><p>But the transition to metal can construction could facilitate the move to silicon anodes in the near future. Pure silicon anodes can store around 50% more energy than traditional graphite anodes, but the material is prone to swelling. Companies like Sila have developed proprietary ways to manage that swelling within the material, but it still needs to be accounted for at the cell level.</p><p>“It definitely will help introduce silicon in these kind of devices,” Berdichevsky said. “It lets us push the performance limits more. We’ve always had these trade offs, and we have to manage the swell. You still have to do that, but you can push it a little bit more. It’s pretty revolutionary.”</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/the-iphone-airs-real-breakthrough-is-its-battery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.</p>\n<p>For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place.</p>\n<p>That’s a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/itunes-ping/\">music social network Ping</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/so-long-to-apples-music-social-network-ping-we-hardly-knew-ye/\">which closed down</a> in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139837/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued\">also didn’t last</a>.)</p>\n<p>Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/spotify-is-no-longer-just-a-streaming-app-its-a-social-network/\">more social app</a> with additions like its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/spotify-revamps-its-app-with-tiktok-style-discovery-feeds-smart-shuffle-for-playlists-and-more/\">TikTok-inspired feeds</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/chasing-youtube-spotify-adds-comments-to-podcasts/\">comments</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/spotify-rolls-out-podcast-polls-and-qas-to-creators-and-users-worldwide/\">polls, and Q&amp;As</a> for podcasts, artist <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/spotify-introduces-countdown-pages-and-its-own-stories-feature/\">stories</a>, collaborative playlists, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/spotify-launches-a-messages-feature-in-a-bid-to-become-more-social/\">messaging feature,</a> and more. </p>\n<p>Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillespoupardin/\">Gilles Poupardin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gawenarab/\">Gawen Arab</a>, they’ve had time to iterate on their ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbuds</p>\n<p>Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/whyd-announces-its-voice-controlled-connected-speaker-for-299/\">voice-controlled smart speaker</a> (arriving just ahead of Amazon’s Echo debut), and a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/cappuccino-lets-you-share-short-intimate-audio-stories-with-your-friends/\">social audio app called Cappuccino</a> that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snapchat-buys-zenly/\">sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017</a>.</p>\n<p>After the Cappuccio team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds.</p>\n<p>“Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it’s a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming.</p>\n<p>“Basically, it’s effortless. You just connect your Spotify, and then every time you’re going to listen to something on Spotify, it’s going to be shared on Airbuds in real time,” he says.</p>\n<p>Today, Airbuds supports Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Musi, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Audiomack.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbuds</p>\n<p>While Airbuds’ core functionality remains the widget, the app has built on top of that experience to offer a range of other social features.</p>\n<p>Users can react to their friends’ streamed songs with emojis, stickers, or selfies clipped out from photos with the background removed. As users scroll the app’s feed, they can play clips of their friends’ streamed songs and even chat with a friend through a simple, built-in messenger. When you want to stream your music but not share it, there’s a “ghost mode” option to keep your listening private until it’s disabled.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbuds</p>\n<p>Airbuds will also display friends with similar music tastes and deliver a personalized Weekly Recap of what you streamed, like a miniature version of Spotify’s popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it’s experimenting with a new feature that would let users join their school on the app to see the music top artists from their schoolmates.</p>\n<p>Users can also customize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite artists, songs, albums, lyrics, pictures, text, and more, or let the app automatically design it for them.</p>\n<p>This self-expression feature is key to the app’s traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app’s features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming.</p>\n<p>The streamers, he said, “gave us access to 100 million songs, but nobody really cracked the identity piece, the self-expression piece…and this is exactly how they use it,” referring to Airbuds’ young users, who are mostly high schoolers and college students in the U.S. (The app also has some traction in the U.K., Australia, Brazil, and Mexico.)</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Airbuds</p>\n<p>However, some of Airbuds’ traction can be chalked up to its feature-gating, which requires users to invite friends to gain access to some of the app’s functionality. For example, you have to invite friends to see more than your top 3 artists in the recap. But Poupardin stresses it’s not just for growth — the app only really works if you add your friends.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/airbuds-is-the-music-social-network-apple-and-spotify-wish-they-had-built/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The company is updating Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, to help handle tasks on the seller’s behalf. </p><p>“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/seller-assistant-agentic-ai\">press release</a>. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.”</p><p>Seller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says.</p><p>For example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations.</p><p>Seller Assistant continuously monitors a seller’s account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Additionally, it can automatically ensure that all of a seller’s products meet compliance requirements in every country they’re selling in.</p><p>Agent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients. On Tuesday, Google released <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">a new payments protocol for agentic transactions</a>, although Amazon was not named as a partner.</p><p>Amazon also announced that it’s bringing agentic AI to advertising, allowing sellers to develop ads through conversational prompts.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n    <p>LegalZoom is one of those online legal services that in most cases can handle basic legal tasks for you. I recently tried it out to make an LLC for my cosmic country band, Steel Fringe (shameless plug), and it appears to have worked just fine (we’re still waiting on a full evaluation from legal experts for a future guide to these services). If you use a LegalZoom promo code right now, you will get a discount on the service.</p>\n    <p>I found it super easy to set up my LLC, and after about $500 and 30 minutes of my time, I was off to the races with an LLC for my band. I did make the mistake of spelling my co-bandleader’s middle name as his last name (I blame his wrongly named Instagram handle for this), so I had to toss them another $129 to fix that. My bad.</p>\n    <p>Save on top services at LegalZoom, like LLC registration, incorporation, estate plans, and more with coupons and deals from WIRED below.</p>\n    <h2>Get 10% Off LLC Formation With Our LegalZoom Coupon Code</h2>\n    <p>If you’re in need of basic legal services like establishing an LLC, estate planning, or other contract-based services, LegalZoom offers a very simple interface that is shockingly easy to use. I am a luddite when it comes to understanding legal jargon and steps in a process like establishing my band’s LLC, but LegalZoom’s simple interface made it shockingly easy to make sure everything was in order.</p>\n    <p>If you use our exclusive code for 10% off <a href=\"https://www.legalzoom.com/business/business-formation/llc-overview.html\">LLC Formations</a> (found in the table above), you’ll get a nice chunk of change off the cost of setting up your small business. As you’ll read below, it’s not especially cheap to do this, even digitally, in many states. There are mandatory filing fees and other fees that can range from a few hundred to many hundreds of dollars. Take the discount!</p>\n    <h2>How Much Does It Cost to Set Up An LLC on LegalZoom?</h2>\n    <p>The cost to properly <a href=\"https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-much-does-an-llc-cost\">set up an LLC</a> in your state can range from $35 to $500, depending on various factors like local legislation and business registration laws. Most states charge between $50 and $200 for filing fees, so you can expect to pay somewhere in that range unless you’re from Montana ($35) or Massachusetts ($500). LegalZoom also shoves a bunch of options you probably don’t need in your face, so be sure to Google what you actually need in your state before paying extra money to … print all your documents and put them in a folder for you, or other such nonsense.</p>\n    <h2>Make the Most of LegalZoom With Free Resources</h2>\n    <p>Once you have your membership, you can take advantage of the bevy of <a href=\"https://www.legalzoom.com/articles\">helpful content</a> LegalZoom provides to make sure you're getting the most out of the money you’ve invested in the service. These articles are especially great resources that provide information about top of mind questions, like “What is a Durable Power of Attorney, and How does it Work?” and Should I Trademark My Business Name?</p>\n    <h2>Other Ways to Save at LegalZoom (Even Without a Coupon)</h2>\n    <p>If you’re looking for a good deal on other services, LegalZoom frequently offers seasonal promotions, and nearly always celebrates Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the New Year with discounts for legal eagles.</p>\n    <p>If you have many or ongoing needs, you can choose an annual plan with LegalZoom where it will do all of your required legal filings, often offering lower monthly rates than paying month to month. There are also installment plan options for products priced at $200 or more, if you really need something done but can’t quite afford it right now.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/legalzoom-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Logitech G Pro X2 Superstrike lets you adjust the mouse click's actuation point or enable rapid trigger, just like you can on a Hall effect or optical keyboard. The X2 Superstrike doesn't use either of these technologies, however, rather a \"bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS).\"</p>\n    <p>In addition to controller triggers and joysticks, Hall effect and other analogue magnetic technologies have come to some of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-keyboard/\">best gaming keyboards</a>, but we hadn't yet seen it in a gaming mouse. That's probably in part because feeling a click at the point of mouse button actuation is so important for feel.</p>\n    <p>One of the benefits of analogue technologies like Hall effect is that they let you have your switch press actuate at points other than a specific point where there's a mechanical 'click', but that's made it difficult to implement on a mouse because with a mouse you <i>want </i>that click at the point of actuation.</p>\n    <p>This is what Logitech is claiming to have solved thanks to its \"Superstrike\" technology which is a \"combination of inductive analogue sensing and real-time click haptics.\" This means you can have the physical feedback of a mouse click at any set actuation point. Logitech says \"it doesn't feel exactly like a standard microswitch but it does feel like clicking a mouse.\" It's \"nearly silent\", and you can adjust the intensity of the haptic feedback you feel according to five levels.</p>\n    <p>Induction is a newer arrival to PC gaming peripherals, but it looks very promising—Cherry, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/cherry-proclaims-a-new-era-for-keyboard-switches-induction-is-half-the-cost-of-a-regular-mechanical-switch-more-reliable-and-less-power-hungry-than-analog-alternatives/\">reckons it's cheaper and more reliable and flexible</a> than other options.</p>\n    <p>Merits of the particular technology aside, induction is an analogue technology that comes with the same benefits as the others. Primarily, you can adjust the actuation level to where you want it—lower, for a faster click, for instance—and enable rapid trigger which will let you re-actuate your mouse click the moment you let up on the previous click.</p>\n    <p>Logitech says the Superstrike has \"ten levels of actuation and five rapid trigger reset levels\" and apparently this can cut click latency by up to 30 ms. I can only assume that's just because you can lessen the travel distance with a lower actuation distance, given a mechanical switch shouldn't add any actual latency in itself.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>Logitech relays that, according to pro player Caps from G2 Esports, \"The difference feels like going from playing on public internet servers to playing on LAN.\" In the reaction videos I saw, pro players did genuinely seem impressed by the mouse and its inductive and haptic clicks.</p>\n    <p>Apart from that, the mouse seems like a standard lightweight and competitive gaming mouse. It has PTFE feet, up to 8 kHz polling (only with wireless as wired is limited to 1 kHz), 88 G of acceleration, 888 IPS, and up to 44,000 DPI. It has up to 90 hours of battery life under constant motion and weighs 65 g, which isn't quite as light as some ultralight mice you get these days, but is about as light as the original <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-gaming-mouse-review/\">Logitech G Pro X Superlight</a> which I still love as a mouse for competitive gaming.</p>\n    <p>Somewhat less exciting news is that Logitech is launching a smaller and lighter version of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-review/\">Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2</a>, the G Pro X Superlight 2c. That's set for launch on 21 October and will retail at £159.99.</p>\n    <p>The Superstrike is definitely the more exciting of the two, though, and will cost $179.99 / €179.99. And I must say, regardless of all its actually important specs and induction tech, that black-and-white colour scheme does look hella cool. It might be worth it just for that.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsjAnsNKJnd2WtdGNpZFeG.jpg\" alt=\"Razer DeathAdder V3 Hyperspeed gaming mouse\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1.

After revealing launch DLC that included two vampire clans, Lasombra and Toreador, Paradox and The Chinese Room have finally walked back the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/ive-played-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clans-lasombra-and-toreador-and-they-absolutely-should-have-been-in-the-base-game/\">questionable decision</a>, no longer locking away what are essentially two RPG classes.</p>\n    <p>Both clans will now be available in the base game at no extra cost, letting you flit around Seattle as a seductive monster or a manipulator of shadows.</p>\n    <p>\"Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition,\" said Bloodlines 2 executive producer Marco Behrmann. \"That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing.\"</p>\n    <p>Behrmann also thanked the developer for what has been a genuinely impressive turnaround for the concepts that will eventually become replacement DLC, a pair of story packs titled Loose Cannon and The Flower &amp; The Flame, due out in 2026.</p>\n    <p>\"We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.\"</p>\n    <p>So the base game will now feature all six clans, the Deluxe Edition will include the Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack (just some furniture for your flat), and the Premium Edition will include that DLC and an expansion pass, containing the new story packs.</p>\n    <p>This does mean less day one DLC, but honestly, who thinks that's a bad thing? Instead of paying extra for features that were designed in tandem with the rest of the game, we're getting new stories that will flesh out two characters—Brujah sheriff Benny and Toreador Primogen Ysabella—next year.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>And thankfully this won't impact the release date. Bloodlines 2 is still launching on October 21.</p>\n    <p>The DLC was a bad call, there's no way around it, but while Paradox doesn't always make the right call initially, the publisher is one of the best when it comes to responding and reacting to feedback, and its leadership team owns their mistakes.</p>\n    <p>Last year, deputy CEO Mattias Lilja and chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus sat down with me for an <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/the-dark-age-of-paradox-interactive-what-exactly-happened-to-one-of-pc-gamings-best-publishers/\">exhaustive chat</a> about what has been a tumultuous period for the company, and in 15 years of writing about games I've never had such a candid interview.</p>\n    <p>At the time, I wrote, \"What's clear is that it would be a mistake to count Paradox out. While it seems to be bouncing between cancellations and delays and rough launches like an out of control pinball, it's been here before. The stakes have never been this high, and the problems have never been this high profile, but it's got a proven track record of weathering storms.\" And I'm hoping that Bloodlines 2 represents this bounce back.</p>\n    <p>Certainly, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-first-hands-on-a-gory-undead-power-fantasy-that-im-desperate-to-play-again/\">what I played earlier in the year</a> gave me reasons to be excited. And when I played it again as the DLC (now not DLC) clans, I was still impressed.</p>\n    <p>So I'm not surprised there's been some kind of course correction. This happened with <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/paradox-apologizes-for-latest-cities-skylines-2-boondoggle-will-give-refunds-for-the-beach-properties-dlc-we-hope-we-can-regain-your-trust-going-forward/\">Cities: Skylines 2's first DLC</a>, too, which was quickly refunded and released for free. Until it actually happened, though, I wasn't willing to bet Paradox would change its DLC plans so dramatically. The publisher had a bunch of different options, and it went with the best possible one—at least for us—so I'm happy to put my fangs away.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: This year's upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: Our all-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RzLfPhiCtccjxVCZdTSgiD.jpg\" alt=\"Fraser Brown\"/>\n    <p>Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

Events ranged from collapsing roads, a raging storm, to even being able to flood the map. While these events added a bit of variety to the rounds, it was largely undirected and would lead to unintentional deaths. While I liked the concept, I can also see why the devs want a more nuanced approach to destroying the map.</p>\n    <p>Buildings in Battlefield 6 can still be destroyed as they were in Battlefield 4. The building at point C on Iberian Offensive would largely be non-existent by mid-game whenever I played. But the wreckage is more contained to specific pockets of the maps now. This by no means makes the chaos any less enjoyable, but it does mean your gravestone will hopefully be less likely to have 'collateral damage' written across it.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJ7JHgYv6WEL9dHitak4vS.png\" alt=\"The Dark Urge, from Baldur&amp;#039;s Gate 3, looks towards his accursed claws with self-disdain.\"/></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: Upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: All-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qB86w24sfMVFJqvStRDDHN.jpg\" alt=\"Elie Gould\"/>\n    <p>Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

While many begrudge the addition of AI tools into their daily lives, some find it very useful for summarising documents and spreadsheets, and helping them out with the odd bit of busywork.</p>\n    <p>Well, that last group should be particularly pleased with Microsoft's latest Copilot announcement, as the app is said to be installing alongside most desktop versions of Microsoft's 365 suite of apps next month—whether you like it or not.</p>\n    <p>\"Starting in October 2025, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices that have Microsoft 365 desktop client apps,\" <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1152323\">says MS</a> in a message center update, according to<a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-force-install-the-microsoft-365-copilot-app-in-october/\"> Bleeping Computer</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"This app provides a centralized entry point for accessing Copilot experiences and AI-powered capabilities across Microsoft 365.

You may have seen this coming, given that <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/the-microsoft-365-app-transition-to-the-microsoft-365-copilot-app-22eac811-08d6-4df3-92dd-77f193e354a5\">Microsoft rebranded the 365 app to the \"Microsoft 365 Copilot app\"</a> at the start of the year, but nevertheless, here we are.</p>\n    <p>Microsoft seems to have been on a big push in recent months to integrate Copilot into all and sundry, including pushing it <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/software/windows/microsoft-rolls-out-experimental-ai-mode-for-the-edge-browser-you-can-ask-to-spy-on-all-your-internetting-and-lend-a-helping-hand-yikes/\">into Microsoft Edge as an \"experimental feature\"</a> back in July—although for what its worth, it was purely an opt-in or opt-out affair. I can't imagine that the latest announcement of the app's forced installation will go down well with Microsoft 365 users, as they've already had to contend with <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/microsoft-office/microsoft-365-sees-43-percent-price-hike-thanks-to-copilot-existing-customers-safe-until-renewal\">a 43% price hike</a> as a result of its inclusion in Personal and Family plans earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>It's also not exactly the sort of behaviour that inspires goodwill towards a new feature, is it? I would say that if your userbase really, really wants a product, you don't necessarily have to force it on them—and I'd also posit that this sort of mandatory installation technique doesn't speak well of Copilot's adoption among users as a whole.</p>\n    <p>Still, you get a whole 15 AI credits per month with the subscription, so if you're the sort of person who finds Copilot useful, this might not be particularly big news. For those of you who simply want to type the odd document and view the odd spreadsheet free from AI-involvement, though, and without Microsoft's AI app cluttering up your machine, it's a pretty bum deal.</p>\n    <p>Is this the point where I mention that the completely-free <a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/\">LibreOffice alternatives</a> to all these 365 apps exist, and they're actually pretty good? Yep, I thought as much.

The guy with the maggots. You know who I'm talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>This week I've been: </strong>Playing around 47 hours of Borderlands 4. Send help, I'm trapped in the loot dimension.</p>\n<p>I've been playing the Borderlands series <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/im-ranking-every-borderlands-game-ahead-of-bl4s-release-from-worst-to-best-because-the-people-love-their-lists-and-im-here-to-provide/\">since its inception</a>, but I have something terrible to confess—I have never, not once, been tempted to engage in the endgame. The closest I've ever got was when I rinsed through Borderlands 3's DLCs (many of which were <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/if-you-cant-wait-for-the-new-borderlands-i-genuinely-recommend-bl3s-solid-dlc-campaigns-which-arent-nearly-as-obnoxious-as-the-base-game/\">shockingly good</a>), and even then, that was more coincidental.</p>\n<p>I'd simply run out of levels, so I was technically in the postgame. But I've never tried to get a build going, farm that all-important legendary, or so much as sneezed at a raid boss. I'm here to play 30 hours of a shooty RPG and then do something else.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-4/\">Borderlands 4</a>, though? Now I've chewed through the campaign, I'm severely tempted to get stuck back in. I <i>would</i> be, were it not for my professional obligation to actually write videogame words for this videogame website, so I'll settle for nattering at you about wanting to play more BL4 instead.</p>\n<p>It's a partially conflicted feeling, mind. I've still got tons to do on Kairos because you should actually <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/dont-get-stuck-grinding-in-borderlands-4s-version-of-the-hinterlands-in-fact-youre-screwing-yourself-out-of-exp-if-you-try-to-do-every-sidequest-before-beating-the-main-campaign/\">wait until after you've beaten the campaign</a> to do most of those side quests: However, I also have to recognise the clever trick Gearbox has pulled off here.</p>\n<p>While past Borderlands' post-games would see you churning through the same stuff you'd likely just spent 50-odd levels gnawing at, BL4 makes the game the postgame, so you can do endgame while you game-game. Am I making sense? I've been shooting very loud psychos for 47 hours and I can hear Claptrap in my walls.</p>\n<p>Let me put it another, less loot-addled way: All of the stuff you'd otherwise be doing in an open-world RPG <i>also </i>happens to be the best way to get your Specialisation levels—a post-campaign progression system fed by EXP—and legendary loot. The postgame is just playing an open-world RPG, mopping up sidequests and snagging collectables. In other words, exactly what I like.</p>\n<p>Two other factors also help. Firstly, the game has co-op level scaling, so if I want to hop in with a mate and grind out some of those delicious progression points, I can do that by tagging along with a buddy, even if they've not completed their campaign yet or are a much lower level than me.</p>\n<p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n<p>Secondly, you can now start a new character at level 30 if you've beat the main campaign. While this has given our illustrious guides writer Rory Norris <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4s-campaign-skips-could-be-a-double-edged-sword-for-gearbox/\">cause for concern</a>, I'm almost the opposite: I rarely try out other classes in these games, because that often-tedious starting grind is enough to put me to sleep. But now I can get stuck right in with the tinkering. There is, however, one obstacle: The Wildcard missions system.</p>\n<h2>A bad hand</h2>\n<p>Wildcard missions are cool in theory. Every week, you can up your world's difficulty (and loot) by playing through a story mission with enemy modifiers slapped onto the mooks you're shooting. Also, sometimes you get a <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-rainbow-vomit-location/\">Rainbow Vomit shotgun</a>.</p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2BGBNqCdBDSkP7LEYR9Wbc.png\" alt=\"Moxxi in Borderlands 4 looks skeptical as a stranger points a knife at her.\"/></p>\n<p>In practice, however, things are less peachy. My first Wildcard mission was the one in Carcadia where you need to re-route the water system—forcing me to spend the first 10 minutes flipping switches and listening to a long spiel I'd already heard before. Which, for Borderlands, is a criminal amount of time to spend not shooting somebody.</p>\n<p>My second Wildcard mission I had to repeat two goddamn times. See, these story missions can last upwards of 40 minutes, often taking you between several locations—and while you can die on them without having to start over, if you quit out of the game, it bugs, or you crash? Then you're screwed, bucko.</p>\n<p>I experienced my second-ever crash in 47 hours playing this Wildcard mission. On my second attempt, an enemy got stuck in a wall (also the first time that had happened) making it impossible for me to kill it before moving on.</p>\n<p>In a game this pockmarked with bugs—bugs that typically haven't ruined my enjoyment until now—you simply cannot have a 40-minute time investment that requires you to start over if it breaks. It sucks all the momentum out of the game's otherwise unerring loot, shoot, repeat momentum.</p>\n<p>The monologue problem rears its ugly head again here, too. I just so happened to be doing the mission that introduces you to the trio of main villains in the game—and so I had to listen to Zadra describe who the Timekeeper's lieutenants were for almost two straight minutes at the tail-end of the mission. Zadra, I like you, but I just spent like 30 hours finding and killing the Timekeeper's dastardly rogue's gallery. Me and the business end of my gun are intimately familiar.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/in-the-16-years-ive-played-this-series-borderlands-4-is-the-first-entry-thats-made-me-want-to-do-post-game-grinding-gearbox-just-needs-to-fix-its-dang-wildcard-missions-first/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But Arkheron, the first game from Bonfire Studios, is working a magic all its own on a genre the zeitgeist has left behind. During a preview event for press, studio founder and former Blizzard chief creative officer Rob Pardo said it was inspired by three concepts: Diablo dungeons and progression, PUBG PvP, and Dark Souls combat.</p>\n    <p>I wouldn't blame you for being skeptical, but the result looks more promising than it sounds.</p>\n    <p>Arkheron is set in a \"dark, surreal world,\" where teams of amnesiac souls battle in a purgatorial afterlife to ascend an ever-shifting tower built from the memories of the dead. Teams enter the tower, gain abilities from memory-haunted weapons and equipment, and compete to climb higher before the current floor is destroyed until one team eventually stands triumphant at the tower's apex.</p>\n    <p>At first glance, Arkheron's isometric perspective and hellish environs loudly ring a Diablo-esque bell. But as soon as it starts moving, it's clear that it's doing its own thing: Rather than moving and positioning with mouse clicks, Arkheron uses what Bonfire calls \"isometric free-aim combat\"—an ARPG camera angle where the mouse or analog stick controls horizontal camera movement and intuitive combat targeting.</p>\n    <p>It's a control scheme and presentation without many comparisons. It's like something between a third person and topdown shooter, but with the melee weapons, bows, and spell-slinging implements of a dark fantasy setting and abilities with skillshot potential that would feel right at home in MOBA teamfights. And the camera's pulled in close to the character to limit peripheral vision, which Pardo said puts melee and ranged combatants \"on equal footing.\"</p>\n    <p>Seeing Arkheron in action was one of those moments where something makes so much sense that I'm not sure how it isn't already an industry staple. The perspective and control scheme seems to lend itself to fast, flashy, and expressive fights that prioritize positioning situational awareness, but without the fiddly precision demanded by traditional shooter or mouse cursor controls.</p>\n    <p>In Arkheron, Pardo said, \"what you carry defines you.\" Throughout a match, players will cobble together builds based on the abilities granted by the equipment they collect. A pair of weapon slots define your combat style: An enchanted two-handed axe grants a leaping attack for jumping over walls that other items might create, while a heavy mace launches a wave of slowing ice energy.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>Two remaining slots go to amulets and crowns, which provide utility abilities. One amulet erects an electric energy barrier that blocks enemy projectiles but lets your team shoot through it, while a radiant crown might make you briefly invulnerable before exploding to steal life from nearby enemies when the effect expires.</p>\n    <p>While there's plenty of space for players to find their favorite synergies between relics, each piece of equipment is also part of an item set that offers a bonus if you equip two items from the same set. A set of fire-themed relics, for example, grants shorter ability cooldowns.</p>\n    <p>Having four item slots means players have the potential to mix and match up to two set bonuses. But if you find all four pieces of a set, you can instead embody the memories associated with the set and transform into an Eternal—themed hero characters who've remembered who they used to be.</p>\n    <p>Pardo hopes tying all the game's equipment to Eternal sets will provide two benefits: It lets Bonfire change up the meta by rotating out Eternals, and it gives the studio a chance to flesh out its fiction by exploring the Eternals' histories.</p>\n    <p>The words \"battle royale\" might not move the needle much in 2025, but it looks like Arkheron could be carving out its own space by twisting and blending genre conventions. If you're eager to see how it's shaping up, Arkheron is running its first Alpha playtest this weekend, which will be active daily from 11 am PDT to 11 pm PDT between Friday, September 19 and Sunday, September 21.

'Josh,' they said, 'please turn your prodigious wit, abundant taste, and inescapable sagacity to recommend the best possible game our readers could play here, now, in September of the year of our Lord 2025. Also, you are very handsome and have the slim, fine-boned hands of a pianist.'</p>\n    <p>Well, how could I refuse? So, after spending a lot of time thinking about it, I'm here to tell you that the game you need to play <i>right now</i> is Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl.</p>\n    <p>Because, look, you ever have a game that reminds you <i>what it's all about, man</i>? Something that comes along after you've spent weeks and months bouncing off stuff, grabs you by the collar, and won't let go? I have. It's Stalker.</p>\n    <p>Specifically, it's the remaster of Stalker that GSC put out a few months ago, and which you got for free if you already owned the originals. They add mod-cons like gamepad support, slightly (<i>slightly) </i>improved graphics, and support for higher resolutions.</p>\n    <p>We live in an era of dollar-sucking live-service thingummies and games that sing your praises as the chosen one as soon as you start a new save. A singleplayer, hard-scrabble, and free (if you own the OGs) Stalker has never been a more necessary antidote.</p>\n    <p>With the remaster of Shadow of Chornobyl (plus its two successor games: Clear Sky and Call of Prypiat), there's never been a better time to play it. I mean, you <i>could</i> play Stalker 2. I like that game plenty. But let's be honest, GSC still isn't quite finished making it. Best to stick with the classics for now.</p>\n    <p>Stalker was rare and odd when it first released in 2007 and it is, if anything, rarer and odder on the occasion of its remaster. The fantasy it provides is one of struggle—against nature, against man, against your own desire to pick up every bit of loot you see despite having an encumbrance limit of 50kg—rather than the exponential power fantasies we're used to outside of everything but survival games today. Also, unlike survival games, Stalker never asks you to punch a tree, so point there for GSC.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>But really, the reason you need to play Shadow of Chornobyl is because the remaster also added Steam achievements. Uh oh.</p>\n    <p>It's that bit that has, maybe, perhaps, wormed its way into my brain and set me on the ravenous path of 100%ing the whole thing. Reader, I don't know what came over me. I just love being in the Zone so much that I was eager for any and every excuse to remain there, and if that meant reloading old saves to painstakingly die to every individual type of anomaly or to summarily execute that one guy you find bleeding out next to a train carriage at the start of the game, then so be it.</p>\n    <p>There's something narcotic about the achievement pop, even when the cheevos are relatively value-less Steam ones. It's a kind of ersatz productivity, a feeling that you're checking tasks off a list when actually you're eating 25 breads (yes, breads). I was locked in on catching 'em all like I haven't been on anything else in years (except, uh, work, to which I am 110% dedicated, PCG editors).</p>\n    <p>There's just something about polishing off the cheevo list on an all-timer game—effectively encasing it in perspex for permanent display as a \"Perfect game\" on your Steam profile—that appeals to me. That appeal becomes all the more overwhelming when it's relatively fresh territory, and when you can finally get the recognition you deserve for finding Fang's exoskeleton armour (it's in a Prypiat stash).</p>\n    <p>It's a call (of Prypiat) too seductive to resist and, hey, the remaster is pretty great on its own merits too, so far as I'm concerned.

This is the successor to the WD Black SN850X, which was our previous pick for the best SSD. It's not the fastest drive on the market—given it's a Gen 4 SSD not Gen 5—but it's about as fast as most people will need <i>and </i>comes in at an incredibly reasonable price.</p>\n<p>The SN7100 offers the same level of performance as the SN850X, if not better, but has managed to save some costs by getting rid of the DRAM cache, having denser NAND, and making it all single-sided. And that NAND, by the way—Kioxia 218-layer BiCS8 TLC NAND—plus the SanDisk Polaris 3 A101 controller, makes for one speedy SSD.</p>\n<p>While sequential read/write is great too (we clocked it at 7,116 MB/s), Random 4K performance blew us away. Our Zak, who tested the drive, says it \"absolutely demolished every drive I've tested on the [Random 4K] read front, scoring an insane 101 MB/s.\" RND4k is what translates to gaming performance, and this drive performs well there, too.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you want the fastest SSD around, you should pick up a speedy PCIe 5.0 one like the <a href=\"#section-the-best-pcie-5-ssd\">SN8100</a> below. But Gen 5 drives, even when priced competitively, are still far more expensive than Gen 4 ones like this one. And the real-world difference for most use cases—especially gaming—will be negligible. That's why we've stuck with a Gen 4 at the top of this list as the best SSD for gaming.</p>\n<p>And when it comes to Gen 4, the SN7100 is easily top of the list, just like its predecessor, the SN850X. The latter will presumably be phased out before long, and the SN7100 is here to take its rightful place on the throne thanks to a balance of cost, speed, and efficiency. It's the best SSD on the market right now, all things considered.</p>\n<p/>\n        </cell>\n        <cell role=\"head\">\n          <p/>\n        </cell>\n        <cell role=\"head\">\n          <p/>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"4\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>\n<h2>The rest of the best SSDs</h2>\n<p>We have individually and independently tested and reviewed <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/storage/reviews/\"> 33 different SSDs</a> in the past two years.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-gaming-ssd\"/>\n    </p>\n<p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sd6ymiEMCezypEAKrCmzZL.jpg\" alt=\"An SSD on a red background\"/></p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Best budget</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The best budget SSD is the Biwin Black Opal NV7400.

With impressive speeds nearing the limit of what PCIe 4.0 can offer, it's no slouch. Moreover, it's priced in such a way to heap pressure on the competition. Even without any sort of discount, 2 TB of NV7400 will cost you just <a href=\"https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8432&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DM23JKXC%2Fref%3Dtwister_B0FDY3RGH6%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dpcg-us-1393079376382213164-20\">$120</a>. That's just $0.06 per gigabyte.</p>\n<p>When game install sizes are easily topping 100 GB without much of a second thought, the fact you can buy 2 TB of speedy storage for so little is a real gamechanger. It means we can safely hoard installs for a few live service games, heaps of indies, and whatever Twitch is playing that's all the rage right now without having to delete or redownload a thing.</p>\n<p>The NV7400 is aptly named for its sequential read speed, which, wouldn't you know, lands at 7400 MB/s. That's right near the top of what's possible from a PCIe 4.0 x4 connection. You'd need to invest in a PCIe 5.0 drive to get substantially faster, but that requires spending a whole lot more.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ssd-for-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The mad lads have somehow gotten the idea that Ryu Ga Gotoku studio is set to announce a prettified, Kiwami re-do of Yakuza 3. Why? Well, uh, because Ryu Ga Gotoku studio went and wrote the words \"Kiwami 3\" on its website.</p>\n    <p>Spotted, as ever, by enterprising <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/\">Redditors</a>, the words \"龍が如く 極3\"—Japanese for Yakuza Kiwami 3—briefly appeared on the RGG studio site's news page. It's since vanished, but you can easily verify that it <i>was</i> there with Google: the search engine's all-seeing eye cached the page and will still surface it if you ask nicely.</p>\n    <p>With an RGG Summit event happening next week, it didn't take much for those same Redditors to start theorising that someone at RGG had gotten a little ahead of themselves with an announcement pencilled in for the show. \"The summit is next week so they will announce [it] there,\" wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/comment/nep0gxt/\">Ahokai</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"I think Kiwami 3 will be revealed at the RGG Summit next week. But, since RGG is busy with Virtua Fighter 6, Stranger than Heaven, and presumably LaD 9, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a few years for it to be released,\" wrote a user named <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Blue_Sheepz/\">Blue_Sheepz</a>.</p>\n    <p>Which is certainly where I'd announce it, but I gotta be honest: I had previously thought RGG was done Kiwami-fying its games after Kiwami 2, which originally hit PS4 in 2017. The original Yakuza 2 was the last game made in the heyday of the PS2. Everything after it feels a lot more modern, and Yakuza 3 through 5 have all gotten HD releases on modern platforms (save Switch) since their original launches.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLsyt2Wrq2B6EWyXKXXczk.jpg\" alt=\"Kiryu gives a thumbs up to the screen.\"/></p>\n    <p>Still, it'd certainly be a welcome surprise, and might finally kick my ass into playing through Yakuza the Third. I certainly enjoyed Kiwami 1 and 2 enough to give it a shot.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/new-games-2025-upcoming-pc-release-schedule/\"> 2025 games</a>: This year's upcoming releases</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/\">: Our all-time favorites</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-free-pc-games/\">: Freebie fest</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Free PC games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/\">: Finest gunplay</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best FPS games</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-rpgs-of-all-time/\">: Grand adventures</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best RPGs</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-co-op-games/\">: Better together</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Best co-op games</strong>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SXuALfFkYbTT9o5tjJroaV.png\" alt=\"Joshua Wolens\"/>\n    <p>One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

We've had people declaring the impending ascent of Arm or RISC-V for years now, and the market hasn't budged. By and large, people still want to buy Intel and AMD systems running x86 Windows. So, maybe what's needed isn't replacement but reform, and maybe that should be in the form of <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2749469.2750391\">SHRINK</a>.</p>\n    <p>That's not a new proposal—the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) paper is dated June 2015, coming out of the 42nd annual symposium—but it might be new to you. It was to me. It was brought to my attention by <a href=\"https://x.com/lauriewired/status/1968017412143583390\">LaurieWired on X</a>, who points out that just 12 of the 1,000+ mnemonics (instructions) on modern CPUs <a href=\"https://x.com/lauriewired/status/1968017414123388938\">make up 89% of compiled C/C++ code</a>.</p>\n    <p>And even if we don't go down the C/C++ route (as <a href=\"https://x.com/LeoVasanko/status/1968075327768506445\">some suggest</a> that this might not cover all instruction bases), the SHRINK research paper shows there are lots of unused instructions over time accounting for all bases: \"We consider instructions that belong to vector extensions in separate categories [than unused], because albeit unused, they are still under adoption and their UISes are likely to be used in the future.\"</p>\n    <p>The apparent over-abundance of instructions is often seen as both a boon and a downside to the x86 architecture. It's very versatile and can do a lot—thus why most consumer apps are built for it and why most home PCs use it—but it doesn't do it in the most efficient way. That's led competitors such as Arm to step in with seemingly more efficient chips, albeit chips that can struggle with app compatibility.</p>\n    <p>The solution to x86's problem of large swathes of mostly redundant and unused instructions, according to the researchers who made the paper, could be SHRINK, which \"provides a method for recycling instructions (i.e., removing unused and/or infrequently-used instructions and strategically reassigning their encodings to more frequently used instructions), and a mechanism to emulate the removed instructions.\"</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZf4p7JE3uqji82cC3Eqe9.jpg\" alt=\"AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor\"/></p>\n    <p>The interesting word there is \"emulate.\" It seems like the idea is that a large chunk of instructions—the lesser-used ones—can be removed from the actual instruction set and instead emulated in software when needed.</p>\n    <p>The researchers \"conclude that at least 40% of the x86 ISA, even after excluding multimedia extensions, could be emulated with minor performance overhead in the analyzed execution traces.\"</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>Other x86 debloating attempts have been made, such as <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-proposes-x86s-a-64-bit-cpu-microarchitecture-that-does-away-with-legacy-16-bit-and-32-bit-support/\">Intel x86s</a>, which sought to remove 16-bit and 32-bit instruction support. This was <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-terminates-x86s-initiative-unilateral-quest-to-de-bloat-x86-instruction-set-comes-to-an-end\">terminated just last year</a>, though. LaurieWired <a href=\"https://x.com/lauriewired/status/1968017418087018584\">points out</a> that a big part of the reason why it's hard to debloat x86 is just because \"a lot of it is IP / legal hell.\" The x86 ISA isn't just an Intel product, remember: It's largely a cross-licensed affair between Intel and AMD. I wouldn't fancy working through that mire.</p>\n    <p>And I suppose there's an argument that debloat isn't needed, too. While many like to point out the efficiency of Arm chips (for example) compared to x86 ones, we've seen in recent years that some x86 chips can be mighty efficient, too. Just look at Intel's latest Lunar Lake mobile chips.</p>\n    <p>Still, as my programmer friend would likely remind me, redundant and unused code isn't a good look. Maybe some SHRINKage wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ryUJb6snbbQMdpHJu7i8W.jpg\" alt=\"AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1.

Further, they ask why the government blocked the transparency and enforcement mechanisms demanded by rights holders during the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2025/18/contents\">Data (Use and Access) Act</a>.</p>\n    <p>“Administration of copyright must be transparent. And it must have an artist’s full permission. These two principles are the bedrock of our industry and crucial for the survival of future generations of world-beating UK creatives,” wrote Elton John, whose storied career as a singer-songwriter spans over 50 years.</p>\n    <p>“What is being waved through leaves the door wide open for an artist’s life work to be stolen, skimmed, and scraped by Big Tech AI companies. We will not accept this, and we will not let the government forget their election promises to support our creative industries.”</p>\n    <p>“The UK government should not be valuing corporate interests above the rights of its citizens. It should not be giving away our cultural heritage and our creative future to Silicon Valley,” added Robert Smith, lead vocalist of The Cure. “It should instead be standing up to the Big Tech AI companies that continue to ignore the many long-established laws of copyright. Artists and creators must retain control over their own work; any eroding of this basic right is simply wrong.”</p>\n    <h4>The letter cautions that refusing to take the steps necessary to make existing law enforceable risks ceding control of the UK’s creative economy—and the rights of its citizens—to overseas interests.</h4>\n    <p>The UK government is looking to finalize a tech trade agreement with the United States during President Trump’s visit. Any potential deal will undoubtedly feature AI as a foundational component.</p>\n    <p>During the passage of the Data (Use and Access) Act, the former Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Peter Kyle; and former Creative Industries Minister, Chris Bryant, committed to creating a Parliamentary Working Group to enable the House of Commons and House of Lords to have greater input into policy development. Thus far, that group has yet to be formed—and both Kyle and Bryant left their roles in the recent government reshuffle.</p>\n    <p>Initial meetings of Industry Working Groups, bringing together creative and tech stakeholders, have taken place. But reports have criticized the lack of (UK-based) AI representation, leading to fears that British tech companies are being overlooked in favor of supporting larger, U.S.-based competitors.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/uk-creators-pm-creators-human-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The country’s recorded music industry maintained robust growth during the first half of the year, with revenues hitting €162.6 ($178 million)—up 10.4% year-over-year.</p>\n    <p>The news comes via <a href=\"https://www.promusicae.es/en/news/the-spanish-recording-industry-growth-in-the-first-half-of-2025-n594/\">new data published</a> by Promusicae, the trade party that represents 95% of the Spanish recorded market. Notably, Spain’s figures are reported in wholesale “trade value” terms for the first time, which represents actual revenue rather than consumer spending. Promusicae previously released data in retail value. Spain’s H1 2025 revenues at retail value would clock in at €288.8 million ($316 million).</p>\n    <h4>That growth stands in stark contrast to other major markets, especially in Europe and the U.S., where year-over-year revenue growth has <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/10/us-music-revenue-h1-2025/\">stayed in the single digits</a> this year overall. In the United States, recorded music revenue increased by just 0.9% in H1, per the RIAA, while Germany saw 1.4% growth. France saw higher growth than most, with a 3.4% year-over-year increase.</h4>\n    <p>Overall, Spain’s wholesale music streaming revenue hit €144.2 million ($158 million) during the first half of the year, a growth of 10.2% year-over-year—but those numbers reveal a mixed bag in terms of subscription and ad-based streaming platforms. Paid subscription streaming saw €103.7 million ($113 million) in wholesale revenue, up 18.9% year-over-year.</p>\n    <p>It’s worth mentioning that Spotify did not raise prices in Spain during the period in question, which makes those figures even more impressive. However, sources say Spain will see a <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/pro/spotify-price-increase-industry-weekly/\">€1 per month increase in the price</a> of standard Spotify Premium accounts this month.</p>\n    <p>Ad-supported audio streaming revenue during the same period declined by 15.4% to just €18.6 million ($20 million). Ad-supported video streaming revenues stayed relatively flat, showing just 1.3% growth to €21.8 million ($24 million). But the decline in ad-supported revenues likely reflects deteriorating per-stream advertising rates across the industry, rather than reflecting strong user migration.</p>\n    <h4>According to Promusicae’s data, total streaming revenues now make up 88.6% of Spain’s total recorded music market.</h4>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the country’s physical market also showed surprising growth in H1, with a 14.8% year-over-year increase to €17.4 million ($19 million). That growth was driven almost exclusively by <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/01/17/vinyl-sales-2024-luminate-analysis/\">vinyl sales</a>, which soared by 25.6% to €12 million ($13 million), representing 68.8% of all physical sales revenue. Spain’s physical market sits at just 10.7% of total market sales and streaming revenues.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/spanish-recorded-music-industry-h1-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Can AI create a life form? These “generative” genomes are a start</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can draw cat pictures and write emails. Now the same technology can compose a working genome.</p>\n<p>A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses—and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.</p>\n<p>The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the “the first generative design of complete genomes.”</p>\n<p>The work, described in a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675911v1\">preprint paper</a>, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an “impressive first step” toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by <i>MIT Technology Review</i>.  </p>\n<p>Boeke says the AI’s performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. “They saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,” he says.</p>\n<p>This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That’s because viruses are not alive. They’re more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes.</p>\n<p>In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria—called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters.</p>\n<p>To do so, they used two versions of an <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/generative-ai-tool-marks-a-milestone-in-biology\">AI called Evo</a>, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses.</p>\n<p>But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with <i>E. coli</i> bacteria.</p>\n<p>That led to a profound “AI is here” moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.</p>\n<p>“That was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,” says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out.</p>\n<p>Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working—that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them.</p>\n<p>J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/08/25/200992/how-to-remake-life/\">organisms with lab-made DNA</a> nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”</p>\n<p>For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. “We did the manual AI version—combing through the literature, taking what was known,” he says.</p>\n<p>But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\">claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024</a> for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses<strong>. </strong>For instance, doctors have sometimes tried “phage therapy” to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria.</p>\n<p>“There is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,” says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei’s lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients’ bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones.</p>\n<p>The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven’t taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists—out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice—could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality.</p>\n<p>“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it’s random so you don’t know what you are getting,” says Venter. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”</p>\n<p>Whether an AI can generate a bona fide genome for a larger organism remains an open question. For instance, <i>E. coli</i> has about a thousand times more DNA code than phiX174 does. “The complexity would rocket from staggering to … way way more than the number of subatomic particles in the universe,” says Boeke.</p>\n<p>Also, there’s still no easy way to test AI designs for larger genomes. While some viruses can “boot up” from just a DNA strand, that’s not the case with a bacterium, a mammoth, or a human. Scientists would instead have to gradually change an existing cell with genetic engineering—a still laborious process.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, a cell-engineering company in Boston, says exactly such an effort is needed. He believes it could be carried out in “automated” laboratories where genomes get proposed and tested and the results are fed back to AI for further improvement.</p>\n<p>“This would be a nation-scale scientific milestone, as cells are the building blocks of all life,” says Kelly. “The US should make sure we get to it first.”</p>\n<h3>Deep Dive</h3>\n<h3>Biotechnology and health</h3>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120769/exclusive-record-breaking-baby-born-embryo-over-30-years-old/\">\n        <figcaption class=\"image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123801/ai-virus-bacteriophage-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Forget the glorious successes of past breakthroughs—the real justification for research investment is what we get for our money. Here’s what economists say.</p>\n<p>MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.</p>\n<p>Given the draconian cuts to US federal funding for science, including the administration’s proposal to reducethe 2026 budgets of the National Institutes of Health by 40% and the National Science Foundation by 57%, it’s worth asking some hard-nosed money questions: How much should we be spending on R&amp;D? How much value do we get out of such investments, anyway? To answer that, it’s important to look at both successful returns and investments that went nowhere.</p>\n<p>Sure, it’s easy to argue for the importance of spending on science by pointing out that many of today’s most useful technologies had their origins in government-funded R&amp;D. The internet, CRISPR, GPS—the list goes on and on. All true. But this argument ignores all the technologies that received millions in government funding and haven’t gone anywhere—at least not yet. We still don’t have DNA computers or molecular electronics. Never mind the favorite examples cited by contrarian politicians of seemingly silly or frivolous science projects (think shrimp on treadmills).</p>\n<p>While cherry-picking success stories help illustrate the glories of innovation and the role of science in creating technologies that have changed our lives, it provides little guidance for how much we should spend in the future—and where the money should go.</p>\n<p>A far more useful approach to quantifying the value of R&amp;D is to look at its return on investment (ROI). A favorite metric for stock pickers and PowerPoint-wielding venture capitalists, ROI weighs benefits versus costs. If applied broadly to the nation’s R&amp;D funding, the same kind of thinking could help account for both the big wins and all the money spent on research that never got out of the lab.</p>\n<p>The problem is that it’s notoriously difficult to calculate returns for science funding—the payoffs can take years to appear and often take a circuitous route, so the eventual rewards are distant from the original funding. (Who could have predicted Uber as an outcome of GPS? For that matter, who could have predicted that the invention of ultra-precise atomic clocks in the late 1940s and 1950s would eventually make GPS possible?) And forget trying to track the costs of countless failures or apparent dead ends.</p>\n<p>But in several recent papers, economists have approached the problem in clever new ways, and though they ask slightly different questions, their conclusions share a bottom line: R&amp;D is, in fact, one of the better long-term investments that the government can make.</p>\n<p>This story is part of MIT Technology Review’s \"America Undone” series, examining how the foundations of US success in science and innovation are currently under threat. You can read the rest here.</p>\n<p>That might not seem very surprising. We’ve long thought that innovation and scientific advances are key to our prosperity. But the new studies provide much-needed details, supplying systematic and rigorous evidence for the impact that R&amp;D funding, including public investment in basic science, has on overall economic growth.</p>\n<p>And the magnitude of the benefits is surprising.</p>\n<p>Bang for your buck</p>\n<p>In “A Calculation of the Social Returns to Innovation,” Benjamin Jones, an economist at Northwestern University, and Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist and former US Treasury secretary, calculate the effects of the nation’s total R&amp;D spending on gross domestic product and our overall standard of living. They’re taking on the big picture, and it’s ambitious because there are so many variables. But they are able to come up with a convincing range of estimates for the returns, all of them impressive.</p>\n<p>On the conservative end of their estimates, says Jones, investing $1 in R&amp;D yields about $5 in returns—defined in this case as additional GDP per person (basically, how much richer we become). Change some of the assumptions—for example, by attempting to account for the value of better medicines and improved health care, which aren’t fully captured in GDP—and you get even larger payoffs.</p>\n<p>While the $5 return is at the low end of their estimates, it’s still “a remarkably good investment,” Jones says. “There aren’t many where you put in $1 and get $5 back.\"</p>\n<p>That’s the return for the nation’s overall R&amp;D funding. But what do we get for government-funded R&amp;D in particular? Andrew Fieldhouse, an economist at Texas A&amp;M, and Karel Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas looked specifically at how changes in public R&amp;D spending affect the total factor productivity (TFP) of businesses. A favorite metric of economists, TFP is driven by new technologies and innovative business know-how—not by adding more workers or machines—and is the main driver of the nation’s prosperity over the long term.</p>\n<p>The economists tracked changes in R&amp;D spending at five major US science funding agencies over many decades to see how the shifts eventually affected private-sector productivity. They found that the government was getting a huge bang for its nondefense R&amp;D buck.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123760/how-to-measure-the-returns-to-rd-spending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation. </p><p>Groq, which also sells data center computing power, previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/ai-chip-startup-groq-lands-640m-to-challenge-nvidia/\">raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation</a> in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates.</p><p>Groq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq’s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs, (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine — specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Its products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster. The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google and OpenAI. Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives.</p><p>Groq’s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/secretive-semiconductor-startup-groq-raises-52m-from-social-capital/\">emerged from stealth</a>. TPUs <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu\">still power Google Cloud’s AI services.</a></p><p>Groq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/ai-chip-startup-groq-lands-640m-to-challenge-nvidia/\">talked to TechCrunch</a> a year ago.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

A source close to the deal said the round valued Irregular at $450 million.</p><p>“Our view is that soon, a lot of economic activity is going to come from human-on-AI interaction and AI-on-AI interaction,” co-founder Dan Lahav told TechCrunch, “and that’s going to break the security stack along multiple points.”</p><p>Formerly known as Pattern Labs, Irregular is already a significant player in AI evaluations. The company’s work is cited in security evaluations <a href=\"https://www.irregular.com/publications/claude-3-7-sonnet-evaluation\">for Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.irregular.com/publications/openais-o3-and-o4-mini-security-evaluation\">OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models</a>. More generally, the company’s framework for scoring a model’s vulnerability-detection ability (<a href=\"https://www.irregular.com/publications/introducing-solve\">dubbed SOLVE</a>) is widely used within the industry.</p><p>While Irregular has done significant work on models’ existing risks, the company is fundraising with an eye towards something even more ambitious: spotting emergent risks and behaviors before they surface in the wild. The company has constructed an elaborate system of simulated environments, enabling intensive testing of a model before it is released.</p><p>“We have complex network simulations where we have AI both taking the role of attacker and defender,” says co-founder Omer Nevo. “So when a new model comes out, we can see where the defenses hold up and where they don’t.”</p><p>Security has become a point of intense focus for the AI industry, as the potential risks posed by frontier models as more risks have emerged. OpenAI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/07/openai-tightens-the-screws-on-security-to-keep-away-prying-eyes/\">overhauled its internal security measures</a> this summer, with an eye towards potential corporate espionage. </p><p>At the same time, AI models are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/ai-slop-and-fake-reports-are-exhausting-some-security-bug-bounties/\">increasingly adept</a> at finding software vulnerabilities — a power with serious implications for both attackers and defenders.</p><h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3><h4>Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country’s top regulator has not taken a final action.</p>\n    <p>One of the two apparent problems with Tesla’s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren’t receiving power from the car’s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.</p>\n    <p>“The idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,” von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. “That’s something that we’re working on.”</p>\n    <p>NHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window “to regain entry into the vehicle.”</p>\n    <p>Tesla includes instructions in its owner’s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings — meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/tesla-is-redesigning-its-door-handles-following-safety-probe-bloomberg-investigation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They’re joined by co-founder <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rob-bishop\">Rob Bishop</a>, who sold his computer vision and machine learning company, Magic Pony Technology, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/twitter-is-buying-magic-pony-technology-which-uses-neural-networks-to-improve-images/\">to Twitter</a> in 2016.</p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https://blog.macroscope.com/blog/introducing-macroscope\">describes its product</a> as an “AI-powered understanding engine” that’s designed to save engineers time, and the type of product the founders “<a href=\"https://macroscope.com/about\">wish we’d had</a>” when building their earlier companies.</p>\n<p>Today, engineers use a variety of tools to keep track of work, like JIRA, Linear, and spreadsheets, and spend too much time in meetings instead of building, Beykpour says. Macroscope is designed to fix this.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>“I feel like I lived this pain…at every company I worked at, whether it was the startups that we built ourselves, or whether it was enormous public companies like Twitter, we sort of lived this problem the hard way,” Beykpour told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>\n<p>“Trying to get a sense for what everyone was doing, especially when you have an organization like Twitter with thousands of engineers, it was literally most of my job — and my least favorite part of my job as the head of product at Twitter,” he said.</p>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<h3>Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025</h3>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>To address this issue and others, Macroscope’s customers first install its GitHub app, which gives the company access to the code base. They can then optionally install other integrations, like a Slack app, Linear app, and JIRA app. The software then does the rest of the work by analyzing the code and noting what’s changing.</p>\n<p>This involves a process called code walking, which uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) — a structural representation of programming code — to gather important context about how the customer’s code base works. That knowledge is then used in conjunction with large language models (LLMs).</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>Once up and running, engineers can use Macroscope to discover bugs to fix in their PRs (pull requests), summarize their PRs, get a summary of how the codebase is changing, and ask code research-based questions. Meanwhile, product leaders could use the software to get real-time summaries of product updates, productivity insights, answers to natural language questions about the product, code, or development activity, and more. This can help them determine what teams are prioritizing in terms of engineering allocation.</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>“You can ask natural language questions, regardless of what your technical ability is,” notes Beykpour. “This might be very useful if you’re trying to learn about the code base without distracting a senior engineer on your team. Very valuable. If you’re a CEO and you want to understand literally, ‘what did we get done this week?’, your options are either ask Macroscope or go distract some teammates,” he adds. “One is a lot more expensive than the other.”</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>While there isn’t a product that offers a direct competitor to all that Macroscope offers, it does compete in the code review space — where developers examine and test code changes before they’re implemented — with tools like CodeRabbit, Cursor Bugbot, Graphite Diamond, Greptile, and others. However, the company said when it ran its own internal benchmark of over 100 real-world bugs, its product caught 5% more bugs than the next-best tool. It also generated 75% fewer comments. (It <a href=\"https://blog.macroscope.com/blog/code-review-benchmark\">shared its benchmark publicly in a blog post</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Macroscope</p>\n<p>The software costs $30 per active developer per month, starting at five seats, and offers enterprise pricing and custom integrations for larger businesses. It requires the use of GitHub Cloud. Ahead of its launch, a number of startups and larger firms have been using the product, including XMTP, Things, United Masters, Bilt, Class.com, Seed.com, ParkHub, A24 Labs, and others.</p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based startup has a team of 20 and is backed by $30 million in Series A funding, which was closed in July and led by Michael Mignano at Lightspeed. Other investors include Adverb, Thrive Capital, and Google Ventures. To date, Macroscope has raised $40 million total.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meet-macroscope-an-ai-tool-for-understanding-your-code-base-fixing-bugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

While appearing to admit to the murder and describe how he was planning to retrieve his gun, he pivoted to mention why he had carved messages into the ammunition.</p>\n<p>“Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme,” Robinson texted, according to authorities.</p>\n<p>Robinson’s shooting of Kirk has put the spotlight on the intersection of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-death-us-violence\">political violence</a> and an increasingly nihilistic<strong> </strong>online world that promotes misinformation and extremism. It’s a confluence that raises fundamental questions about how internet culture influences both extremist attacks and how we understand them, at a time when some of the biggest online spaces are increasingly more divisive and less moderated.</p>\n<p>Robinson appeared to spend much of his life on the internet and playing video games, with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/technology/charlie-kirk-meta-x-tiktok.html\">friends describing him</a> as “terminally online”. He was active on Discord, a messaging platform popular among the gaming community, and as a teenager dressed up as internet memes for Halloween.</p>\n<p>Bullet casings from the gun he allegedly fired<strong> </strong>were engraved with niche references and internet-speak – “notices bulge OwO what’s this”, a reference to a meme about sex within the online Furry subculture, “if you read this you are gay LMAO”, “Hey Fascist! CATCH!”, as well as the controller movements to use a special bomb in the popular video game Helldivers 2 and the lyrics to the antifascist song Bella Ciao, which has become popular among gamers after featuring in the game Far Cry 6.</p>\n<p>In Robinson’s exchanges with his roommate, who he was also romantically involved with, he appeared to have been thinking of how the ironic messages would be received.</p>\n<p>“If I see ‘uwu notices bulge’ on fox new [sic] I might have a stroke,” Robinson texted.</p>\n<p>With the references, Robinson fits a modern trend of attackers leaving behind messages that not only show they are products of an online culture, but are in conversation with it. In recent years, a growing number of shooters have left behind writings, whether full manifestos or single sentence posts online, that contain nihilistic in-jokes and references that aim to differentiate their extremely online cohort from the “normies” who will struggle to understand them.</p>\n<p>The manifesto left behind by the neo-Nazi who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 contained both extreme white nationalist ideology and <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2019/03/15/shitposting-inspirational-terrorism-and-the-christchurch-mosque-massacre/\">“shitpost”-style ironic references</a> to video games and podcasters<strong>. </strong>The man who opened fire at a supermarket in El Paso, Texas, that same year <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/08/04/the-el-paso-shooting-and-the-gamification-of-terror/\">announced his killings on the message board 8chan</a>, prompting users to create memes and encourage others to try to “beat their high scores” in body count.</p>\n<p>Extremist mass killings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/4chan-radicalize-buffalo-shooting-white-supremacy\">at a supermarket in a predominately Black area of Buffalo, New York</a>, in 2022 and at a <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/04/28/ignore-the-poway-synagogue-shooters-manifesto-pay-attention-to-8chans-pol-board/\">synagogue in Poway, California</a>, in 2019 were both heavily versed in the language of fringe online forums. A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/international-teenage-neo-nazi-network-feuerkrieg-totenwaffen-accelerationism-2022-7\">multi-newsroom investigation in 2022</a> that pored over tens of thousands of messages from an international neo-Nazi extremist network found that the chats were inflected with memes and gaming slang as they planned to commit violence.</p>\n<p>In addition to speaking to their online communities, attackers are also often in dialogue with each other, whether in some far-right circles where extremists celebrate individuals as “saints” with their own memorialized days or simply through copying elements of previous killings. As <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-assassination-online-reaction/684201/\">others have noted</a>, Robinson’s writing on the bullet cases is similar to meme messages left on ammunition and firearms by the young shooter who <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/minneapolis-church-shooting-influencers/684083/\">attacked</a> a Minneapolis Catholic school. It also echoes the engravings that United Healthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione allegedly left on his bullets, which became a meme to the point it <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDfpMyKzMY8/?hl=en\">featured on shirts</a> from a popular alt-fashion label.</p>\n<p>Robinson’s engravings themselves don’t offer a cohesive explanation for Kirk’s killing. Prosecutors say Robinson told his roommate he shot Kirk because the conservative activist was spreading hatred. They also allege that his mother told investigators that her son had spent the previous year or so becoming “more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented”.</p>\n<p>But much about Robinson’s path to radicalization is still unclear. There is an enormous gulf between holding opposition to Kirk’s views and carrying out a targeted killing. And increasingly, experts say, the motivation of shooters, particularly young ones, don’t fit neatly into a traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-roommate\">left-right spectrum</a> but are shaped by the fractured, heavily online state of modern politics. Ignoring the messier nature of radicalization in lieu of fitting attackers into convenient boxes risks missing what actually drives people to commit acts of extremist violence.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>The radicalization of being online</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Instead of trying to find precise meaning in the irony soaked, trolling messages that attackers have left behind, extremism researchers argue that it’s often more useful to look at how online mediums are broadly shaping radicalization. In fact, some say that the current era of political violence differs from past incarnations specifically because of the way that social media and online communities have influenced and incentivized attackers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/charlie-kirk-suspect-online-memes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>We are Rae and Will AKA raeandwill, a clown duo who specialise in mime – so asking us to write about the 10 funniest things we’ve seen on the internet is technically considered a hate crime. But if the endless scroll of other people plugging their clown shows has taught us anything, it’s that we have to maintain our digital facade or risk being unbooked and unblessed. And if there’s one thing the world desperately needs more of, it’s clown shows. (We aren’t joking.) So here we are.</p>\n<p>Will thinks the internet is a demonic, vacuous hole that is slowly stripping him of his humanity :( And Rae is convinced that the internet has made her stronger, hotter, funnier, and in no way damaged her brain :)</p>\n<p>While these might look like differing takes on the internet, they’re really just ways of coping with the fact that we live in a world of never-ending loops of AI foods eating themselves. Some of us try to pull away, some of us dive in headfirst but in the end we’re all just scrolling through the chaos together and, diva, that’s where the magic happens. Creatively, the internet is our third collaborator. Before anything becomes a multi-award-winning show (we have to show off; see: fear of being unbooked and unblessed), our ideas usually start online. We spend months hoarding vibes: collecting images, videos and random clips that feel connected to the seed of our project.</p>\n<p>Here are the 10 funniest things that feel connected to the seed of our funny bone.</p>\n<h2>\n      <i>\n        <strong>Will</strong>\n      </i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Will</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>1. Flutterbye fairy toy flies into fire</h2>\n<p>This is one of my all time favourites. Childhood innocence interrupted by the most dramatic piece of classical music. The perfect accompaniment for Flutterbye Fairy as she does the unspeakable. RIP.</p>\n<h2>2. Lano and Woodley – Fly</h2>\n<p>In the long lineage of comedic duos, I bloody love Lano and Woodley. I think the care and detail they put into the silliest and simplest of moments, like Woodley’s Oscar-deserving embodiment of a fly, is deeply inspiring. I could nerd out about their technique for hours, and I won’t bore you here, but I do owe them some form of thanks. And you reading this, sure, it is not a 10-second reel, but stick with it.</p>\n<h2>3. Julio Torres’s masterclass on hand acting</h2>\n<p>This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n<p>Any time someone shows me a new piece of media from the icon and aspirational twunk Julio Torres, I insist that they see the hand acting masterclass from their Instagram in 2020. It includes classic scenarios and how-tos such as “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_I2BA4Hy0M/?img_index=2\">BRING … ME … THE GIRL!</a>”, “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_I2BA4Hy0M/?img_index=5\">Offering her the potion but warning her that everything has a price</a>”, and, of course, “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_tF5yAnDSa/\">Basic scenarios for Advanced Hand Acting; Handrail, ascending and descending</a>”.</p>\n<p>An essential watch for any budding young actor who wants to become a silent clown in the future. There are at least three separate posts of lessons in there. Happy scrolling.</p>\n<h2>4. Jennifer Lopez’s past five years, specifically her inauguration performance</h2>\n<p>During Covid, in the dying days of President Trump’s first term, we had a glimmer of hope – Jennifer Lopez’s performance at Joe Biden’s inauguration. While JLo’s self-funded film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/15/jlo-movie-review-this-is-me-now-a-love-story\">This Is Me … Now: A Love Story</a> and its <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/greatest-love-story-never-told-review-jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-1235918825/\">accompanying documentary</a> (an incredible double feature) both deserve to be on this list, it’s this moment that takes the cake for me. Specifically, her decision to mash up America the Beautiful and This Land Is Your Land with her 1999 party anthem Let’s Get Loud.</p>\n<p>The attempt to shift this song from the dancefloor into the political sphere is so beautifully unhinged. Combined with her performance, it makes me scream, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry. I will speak about it for decades and perhaps write a dissertation on it.</p>\n<h2>5. The pet performers who get paid to act like animals</h2>\n<p>“We may not receive the applause because we are doing it for an audience who can’t clap.” Performance for domestic animals is a vital and dignified art form and nothing you can woof will convince me otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<h2>\n      <i>\n        <strong>Rae</strong>\n      </i>\n    </h2>\n<p>\n      <strong>Rae</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>1. I Will Always Love You</h2>\n<p>Oh my God. If this isn’t the most potent look into who I was as a child, I don’t know what is. The ambition. The frustration. The inability to regulate. As someone who is famously a bad singer, I just so deeply relate. Bless this girl and wherever she is now. Thank you for your service, queen.</p>\n<h2>2. Trisha Paytas’s entire body of work</h2>\n<p>Trisha Paytas was probably the first person I truly laughed at online. It was impossible to pick just one video but this is one of the first I remember. Fifteen years later, she’s still producing some of the world’s best, most richest content. It’s delusion wrapped in confidence wrapped in talent wrapped in more talent, dipped in even more talent. Get her on Broadway YESTERDAY.</p>\n<h2>3.

They're already budget-friendly, so these discounts make them even more appealing as an upgrade, and they feature mini LED technology for impressive brightness.</p>\n    <p>While a variety of models are on sale, I want to focus on the two that have found their way into a few of our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-tvs/\">favorite television roundups</a>. First up is the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/tcl-qm6k/\">TCL QM6K</a> (8/10, WIRED Recommends), a screen that impressed us with its excellent balance, screen uniformity, and color reproduction across the entire panel. It has great off-angle viewing too, if you've got a big or oddly shaped TV room, and has great quality-of-life features, like a dedicated eARC HDMI port for your soundbar.</p>\n    <p>If you have a particularly bright home, or a bigger budget, you might also consider the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/tcl-qm8k/\">TCL QM8K</a> (9/10, WIRED Recommends). This upgraded TV is one of the most premium mini LED screens we've had the pleasure of testing, with top-tier colors for the category. It's also exceptionally bright, which is perfect if you're stuck somewhere you can't pull the shades and turn out the lights every time you want to watch a movie.</p>\n    <p>Both screens have Google TV for their interface, which is one of our preferred platforms for built-in streaming. It's super fast and responsive, and has a massive catalog of apps and streaming options, even if you aren't an Android user. Both the QM6K and QM8K also have impressively thin bezels, which doesn't help performance, but will make these feel a bit more modern hanging on your wall or sitting on your entertainment stand.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/BzWhgJVfGnESm5Hjzoj4joXYzqJcveTu68u9kevsvLxoZzTXcmcEPVrRAUrm6tEwdPSP88V9rCi4sAQYoFXrsn3Mcrxpxzh883vbX6sJFRX7RQFgnZpxAuxhwVhDyxwcJxyjFM3BhENbhcXD26tDUJA6mYLi9SvXNSHQzDDsWyfmrZ8tsp1PqGyE6xFGc7wSDn3P3xTftWjx4eDuDN8w6bpJ93n4Nipsy4TFRYrNcrhc4NcZGRXG6Jw8EwQTzAKZZ7G1ZP4z9wgFiPer7Ac5q2napBhhF7qkHGCc6B4ghLzThvhATaxk8kEzZEToPqk77sUKEkrieZRZaXZvMSV518AqMDmidBrxvSztzE8mmUjcdY\">65-inch QM6K is marked down from $1,000 to just $650</a>, a healthy 35 percent discount for an impressive mid-tier television.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n    <p>Looking to learn a new language? Reading is a great way to start, and you don't need a physical book to do it: Here's how to change your Kindle's language (and download books in other languages!) to learn right from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">your favorite e-reader</a>.</p>\n    <p>Reading a different language helps you expand your vocabulary and nail down nuances like sentence structure, and for visual learners like myself it can be the ideal way to start really learning information. Lucky for all of us e-reader lovers, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">Kindle's</a> ebook store has books in all kinds of languages that you can purchase or download through Kindle's subscription services like Kindle Unlimited and Kids+. You can always <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-free-kindle-books-with-your-library-card/\">send an ebook from your library</a> that's in your learning language of choice to your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-ereaders/\">e-reader</a>, too.</p>\n    <p>But it's not just with books: You can change your Kindle's settings to switch the device itself to speak in one of 10 languages: German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese. Here's how to do it and how to find books in other languages.</p>\n    <h2>How to Change Your Kindle’s Language Settings</h2>\n    <p>Changing the settings is pretty easy. You'll head to the Settings menu on your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">Kindle</a> and select Device options, and then one of the options will be Languages and Dictionaries. You'll choose that option, and there will be four items to choose from: Language, Dictionaries, Keyboards, and Chinese Characters Sort Order.</p>\n    <p>The Language menu will do what you expect, letting you choose from among the device's 10 languages to set your device to. Changing the language will prompt the Kindle to restart and load itself in your chosen language, though the books in your library will remain in their original language. Dictionaries will give you options based on your language of choice. (English has two different Oxford dictionaries, for example.)</p>\n    <p>Keyboards lets you add keyboards in different languages without actually changing your Kindle's overall language. There are more keyboard options—27 total—than language options on the Kindle. This is because some languages have more than one keyboard option: English, Spanish, and Japanese each have two keyboards to choose from, while Chinese has three. But you'll also see keyboards for other languages you can't change the entire device to, like Arabic and Swedish.</p>\n    <p>The final setting in the Languages menu will sort Chinese characters, if Chinese is a language you choose. There are three sort orders (Hanyu Pinyin, Stroke Order, and Zhuyin Fuhao) to choose from.</p>\n    <h2>How to Download Books in Other Languages</h2>\n    <p>In the same way you can obtain books in your preferred language through various methods, you can also access books in different languages on your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">Kindle</a>.</p>\n    <p>The easiest way is the Kindle Store, which has a Foreign Language section you can choose to find books in different languages to buy with your Amazon account. (You'll want to click the cart icon on the upper right in your library, then Browse Categories, See All Book Categories, and then Foreign Languages will be on that list to select). It'll let you filter by language and will show you the most popular options.</p>\n    <p>My best seller results seemed influenced by my own downloads in English, since Spanish versions of <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> that I loaded onto my <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft-kids-2025/\">Kindle Colorsoft Kids</a> for my son immediately popped up. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/106m10g/how_to_buy_kindle_version_of_japanese_books_from/\">According</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/b3vv2q/buying_books_in_spanish/\">Redditors</a>, you can also change your region on your Kindle device to get more ebook options in other languages that might not be available through Amazon's US store. That will require changing your settings for your entire Amazon account, though, so you'll have to get off your Kindle to do that work-around. You can also still add <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-free-kindle-books-with-your-library-card/\">library ebooks</a> or even download PDFs or other files in other languages to read them on your Kindle.</p>\n    <p>Stressed about where to start? It's usually recommended to start with a book you've read before to make it easier to learn the language; that way you don't have to worry about understanding the story. Happy reading in whatever language you please!</p>\n    <h2>Kindles Worth Shopping</h2>\n    <p>Don't have a Kindle yet to take advantage of these features? Here are our favorite models, and you can learn all about every Kindle we've tried in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">Best Kindles</a> guide.</p>\n    <p><i>Power up with unlimited access to</i> WIRED<i>.</i><i>Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

For those of us with partners who refuse to let us place all that stuff around our rooms, and who want real cinematic sound, wireless class D soundbar systems like the new Samsung HW-Q990F take out all the fuss and hardly compromise on sound relative to similarly priced traditional home theaters.</p>\n    <p>Just place the bar below your TV, the subwoofer near an outlet, and the rear surrounds somewhere that they can bounce sound properly off the walls and ceiling, and you have a ready-to-go 11.1.4 system that sounds hilariously good for the lack of complexity.</p>\n    <p>Sure, you can’t swap out a receiver every time standards change, but I don’t see anything beyond Dolby Atmos (which this is more than capable of) coming down the line anytime soon. As long as you don’t fear change, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-soundbars/\">a high-end soundbar system</a> should be good enough for years. Samsung itself seems to know this well: The previous-gen model <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/samsung-hw-q990d/\">HW-Q990D</a> is still for sale <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/GGbsdh6NSfdXtmiEa9Kw9KMuDBwpQCnznw3cfkMZaEa9u5nnzpDMSm6bHEZuRAZkU8z4HLk5NdsHovvrbnTx4oqfXNFLnA5okNLXHW62vnEidvmkFo5ydAQ7mZR3CFVFb2kbGeWv8din8ATpcpBL4yqSSebKxdk6VZgegH2NWwysg8jFg7WKycomys84Xmccb8yiGeeZVRgbVNoY4tY68CgRwb2RagKkNiX78JJr7Lhrh936uvHRicDWZJYczRURTN4BowXH21p7ZcziffeuX6JjJSb8fgzfCPHxpCkeigZXC6pMoCzxfUmsfeZhjpGYNwJP8Azo1dDBHQayMjothcq4xL5CWdZMHnf3mhQCDnCkN9tEun76N2ayqWLyjWZgzmD4wgqbYW46Qir7z3XntoewpbjFooqxRsx2bhKuNW9B6B5rarFSm2mJMzyqyXXtZcWRnXtUTUV8wFcpcKDPmyV2QBryDsTe9z\">on its own website</a> for the same price as the new bar.</p>\n    <h2>Bar None</h2>\n    <p>The large cardboard box containing this soundbar system contains the main bar, a subwoofer, and two surround speakers.

They have a fantastic new look—one that adds more character with a two-tone design highlighting the blend of the aluminum chassis and glass. The “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/exciting-camera-features-on-apples-new-iphone-17-lineup/\">Camera Plateau</a>,” as Apple calls it, elongates the camera module and gives it a more balanced appearance and feel. (Although I have to say, Google <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-7-pixel-7-pro/\">did it first</a>.)</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/everything-apple-announced-iphone-air-iphone-17-apple-watches-airpods-pro-3/\">The specs</a> might not read as revolutionary on paper: a bigger battery, a brighter screen, better performance, and a new telephoto zoom camera. There's no singular feature that'll make you go, “Wow!” But when you actually experience these individual improvements, they combine to become more than the sum of their parts. There are no <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-26-and-ipados-26-top-new-features/\">major AI features</a> being shoved down your throat (for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-sued-by-shareholders-over-ai-disclosures-2025-06-20/\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-wwdc-ai-announcements/\">reasons</a>). It's a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/\">better iPhone</a> in every way.</p>\n    <h2>Level Up</h2>\n    <p>The Cosmic Orange color was calling my name, but alas, Apple provided me with the Silver iPhone 17 Pro Max and Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro. I switched to these phones after using the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-air\">iPhone Air</a> for several days, and I yelled, “Holy crap,” after picking them up. They are heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro models, and they feel like bricks compared to the thin and light Air.</p>\n    <p>I like the Camera Plateau. The two-tone separation of glass and aluminum just makes it more visually interesting. You might say, “It's just a phone,” but when a gadget looks and feels great, it makes using it all the more enjoyable, and I think Apple has done a nice job here. The phone also no longer rocks on a table as much as before, so, yay!</p>\n    <p>Apple switched from titanium to aluminum to make these chunky phones lighter, but the material change also improves thermal conductivity. Talking about heat dissipation isn't sexy (it <i>is</i> hot), but it's a key improvement in the new iPhones. When you're playing a graphically intensive game, your iPhone will start to get very hot as the processor does its job. At a certain point, if things get too hot, the processor starts to throttle itself so it doesn't overheat, but it means your performance suffers, resulting in stuttering and skips in your gameplay. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple is finally using a vapor chamber cooling system to help dissipate heat.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The iPhone 17 Pro felt like a brick. I had just gotten used to the featherweight feel of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro/\">new iPhone Air</a> after several days of use, but it was time to switch to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max\">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. Suddenly, I didn't want to let the Air go.</p>\n    <p>It's amazing how a couple of grams and a slimmer profile can drastically change the feel of a phone. There isn’t much to grab on the edges, but the Air's design is whimsical and somewhat paradoxical. It feels like a twig that can snap in a heartbeat, but the sturdy titanium frame dispels any notion of fragility.</p>\n    <p>I was prepared to hate the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/\">iPhone Air</a>. Why make a thin phone with lackluster battery life? A single-camera system for $999? After spending some time with it, I'm pleasantly surprised. I still <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/which-apple-iphone-17-models-to-buy/\">don't think most people should buy it</a>—it's for early adopters who want to experience Apple's thinnest iPhone to date—but it's a promising blueprint of what's to come.</p>\n    <h2>Thin Air</h2>\n    <p>The iPhone Air is just 5.6 millimeters thick and 165 grams; contrast that with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a smaller screen yet weighs 206 grams and is 8.75 mm thick. It's a palpable difference. Initially, you might feel like the lighter weight makes the Air seem “cheap,” but that notion quickly disappears. This phone feels strong, durable, and rigid.</p>\n    <p>I watched Apple perform a bend test on the iPhone Air, and it was able to withstand more than 130 pounds of force with no damage. I gave it a good bend test myself, but it didn't flex. We'll need to see how this phone performs in the hands of a wider audience, but I think you can put your pitchforks away—no <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/09/iphone-6-plus-bendgate/\">#bendgate</a> here. This durability stems from the use of titanium for the frame, along with Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro/\">Ceramic Shield 2</a> protecting the display, and Ceramic Shield 1 layered over the back. Apple says this mixture makes the Air more durable than any prior iPhone.</p>\n    <p>I can't imagine buying this ultrathin phone and putting a case on it, but I didn't mind <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/BNj2avZQdZFTVGiYqoBhf6x1rqG4fKCS2W4Hzysoj6vedTGQQirMLtchPwhoxWDPBqQgsb1ZUQDqUJZeP7nfm2T4aXguXcgNB2psMLYykJxXwjsytUUaZjadM882WzkrVuPkZbG1bmrVJo88x2rWPjTXEk3y4gTBcpzAP3urBzZ5Wh8BkRWzrSLpSf6GarmdhHK6JXKLCSevFU3LaWX7XPANxUSUSKwcgEaxXA36wQoNWa3nkVTjEPgEU1dfRM8jvZ1R9qtrJYPXST5JgMAhFhYmzL9XmcR13AC4CRo\">Apple's bumper case</a>. The phone still feels light and thin, but the slightly thicker edges of the bumper make it easier to grasp. Annoyingly, despite using a horizontal camera bar like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-google-pixel-phone/\">Google's Pixel phones</a>, the camera still sticks out enough that the Air rocks on a table when you tap a corner—a small nitpick.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-air/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

E-readers (short for ebook readers) are just so convenient—and they might just <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kindle-ebook-digital-reading-rave/\">make you read more too</a>. Rather than lumping two or three books in a bag, an e-reader lets you carry thousands of books or dozens of audiobooks in a single, slim, rectangular tablet. Their paperlike screens are easy on the eyes, and unlike an app on your phone, they won’t inundate you with distracting notifications. Books can also be expensive and take up a lot of physical space, but that’s not a problem with ebooks. Even better, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-free-kindle-books-with-your-library-card/\">you can check out</a> digital books from a library without leaving your house.</p>\n<p>Naturally, when you hear “e-reader,” you might think Kindle.

It has a screen with an oxide backplane, which Amazon says delivers better contrast and image quality along with custom-formulated coatings and nitride LEDs for brightness and color accuracy. But the screen is capped at 150 ppi for color images, versus 300 ppi for black and white, and the experience of reading is still a little fuzzier when compared to the latest Paperwhite. It takes noticeably longer to process color images, too. It's missing features that are by now standard on other color e-readers, like page turn buttons and stylus support. It's not a</p>\n<p><i>bad</i>Kindle, and color does enrich the whole e-reading experience, but we suggest waiting for a discount during an Amazon sale event.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Meta Connect, the annual event that serves as both the company’s developer conference and a platform for its new hardware announcements, is happening this week.</p>\n    <p>Meta CEO <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> is expected to take the stage at <strong>5 pm Pacific</strong>, <strong>8 pm Eastern</strong>, and <strong>1 am British Summer Time</strong> on Wednesday, September 17, to announce a fleet of new smart glasses. We also expect to hear some updates on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/meta/\">Meta’s</a> machine intelligence efforts, and maybe a hint or two about how things are going at the company’s fledgling <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-leave-meta-superintelligence-labs-openai/\">AI superintelligence</a> lab.</p>\n    <p>You can watch the video of the Meta Connect livestream from <a href=\"https://horizon.meta.com/event/1459744492118268/\">Meta’s Horizon site</a> or on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers\">Meta for developers Facebook page</a>. Unlike Apple or Google, Meta doesn’t stream its conference keynote on YouTube.</p>\n    <p>If you’re all in on the virtual reality future, you can also watch the event on a Meta Quest headset by going into the <a href=\"https://horizon.meta.com/event/1459744492118268/\">Horizon page</a> and selecting the VR viewing option.</p>\n    <p>If you’re a developer and want to register for Connect, you can do that by plugging your name and email into the <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/connect/\">Meta Connect website</a>. In the upper-right corner, look for a button that reads “Register for the livestream.” Enter your information and you’ll get information about additional presentations and developer sessions.</p>\n    <h2>What to Expect</h2>\n    <p>While there may be some surprises at the event, Meta did fumble its reveal earlier this week when it accidentally <a href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-hud-wristband-clips-leak/\">leaked images</a> of some new glasses that seem queued up to be announced at Connect. The leaked image includes the word Display, which could hint that Meta is looking to put out a new pair of glasses with an actual display built into the lenses.</p>\n    <p>The company showed off its ambitions for such a wearable device at its Connect event last year when it debuted its prototype <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-orion-glasses-augmented-reality-mark-zuckerberg/\">Orion frames</a>, which relied on a wristband for navigation and a wireless puck for connectivity and computing power. The design of last year’s frames used waveguide technology to create virtual displays of images, text, and videos that appear in the wearer’s vision. Developers have had access to Orion frames for a year, so the technology is likely ready for its next step.</p>\n    <p>We’re also expecting new models of the smart glasses developed by Meta and its main brand partners, <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/wayfarer-matte-black-graphite-polar-gradient/\">Ray-Ban</a> and <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn-clear-grey-transitions/\">Oakley</a>.</p>\n    <p>Tune in at 5 pm Pacific on Wednesday for more coverage of Meta Connect 2025 as it happens live.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-connect-2025-how-to-watch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They nourish the body, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/breeding-stronger-magic-mushrooms/\">enhance the mind</a>, and occasionally poison the unlucky. Their biochemical adaptability has intrigued Eastern cultures for centuries. The West has been slow to embrace mushrooms until the 21st century, propelled in part by endorsements from celebrities like Gisele Bündchen and Gwen Stefani.</p>\n<p>Today, in a zeitgeist fixated on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/category/gear/products/health-fitness/\">biohacking and self-optimization</a>, mushrooms are now tools for functional wellness. Gone are the days of foraging and sautéing. Instead, we embrace microdosing. We’re enjoying lion’s mane extract in our adaptogenic lattes and mixing non-GMO cordyceps into our post-workout smoothies, aiming to enhance our cognitive function, boost our gut health, and upgrade our immune systems. Health care researchers are also exploring their potential applications, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mushrooms-pdq\">cancer therapies</a> to supportive treatments for <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10532592/\">Covid-19</a>.</p>\n<p>For more mushroom coverage, check out our guides to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mushroom-gummies/\">Best Mushroom Gummies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mushroom-coffee/\">Best Mushroom Coffee</a>.</p>\n<p><i>Updated September 2025: I've added Om Master Blend Mushroom Gummies, Plant People WonderDay Mushroom Gummies, Slumber Rest &amp; Renew Mushroom Sleep Gummies, and Laird Superfood Organic Coffee with Functional Mushrooms as new favorites. I've also updated information, prices, and links.</i></p>\n<h2>What Are Functional Mushrooms?</h2>\n<p>Functional mushrooms, often referred to as medicinal or adaptogenic, offer more than just nutritional value. The excitement surrounding them isn’t due to recent studies; their advantages <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/adaptogenic-drinks-the-race-to-make-your-coffee-do-more-and-more/\">have been recognized</a> for years. What has shifted is the way they are presented, allowing for simpler integration into contemporary lifestyles without the need for cooking.

Hippocrates is said to have used amadou, a spongy fungus, to reduce inflammation. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26854098/\">Ötzi the Iceman</a> had amadou in his supplies (probably for fire-starting), along with birch polypore, which was likely used to fight intestinal parasites. Native American cultures pressed puffball mushrooms onto wounds to halt bleeding and aid healing. Additionally, they used <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8175741/#:~:text=Tiger%20milk%20mushroom%20(TMM%3B%20Lignosus,different%20ailments%2C%20including%20respiratory%20disorders.\">tiger milk mushrooms</a> to treat asthma.</p>\n<p>East Asian traditions have long used <i>Phellinus</i> fungi to treat <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814622016934\">digestive issues</a>. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/\"> Ganoderma lucidum</a>—commonly known as reishi or lingzhi—was first recorded in the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/shennong\">, the oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, written over two millennia ago, where it was classified as a tonic for anti-aging and</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454782&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=Cancer.gov\">boosting qi</a>. In modern-day China, reishi is often recommended to support immune function in</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/mushrooms-pdq#_128\">patients undergoing chemotherapy</a>or radiation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38116085/\"> Inonotus obliquus</a>—better known as chaga—has been a staple in traditional medicine among Indigenous communities across the world. Notably, native Siberians would grind up chaga and add it to teas, soups, and stews, believing it to ward off degenerative diseases. It was also a remedy for ulcers, liver ailments, and tuberculosis. Russian First Nations used it to slow the growth of visible tumors. Today, hunters in rural Russia still consume chaga to boost endurance on long treks.</p>\n<h2>Are Mushroom Supplements Good for You?</h2>\n<p>Nutritionists agree: food first. Whole mushrooms (fruiting body, mycelium, and all) like maitake, shiitake, and lion’s mane offer fiber and nutrients you won’t get from mushroom blends. Toss them into stir-fries, omelets, or soups. While supplements don't always deliver the same results, here are some of the health benefits seen with regular intake.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/advances/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/advances/nmab015/6174025\">review</a> of 17 cancer studies shows that consuming about 1/8 cup of mushrooms a day may lower your risk of cancer by as much as 45 percent. Fungi are packed with ergothioneine, an amino acid and antioxidant that slows cellular damage. Shiitake, oyster, maitake, and king oyster have some of the higher amounts of ergothioneine, but any variety of mushrooms is better than none.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad180959\">clinical trial</a> in Singapore, participants who ate more than two cups of mushrooms (golden, oyster, shiitake, and white button) a week had a 50 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p>Unlike many foods that are broken down by stomach acid, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10358859/\">the polysaccharides in fungi</a> remain intact as they pass through the stomach. This allows them to reach the colon, where they can prompt the growth of healthy bacteria.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/7-health-benefits-of-mushrooms\">Certain shrooms also provide vital nutrients</a> that can support your overall well-being. Cremini and portobello are high in selenium, a mineral that produces antioxidant enzymes to prevent cell damage. Maitake mushrooms are a great source of vitamin D, and incorporate shiitake into your diet for vitamin B6.</p>\n<h2>The Top Functional Mushrooms, Explained</h2>\n<p>From nootropic lattes to adaptogenic powders, certain species have become stars in the wellness space. Here's what the research and experts have to say about the fungi dominating your feed.</p>\n<p><i>(</i></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-mushroom-supplements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Did I immediately intuit, as someone well-versed in <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksongs-speedrunning-community-is-already-at-it-dismantling-the-games-mechanics-like-mad-scientists-less-than-a-day-after-release/\">the sicko behavior</a> of gaming speedrunners, that three hours was probably a really fast clear time for this indie game with its throwback 8-bit graphics that includes its own built-in randomizer? Of course not.</p>\n<p>\"Three hours!\" I thought. \"What a breezy, compact adventure this will be. A perfect little snack while I take a short break from dying over and over in Silksong.\" Well, I've now spent almost three hours dying over and over in Zexion instead, and I'm nowhere <i>near</i> finished with it. Apparently Silksong had beaten the ability to spot a speedrun right out of me.</p>\n<p>Zexion is not a mini Metroid like I first thought: judging by HowLongToBeat, it's likely a bit longer than Super Metroid and a good bit longer than several of the other games in the series. But that still makes it compact in comparison to Silksong or Hollow Knight—and the dozens of deaths haven't gotten under my skin thanks to generous checkpoints and boss fights that take all of 23 seconds to finish.</p>\n<p>Because Zexion looks so much like a lost '80s game, I was caught off guard by just how many cool ideas it dished out in its opening minutes:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>It's a twin stick shooter, with the right stick letting you aim freely in eight directions while moving</li>\n      <li>Jump is wisely bound to both A and left bumper on a controller, optionally freeing up the left thumb for aiming</li>\n      <li>Dying to a boss gives you the option to start from right before the boss room or from your last save point. OPTIONAL RUNBACKS ONLY!!</li>\n      <li>The initial movement power-ups, a wall jump and slide move, arrive incredibly quickly, granting access to multiple possible routes</li>\n      <li>Terminals in map rooms fill in a new portion of the map for you and let you view everything you've revealed so far, but otherwise you can only view a minimap of the nearby area</li>\n      <li>While I've held out on using any yet, the Assist menu offers some welcome options: adjustments to damage taken, ammo refills, a full map reveal, save states and even speeding up or slowing down the game</li>\n      <li>It's not as solitary as most Metroid-likes: From the start you regularly see (and then fight) other explorers who are on the planet Cypher-X72 looking for the same resource as you</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>One of the comments on that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojb4Z4gWVoQ\">three hour YouTube video</a> described Zexion as \"basically Metroid 1 If they Locked tf in\" and that really does capture the essence of it. Zexion may be a bit too high tech for actual NES hardware—and Nintendo would've needed analog sticks to be able to make a twin-stick shooter—but it does effectively feel like a game that could've been designed by the same team years later with more experience under their belts.</p>\n<p>I'd find some of Zexion's crueler old school tendencies, like the amount of damage you take from spike traps and enemies bumping into you more annoying without the frequent save points and boss fight restart options. I also more than doubled my health bar by finding energy tanks in the first couple hours, while in more than 15 hours of time spent in Silksong I've gotten one measly extra pip of health.</p>\n<p>Zexion does seem stingy with health and missile refills at first, but it's more generous and more clever than it looks. Spend enough time shooting random walls and empty spaces and you'll start finding hidden blocks that drop ammo, while certain types of enemies will always drop health.</p>\n<p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n<p>It's simple stuff compared to the environmental storytelling in Silksong, where you can start to see how an entire society fits together, but it still satisfies that basic itch of these types of games: feeling out how the world ticks. It's also refreshing to play a game so interested in the Metroid and uninterested in the <i>vania</i>—there's none of the leveling up or looting or more RPG-esque mechanics that now come almost as standard.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392510/Zexion/\">the same price on Steam</a> I'd struggle to recommend anyone play it <i>instead </i>of Silksong, but it's an excellent chaser. The pace is faster, the boss fights are simpler, and you don't have to grind any sort of currency to unlock your next save point. I may turn that damage slider down to half, though. Silksong's already given me enough bruises for the month.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>If you discovered Team Cherry's latest really isn't for you, you should also check out the </i>\n      <i>nine metroidvanias we recommend instead</i>\n      <i>.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Wes has been covering games and hardware for more than 10 years, first at tech sites like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/\">The Wirecutter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tested.com/\">Tested</a> before joining the PC Gamer team in 2014.

But when it released the PTR for this year's Legion Remix event, which was just given an October 7 release date, fans quickly discovered that the fun had been <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzard-promises-to-add-speed-power-and-fun-back-to-wow-legion-remix-after-disappointing-players-with-a-time-gated-grind/\">removed</a>.</p>\n    <p>All the methods of gaining absurd amounts of power were chained to a schedule of weekly updates. Compared to MoP Remix, which was all there from the start, the severe restrictions on gear guaranteed that nobody would even have enough power to solo raids, which sort of defeats the point of going back in time to rampage through old stuff.</p>\n    <p>Blizzard quickly issued <a href=\"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-war-within-patch-1125-development-notes/2149725/5\">a response</a>, saying it would make \"major improvements with a goal of adding speed, power, and fun to the mode,\" in another week of PTR testing. Sure enough, the next PTR had a long <a href=\"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-war-within-patch-1125-development-notes/2149725/7\">list of changes</a> that essentially removed all of the gear and stat restrictions that would've made Legion Remix a boring slog.</p>\n    <p>Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ndsr1t/comment/ndjcuqf/\">Mantid9</a> said it was \"not quite MoP Remix levels\" of power, but that it was \"way better than before, and you can actually get insanely strong in earlier phases, which was not really possible before.\"</p>\n    <p>Some players are still bummed that new dungeons and events remain locked behind weekly updates, but I suspect that's there to keep players relatively in sync with each other so they can group up in the later stages. It's possible critics could be right and it feels like a giant roadblock that only exists to keep people playing for longer periods of time. I guess we won't really know until next month.</p>\n    <p>Legion Remix will be open for anyone to play. All you need is a WoW subscription (or a free trial account) to start a new character that you'll be able to transfer over to the normal game—without their overpowered gear—when the event ends. Blizzard has sprinkled in changes you can read about in the <a href=\"https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24225601\">blog post</a>, like a \"Heroic World Tier\" that increases the difficulty and rewards of all the enemies in the open world.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwnnY4PZ7TcCYKRYDho7VW.jpg\" alt=\"Razer Blade 16 gaming laptop\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1.

There, they were met with the Rupture strain: new varieties of burrowing bug enemies that proved to be an immediate source of controversy by mercilessly kicking people's asses.</p>\n    <p>Rupture Warriors, the burrowing variant of the mainstay Terminid fodder, quickly became the most hated Helldivers hazard after players realized they were <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n74h72/rupture_warriors_are_much_easier_to_avoid_if_you/\">more lethal to mission hosts</a>. While other players had a chance to dodge their lunges as they launched out of the dirt, host players found themselves repeatedly hewn into piles of wet chunks by an onslaught of unavoidable Terminid talons.</p>\n    <blockquote><a href=\"\">Rupture warriors are much easier to avoid if you aren't the mission host</a>from<a href=\"\">r/Helldivers</a></blockquote>\n    <p>Earlier this week, Arrowhead <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/787688820859470905?l=english\">deployed a patch</a> to spare mission hosts from suffering disproportional Terminid violence. Unfortunately, rather than making Rupture Warriors less threatening for host players, the update made them just as relentless for <i>everyone else.</i></p>\n    <p>You'll be shocked to learn, I'm sure, that players <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nicgev/oh_youve_got_to_be_joking_right/\">didn't receive this news well</a>.</p>\n    <p>Evidently, even with the Rupture Warrior lethality being more evenly distributed, the new bug varieties aren't behaving as Arrowhead hoped. In <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1njdkm6/rupture_strain_offline_at_6pm_today_cest/\">an announcement</a> posted earlier today, the studio said it would be putting the Rupture strain in prolonged time out so it can retune the behavior of their various bladed extremities and bile sprays.</p>\n    <p>\"Our patch yesterday combined with other issues regarding the balance of the Rupture Strain have made them function in a way we did not intend,\" Arrowhead said. \"We're going to take the Rupture Strain offline at 6pm today CEST. No other units will be affected. The improved Rupture Strain will be back online in 5 weeks.\"</p>\n    <p>As of roughly four hours ago, Helldivers can once again roam the stars without the threat of something bursting out the sand and snipping off their limbs in the blink of an eye. For a few weeks, anyway. Then it's right back into the bug blender—but at least the blender should be a bit more sportsmanlike.

It's one of pop culture's favorite names for heroes, tough guys, regular Joes (well, technically regular Jacks), and occasionally even villains. Characters named Jack are so common that Jeff Bridges and Kevin Bacon have each played characters named Jack seven times, Tom Cruise has been a Jack three times, and even Jack Nicholson—our most famous Jack—has been a Jack twice (Jack Torrance in The Shining and Jack Napier in Batman).</p>\n    <p>Videogames have a long history of Jacks as well—it's just a good, solid, go-to name in a game.

Consider naming them Jack.</p>\n    <p>That's what our quiz is all about today.

A new map and quests for a two year-old game, and no charge? Such largesse is only possible thanks to the involvement of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has made many gaming investments as part of its mission to detoxify the image of the brutal petrol state.</p>\n    <p>The DLC will see Basim, Mirage's protagonist, visiting AlUla, an ancient city key to Saudi Arabian culture. It was also announced by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in Riyadh at the New Global Sport Conference, an event that ran alongside the Saudi-funded Esports World Cup.</p>\n    <p>\"We are working with AlUla, which is a UNESCO site, which is not known yet very much,\" Guillemote said at the time. \"But we are creating content that will be given for free to players that play Mirage, and they will be able to go in that site.</p>\n    <p>As to the question of whether the DLC is being fully funded by the PIF, Ubisoft says it does \"not comment on rumours.\"</p>\n    <p>It appears that Ubisoft staff are not particularly happy about the publisher getting into bed with the Saudis. In an internal Q&amp;A <a href=\"https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia\">first published by GameFile</a>, one employee came right out and asked: is partnering up with Saudi Arabia, specifically in the context of the murder and subsequent dismemberment of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, really worth the hit to the company's image?</p>\n    <p>The response is uninspiring. Guillemot's visit was as part of a French delegation, including president Emmanuel Macron, and was described as a \"classic diplomatic tool for expanding France's influence and reach around the world\" that would help spread its values. I'm not sure that such contemporary values would necessarily include the French revolution's darker excesses but hey… plus ça change.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pP4idKwBFCH9vGLkf6g87c.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin&amp;#039;s Creed Mirage &amp;amp;mdash; Basim leaps into combat with sword and dagger.\"/></p>\n    <p>Ubisoft also says, somewhat unconvincingly, that Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman and the PIF are different things. \"The latter's money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values ​​does not mean abandoning them,\" says the publisher. The PIF is controlled by the crown prince, so not sure I'm buying that one.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>Ubisoft has subsequently sought to emphasise that it retains \"creative control,\" <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-staff-reportedly-raised-concerns-about-saudi-arabia-deal-for-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-as-company-insists-it-maintains-creative-control\">telling IGN</a> the DLC was \"made possible thanks to the support of local and international organisations [...] through access to experts, historians and resources to ensure the creation of an authentic and accurate setting.\" And those bags of cash in the corner?

Up until now, however, there's been a big gaping hole in the middle of the range—which looks to be filled by the newly-announced direct drive RS50 wheelbase and RS Pedals set.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the 11 Nm G Pro, the RS50 tops out at 8 Nm of torque, a figure that Logitech says was arrived at based on data from their other sim racing products. An 8 Nm maximum is said to be the sweet spot when it comes to the balance between power and driveability, and as someone that's raced with quite a few different direct drive setups at this point, I'd have a tendency to agree.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LtHP2FLKGh853DhhWZtmh.jpg\" alt=\"The Logitech RS50 Wheelbase on a blue gradient background\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UGdxFbvhpZLiRF56yiUxi.jpg\" alt=\"The Logitech RS50 Wheelbase and G Pro wheel on a blue gradient background\"/>\n    <p>The wheelbase itself will be available as a standalone unit starting at $350/€300, and comes with full TrueForce support, which uses game data in combination with audio to approximate some of the details that other direct drive wheels can miss, like engine rumble and precise kerb simulation. Our Jacob was very impressed with the TrueForce experience provided by the G Pro, so using the same system in a more affordable direct drive option strikes as a good idea.</p>\n    <p>However, beyond the base unit itself, you'll still need a wheel and a set of pedals to get yourself started from scratch. The RS50 base will support pre-existing <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steering-wheels/logitech-g-rs-wheel-hub-and-rs-track-wheel-review/\">RS Wheel Hub systems</a> and <a href=\"https://imp.i125364.net/c/221109/795933/11355?subId1=pcg-us-5889834991962989480&amp;sharedId=pcg-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-gb%2Fshop%2Fp%2Frs-round-wheel.941-000232\">RS wheels</a>, or you can buy the base and a wheel/hub combination together as the Logitech G RS50 System for $700, available in either Xbox or PlayStation versions. Both will support PC, though, so take you'll be able to take your pick if you're playing on God's chosen gaming device.</p>\n    <p>As for the foot controls, it'd be worth taking a look at Logitech's other major announcement, the Logitech G RS Pedals. These steel-constructed units look plenty robust, and feature a Hall effect acceleration pedal sensor and a load-cell braking mechanism as standard. Top points to Logitech here, as it's still a major bugbear of mine when pedal sets don't include a load-cell brake by default.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GbSeyfDoTsKUW9CtwZY6Z8.jpg\" alt=\"The Logitech RS Pedals on a blue gradient background\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RggB6uQoYnEKyHwuDTzoY8.jpg\" alt=\"The Logitech RS Pedals on a blue gradient background\"/>\n    <p>There's another clever feature here I'm a big fan of, on sheer design principle alone. The rear of the pedals can be extended backwards to prevent them from tipping over on an unsecured surface, but the tips of the extensions can also be tilted upwards in order to make little feet, which can then be pushed against a rear wall.</p>\n    <p>Sim racing on a desk-based setup is always a bit of a faff when it comes to securing the pedals for heavy braking, so helping them press against the wall behind your desk seems like a nifty solution. They're well-priced, too at $160/$150 for the basic set. You'll pay an extra $45 for a clutch pedal, though, although most sim racers I see these days stick to paddle shifters. Still, I'd say that's a very reasonable sum for the addition.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>In fact, this all looks rather promising. Logitech has a knack for designing good sim racing gear, and the fact that all of this new kit seems very modular means it's quickly building out a direct drive-based ecosystem that might make the likes of <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/fanatec-gran-turismo-dd-pro-review-performance/\">Fanatec</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steering-wheels/moza-r5-bundle-performance-kit-review/\">Moza</a> sit up and take notice.</p>\n    <p>In my experience, all sim racers really want out of a direct drive setup is accurate feedback, robust components, and a straightforward racing experience—so if Logitech can do all that for a reasonable sum, I think it might have another success story on its hands.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rTxS5WgHWFPDRsqLd28vh.png\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair in Royal colouring, on a white background\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1.

Well, Logitech has you covered; it'll just cost you $170. Will that be cash or card?</p>\n    <p>Announced and launching today, the Logitech G515 Rapid TKL is a low-profile analogue gaming keyboard with customisable actuation.</p>\n    <p>This may be the board for you if you know what jiggle peaking is, you like your keys to be small and close to the keyboard, and fancy yourself at the top of the competitive gaming pile.</p>\n    <p>If you don't, well, here's a quick rundown: Low-profile keyboards have keys lower to the base, which allows the entire keyboard to be a little speedier in-game. Being closer to the board means they are quicker to fully depress, and low-profile switches, being less tall, need to travel a shorter distance to reset again. Though actually, with rapid trigger, that reset point doesn't actually matter.</p>\n    <p>In this case, the maximum travel is 2.5 mm, but rapid trigger resets the switch the second you let go, which means in games like Counter-Strike 2, where you are more accurate as you are standing still, this makes your reticle, and therefore your shot spread ever so slightly smaller.</p>\n    <p>All told, the new G515 Rapid TKL is a mere 22 mm high. That makes it 4 mm higher than the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/razers-esports-keyboard-goes-low-profile-with-its-latest-blackwidow-v4/\">Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-Profile HyperSpeed</a> I'm currently typing on and 18 mm lower than the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/asus-rog-strix-scope-ii-96-wireless-review/\">Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96</a>, which is currently our choice for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-keyboard/#section-the-best-gaming-keyboard\">best gaming keyboard</a>.</p>\n    <p>You can customise actuation (how far down you need to press to register a key) all the way from 0.1 mm to 2.5 mm. This means you can make your most commonly used keys easier to press and those you are likely to misclick harder to press.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <table>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Length</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>354.75 mm</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Width</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>146 mm</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Height</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>22 mm</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Weight</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>800 g (without cable)</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Connectivity</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Wired</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Keycaps</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Dual-shot PBT keycaps</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row span=\"2\">\n        <cell>\n          <p>Extra features</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Rapid trigger, key priority, multi-point actuation,</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n      <row>\n        <cell>\n          <p>Price</p>\n        </cell>\n        <cell>\n          <p>$170 | €170</p>\n        </cell>\n      </row>\n    </table>\n    <p>In both look and selling point, the Logitech G515 is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/logitech-g-pro-x-tkl-rapid-review/\">Logitech G Pro X TKL Rapid</a> I tested at the start of the year. Both have rapid trigger and both have the same number of keys (though the latter has a media wheel and the former has a grey accent over WASD). They also come in at the exact same price point. If you are set on rapid trigger and want a Logitech gaming keyboard, this new addition just seems to give a little more choice.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qrM2DdNTuM2hpM4e79qNsg.jpg\" alt=\"Logitech G515 Rapid TKL (in both white and black ) on a purple and black gradient\"/></p>\n    <p>However, if you aren't settled on Logitech and want a low-profile rapid trigger keyboard, we loved the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/nuphy-air60-he-review/\">Nuphy Air60 HE</a>. It's a tad smaller, without arrow keys, a home key, page keys, etc, but also comes in up to $50 cheaper at MSRP. If you just want rapid trigger and don't want a super premium feeling keyboard, the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-keyboards/gamakay-x-naughshark-ns68-review/\">Gamakay X Naughshark NS68</a> is packed with seriously impressive tech for just $40.</p>\n    <p>In exchange for its price, the new G515 Rapid does come with a stainless steel top plate for a more durable design, and the double-shot PBT keycaps are oil-resistant, which should mean it can withstand those long gaming sessions a little easier than others. The analogue switches are pre-lubed for smoother use, and the keyboard comes with a few extra nifty features, such as key priority and multipoint action. Just don't use the former one in Counter-Strike 2, as Valve isn't a fan, ie. it might get you banned.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PcixhTF5rspVfbGSva5CDb.jpg\" alt=\"Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 wireless keyboard\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>1.

Technically, said notice arrived a few days after the 90-day stay’s end – but apparently, the small expiration-notification gap didn’t stem from putting the finishing touches on a settlement.</p>\n    <p>“The Parties’ efforts to reach an amicable settlement have not been successful,” the litigants spelled out. “While the Parties will continue their discussions, they do not request an extension of the stay at this time. “</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>Now, the same parties are working “to promptly and jointly submit” an adjusted case management order, albeit without affecting the current trial date. </strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>As we previously <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/08/26/concord-x-copyright-lawsuit-schedule/\">reported</a>, a partially successful <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/03/06/nmpa-twitter-lawsuit-partial-dismissal/\">dismissal push</a> and a couple discovery hurdles meant that this trial had been teed up for September 2026 even before the stay.</p>\n    <p>Consequently, then, it’ll be a while yet before the suit kicks into high gear. Furthermore, it’s difficult to predict exactly what the copyright-litigation landscape and music’s X presence will look like late next year.</p>\n    <p>Already, quite a lot has changed since the courtroom confrontation <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2023/06/14/nmpa-sues-twitter-music-publishers/\">initiated</a> in 2023 – referring most immediately to the emergence of comparatively pressing copyright suits against gen AI developers.</p>\n    <p>(One smaller-but-noteworthy change: X <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2023/08/07/elon-musk-assumes-control-twitter-music-handle/\">commandeered</a> the @Music handle in August 2023, and the page has been promoting releases from Sony Music artists in particular as of late.

Technically, STUB briefly topped the high-end figure, opening at $25.35 and peaking at $27.89.</p>\n    <p>But as emphasized by multiple market-focused outlets, besides being well below the peak, STUB ended the day down 6.4% and beneath its $23.50 offer price.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, at the time of this writing, after-hours trades were driving a slip from closing – to the tune of a $21.85 price point for STUB. One needn’t be a financial pro to guess how early shareholders feel about the movement, and it’ll be worth monitoring STUB’s showing from here.</p>\n    <h4>Of course, IPO enthusiasm isn’t exactly unprecedented. But at the risk of piling on, StubHub’s <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/02/stubhub-ipo-attempt-2025/\">underwhelming H1 2025 financials</a> should be reiterated now that the public-listing dust is settling – as should analysts’ <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/live-nation-stock-downgraded-september-2025/\">measured assessments</a> of the stock behind Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (NYSE: LYV).</h4>\n    <p>We <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/15/stubhub-ipo-2025/\">covered</a> some not-so-enthusiastic assessments of StubHub’s positioning earlier this week as well. On the financials front, while the company’s half-year results emerged in mid-August, they’re attracting renewed attention in light of the IPO.</p>\n    <p>One example: An X user this afternoon <a href=\"https://x.com/novy_williams/status/1968326872745566668\">noted</a> the astonishing $827.97 million that StubHub reported spending on “sales and marketing” in 2024. That was up from nearly $518 million in 2023.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, different individuals on X, Reddit, and elsewhere are taking the opportunity to voice their longstanding qualms with StubHub. “I hope @stubhub IPO goes terribly today,” a critic penned before alleging that the platform “rips off customers.”</p>\n    <p>As many know, consumer criticism definitely isn’t unique to StubHub. However, its continued prevalence is important on several levels; it seems safe to describe <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/15/ftc-investigating-ticketmaster-live-nation/\">ticketing’s regulatory climate</a> as unfavorable both in the U.S. and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/07/02/ticketmaster-cma-possible-litigation/\">internationally</a>.</p>\n    <p>At the intersection of those points, different ticketing players look to be gaining momentum. Despite <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/08/23/ticketing-upstart-tickpick-250-million/\">pulling down</a> a quarter of a billion dollars in funding just last year, TickPick actually launched in 2011.</p>\n    <p>According to its website, the business in 2022 “[c]elebrated hitting $1 billion in sales.” And per <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C8FLp3lxwgl/?hl=en\">comments</a> from co-CEO Brett Goldberg, TickPick then achieved “close to $1 billion” in revenue during 2024.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/stubhub-stock-debut-performance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Alongside Ozzy and Sharon, children Aimee, Kelly, and Jack Osbourne speak candidly about the <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2020/01/21/ozzy-osbourne-parkinsons-diagnosis/\">late-night fall their father suffered</a> in February 2019 and the subsequent life-changing impact of that accident, which ultimately led to him cancelling his two-and-a-half-year farewell tour.</p>\n    <p>“He was in hospital for weeks. To fall like that and not be able to bounce back like he had in the past, and then having to cancel the tour—that was his biggest heartbreak,” says Aimee Osbourne.</p>\n    <h4>Detailing his numerous corrective surgeries, escalating health issues, and the progressive effects of his Parkinson’s diagnosis, “Ozzy: No Escape From Now” delivers an unvarnished portrait of a man. The film highlights how Ozzy’s ongoing chronic pain impacted his mental health and informed the music he made during this period.</h4>\n    <p>“At that time, the depression was so bad. [He’d] be like, ‘What’s the point in even getting up? I’m not getting up. I’m not working with the physiotherapist. What’s the point?’” says Sharon Osbourne.</p>\n    <p>The singer reveals how “Take What You Want,” his collaboration with Post Malone, instigated by Kelly and producer Andrew Watt and released in October 2019, kick-started a new musical phase in his storied career.</p>\n    <p>“It got me out of the blues. It helped me. That was the best medicine I ever had at that point,” Ozzy says in the film, recalling the recording of the track.</p>\n    <p>Fans are also treated to the inside story of the two albums that followed—2020’s acclaimed Ordinary Man and 2022’s double Grammy-winning <i>Patient Number 9</i>—both of which contain some of Ozzy’s most reflective work.</p>\n    <p>“I took Dad to the studio every single day,” says Kelly, recalling the recording sessions. “He would go into the studio in the basement of Andrew’s house and get comfortable in this chair that Andrew bought him, and it was like the magic would begin.”</p>\n    <h4>“Ozzy: No Escape From Now” was never intended as a posthumous film. However, following his death on July 22, 2025, the documentary now stands as a testament to Ozzy’s courage, wit, determination, and talent—qualities that ensure he remains a powerful figure to millions worldwide.</h4>\n    <p>Alongside the Osbourne family, the film features contributions from bandmates and friends like Tony Iommi (Black Sabbath), Duff McKagan and Slash (Guns N’ Roses), Robert Trujillo and James Hetfield (Metallica), Billy Idol, Maynard James Keenan (Tool), Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Ozzy’s longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde, producer Andrew Watt, Billy Morrison, Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), Mike Inez (Alice in Chains), and Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins). Each provides an intimate, heartfelt perspective on the man himself.</p>\n    <p>“Ozzy: No Escape From Now” is produced by UK production house Echo Velvet, in partnership with the Osbournes and MTV Entertainment Studios. The documentary is executive produced by Bruce Gillmer and Amanda Culkowski (MTV Entertainment Studios), Phil Alexander (Echo Velvet; former Editor-in-Chief at MOJO, Q, Kerrang!), and Sharon Osbourne (Sharon Osbourne Management).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/paramount-ozzy-no-escape-from-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The music industry saw an impressive $560 million surplus during H1 2025, while the broadcasting and video industries clocked in at $360 million. Those numbers are driven in no small part by the <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/29/samyang-kpop-demon-hunters/\">unwavering popularity of K-pop</a> on a global scale.</p>\n    <p>According to the Bank of Korea’s Knowledge Service Trade Statistics, <a href=\"https://www.chosun.com/english/market-money-en/2025/09/17/2KCJ6RAZZNE45B4M3XQYVABGFM/\">released</a> on Wednesday (September 17), the content industry’s trade balance in the first half of the year came in at a surplus of $2.5 billion. Imports recorded $3.28 billion, while exports recorded $2.5 billion. That’s around a 26% increase from the previous record high of $1.98 billion in the second half of 2024.</p>\n    <p>“The content industry has consistently shown growth compared to the previous period, maintaining an upward trend,” said a source from the Bank of Korea.</p>\n    <h4>K-pop megastars like NewJeans, Blackpink, BTS, and scores of others are driving the surplus, with the recent mega-hit <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> fueling the fire. Part of that success comes from a globalized consumer base, with Americans gobbling up K-pop releases. But on the production side, a globalized network of producers, artists, songwriters, and engineers is also fueling the trend.</h4>\n    <p>These ad-hoc, location-agnostic networks are being powered by a number of connected DAWs and collaboration tools that facilitate rapid versioning and quick creative exchanges. “The best collaborations happen when creativity flows freely,” explains Chris Gertz-Rombach, CMO of <a href=\"https://www.ommuse.com\">OmMuse</a>, a top platform for music collaboration and secure storage.</p>\n    <p>“Removing technical barriers makes it easier for artists to exchange high-quality audio and work together seamlessly, regardless of location.”</p>\n    <h4>On the other end of the spectrum, South Korea saw deficits in its knowledge information (-$830 million), advertising (-$130 million), and publishing (-$20 million) industries during the same period. The overall knowledge service trade balance recorded a deficit of $4.53 billion in H1, driven by widening deficits in professional and business services (-$4.48 billion) and intellectual property royalties (-$2.45 billion).</h4>\n    <p>“Payments for technology patent royalties in the manufacturing sector and increased research and development (R&amp;D) outsourcing, along with South Korean citizens’ significant purchases and subscriptions to overseas apps related to gaming, OTT (online video services) and artificial intelligence (AI), contributed to the deficit,” the Bank of Korea explained.</p>\n    <p>However, the information and communication services ($1.96 billion) and cultural and leisure services ($440 million) sectors recorded surpluses. The manufacturing sector (-$2.47 billion) and digital intermediary platforms (-$2.2 billion) posted deficits.</p>\n    <p>Mid-sized enterprises in South Korea recorded a surplus of $930 million, while large corporations incurred a deficit of $3.75 billion. Overall, Asia recorded a surplus of $3.57 billion, as opposed to North America and Europe’s deficits of $3.77 billion and $2.18 billion, respectively.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/south-korea-h1-2025-music-trade-surplus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Their rental Jeep Wagoneer was parked inside a deck on Krog Street while they dined nearby. When they returned, the rear window had been smashed and two suitcases were gone.

Photo Credit: Daniel Hsu</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Earlier this month, Live Nation stock (NYSE: LYV) hit a record high of over $175 per share. But now, as the Ticketmaster parent grapples with a DOJ antitrust action and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/15/ftc-investigating-ticketmaster-live-nation/\">adjacent regulatory scrutiny</a>, Rothschild has downgraded its LYV rating. </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/15/ftc-investigating-ticketmaster-live-nation/\">adjacent regulatory scrutiny</a>, Rothschild has downgraded its LYV rating.</p>\n    <p>Rothschild &amp; Co Redburn (formerly Redburn Atlantic) just recently disclosed its adjusted Live Nation stock outlook. In the appropriate report, the entity settled on a neutral rating (down from buy) and a $170 target (up from $144).</p>\n    <p>While Rothschild doesn’t anticipate that the aforesaid Justice Department suit will result in a Live Nation-Ticketmaster split, it <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/live-nation-downgraded-at-rothschild-on-margin-slowdown-doj-lawsuit-overhang-4240971\">emphasized</a> shares’ “vulnerable” position due to the case.</p>\n    <p>Additionally, Rothschild in more words noted signs of weakening consumer sentiment and the possibility of Live Nation <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/08/live-nation-earnings-q2-2025/\">margin-gains</a> normalization in 2026.</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>Long bearish on Live Nation stock, YR Research took things a step further in its own deep-dive breakdown. </strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>Besides reiterating a sell rating, YR <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823647-live-nation-entertainment-doj-probe-expansion-is-another-risk-the-market-ignores\">voiced</a> growth-slowdown and profitability-fluctuation concerns. The entity also expressed the view that LYV should price in the “high likelihood of tangible structural changes coming out of” the DOJ suit.</p>\n    <p>As highlighted, if the changes are priced in, then they’ve failed to derail LYV’s ascent. At the time of writing, Live Nation stock was down about 1% on the day at $168.52 per share, representing a 30% jump since 2025’s start and a 64% spike from mid-September 2024.</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>Moreover, despite the above-outlined considerations, others believe there’s room yet for LYV stock-price growth. </strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>Last month, Moffett Nathanson <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/live-nation-stock-initiated-with-buy-rating-at-moffettnathanson-93CH-4197601\">initiated</a> Live Nation stock coverage with a buy rating and a whopping $195 target, underscoring the company’s perceived expansion opportunities both domestically and abroad.</p>\n    <p>During Goldman’s Communacopia &amp; Technology Conference earlier in September, Live Nation CFO Joe Berchtold <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/live-nation-at-goldman-sachs-conference-strategic-growth-insights-93CH-4232269\">acknowledged</a> a goal of growing Live Nation’s customer base from 150 million to 200 million. Per the exec, “the mix will be more international than North America.”</p>\n    <p>And on this front, notwithstanding the previously described near-term pressures, Live Nation is definitely plotting a (very) long game with venues <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/06/10/live-nation-building-18-new-venues-in-us/\">in the U.S.</a> and especially <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/12/09/live-nation-building-its-first-music-venue-in-singapore/\">international markets</a>.</p>\n    <p>More broadly, a pile of evidence points to mixed-bag results in live entertainment, where numerous <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/28/field-stream-music-festival-canceled-2025/\">festivals</a> have called it quits and several tours have been <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/01/jp-saxe-tour-canceled/\">shelved</a> or <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/06/16/jonas-brothers-tour-new-dates/\">dialed back</a>.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, some acts are <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/03/katy-perry-lifetimes-tour-ticket-sales/\">still moving</a> a substantial number of tickets, and fans are apparently flocking to <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/09/palm-tree-crew-series-b/\">certain festivals</a>. And though <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/15/the-wizard-of-oz-sphere-residency/\">Sphere tickets</a> aren’t exactly cheap – and Vegas tourism isn’t booming – the Eagles, far from having trouble attracting audiences, have <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/08/the-eagles-add-sphere-dates-in-2026/\">extended their residency</a> into next year.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/17/live-nation-stock-downgraded-september-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I did my last test two weeks ago. It's a thing I have to live with.\"</p>\n    <h2>1980 Wimbledon final 'most satisfying match I played'</h2>\n    <p>Borg first picked up a racquet after his father won one in a table tennis competition.</p>\n    <p>The racquet was too heavy for the young Borg, leading him to develop his unique double-handed backhand.</p>\n    <p>Borg won six French Open titles between 1974 and 1981 and claimed his five Wimbledon titles from 1976 to 1980.</p>\n    <p>His SW19 final in 1980 against American rival John McEnroe - when McEnroe saved seven championship points in a near four-hour epic - is seen as one of the best tennis matches of all time.</p>\n    <p>\"That final was the most satisfying match I ever played. It had everything,\" Borg said.</p>\n    <p>Bjorn Borg wins Wimbledon in 1980</p>\n    <p>Their rivalry was nicknamed Fire and Ice, with McEnroe prone to fiery on-court outbursts and cool Borg barely showing a flicker of emotion during a match.</p>\n    <p>McEnroe would eventually end Borg's Wimbledon dominance in the 1981 final and beat him in the US Open showpiece two months later. Borg retired shortly after the New York defeat.</p>\n    <p>\"We respected each other a lot, all three of us,\" Borg said of his rivalries with McEnroe and Jimmy Connors.</p>\n    <p>\"We were fighting to be the best in the world.

Their carelessness will be a concern for Slot, even if they have shown five times this season that they have what it takes to pull themselves out of trouble.</p>\n    <p>\"A game like this should not have gone to a late winner,\" Slot said.</p>\n    <p>\"I understand that's the story of this game and the last five games, but for me it is a different game than the ones we played before. We had so many great attacks today where we could have scored the third goal.\"</p>\n    <p>Are late winners a problem or perfection for Liverpool?</p>\n    <h2>All eyes on Isak but Salah returns to best</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1440/cpsprodpb/7036/live/4f7a25e0-9413-11f0-bfd9-ed2847759967.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool's new £125m striker Alexander Isak congratulates match-winner Virgil van Dijk at the end of the Champions League win against Atletico Madrid\"/>\n    <p>Liverpool's new £125m striker Alexander Isak showed some nice touches on his debut but will grow in influence</p>\n    <p>All eyes were on £125m British record signing Alexander Isak as he made his Liverpool debut following his move from Newcastle United.</p>\n    <p>He showed some sweet touches but, inevitably, tired before being substituted after 58 minutes. Isak's last competitive club game was on 25 May for Newcastle, so it is understandable Liverpool are handling him with care - and the striker looked rusty.</p>\n    <p>If Isak is the new Liverpool superstar, one of the old guard showed he is not ready to stand aside just yet as Mohamed Salah shrugged off some early season lethargy to return to his brilliant best.</p>\n    <p>He was a constant menace, also hitting the post after Marcos Llorente pulled one back for Atletico.</p>\n    <p>Anfield has a special place in Llorente's heart after he also scored twice when Atletico won 3-2 in a Champions League last-16 tie in March 2020.</p>\n    <p>In the aftermath of that win, Llorente named the dog he gave to his mother 'Anfield', and showed again why this is his favourite stadium with an equaliser nine minutes from time.</p>\n    <p>Liverpool, as is their wont this season, were not to be denied.</p>\n    <p>This time it was Van Dijk who snatched the win for Liverpool - allowing Slot's birthday celebrations to be accompanied by victory rather than a frustrating draw.</p>\n    <h2>Isak eases his way into Liverpool life</h2>\n    <p>Isak, understandably, was some way from his best but showed enough in 58 minutes to give a golden hint to what riches his future may offer.</p>\n    <p>Liverpool were actually 2-0 ahead before Isak got his first touch in a red shirt after 10 minutes and there were anxious groans around Anfield when he was left banging his hand on the turf in agony after Atletico defender Robin Le Normand's late challenge made painful contact with the top of his foot.</p>\n    <p>Isak gradually worked his way into the game, but started to look leggy as the first half came to a close. He came out for the second half, but it was no surprise when he was withdrawn to a generous standing ovation before the hour.</p>\n    <p>Slot said: \"In the 60 minutes he played, he seemed to be quite fit to me. It wasn't as if after 10 minutes he was already very tired. He could play at this level quite well after one or two weeks of team sessions.</p>\n    <p>\"He can play football and he's a joy to watch. That is not a surprise to me. He was fitter than I expected, but the fans can't get their hopes too high. We play three times a week and that's a bit too much for him still.</p>\n    <p>\"We have two great number nines [Isak and Hugo Ekitike] and we're going to use both of them throughout their career here.\"</p>\n    <p>Isak had two shots which brought saves from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak, but the most significant takeaway was his link with another Liverpool new boy, £116m playmaker Florian Wirtz.</p>\n    <p>The pair dovetailed superbly in the first half to create a chance for Jeremie Frimpong, which he could not convert, then Isak's instinctive flick - with his back to goal and without a look - was played straight into the German's path, bringing roars of approval from Liverpool's fans.</p>\n    <p>Isak and Wirtz linked up nine times in the game, this small sample size of their work together suggesting they will be a formidable weapon in Liverpool's armoury.</p>\n    <p>It was a quiet introduction for Isak - but enough to show what he will bring.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cn76dexdgvjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It's clear we are in a position where we do not have the right to react and it is not good when we react.\"</p>\n    <p>However, Simeone was unhappy at what he called \"insults for the whole game\" from the home fans.</p>\n    <p>He added: \"We [managers] are in a position where we are protagonists/standard bearers, so in the same manner that we fight against racism and insults in stadiums today, we could also fight on behalf of the managers, against the insults we receive throughout the whole game.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not easy to be in the position we are in and receive insults for the whole game. I saw it from far away after the third goal. I saw the third goal go in and I turned, the insults continued, and well, I'm a person.\"</p>\n    <p>When pressed on what the nature of the insults were, he responded: \"The truth is I cannot remember exactly. I don't want to enter into the situation.</p>\n    <p>\"The thing I have is that I have to maintain my position. I need to know how to withstand everything that happens in front of the dugout, and know I cannot fix society. I, and whichever manager, has to live with this because it happens all of the time.</p>\n    <p>\"My reaction isn't justifiable but do you know what it is like to be insulted for 90 minutes? I hope Liverpool can improve that aspect and that when they identify the person who did that, there will be consequences.\"</p>\n    <p>The incident came at the end of a frantic match as Liverpool scored twice inside the opening six minutes through Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah, before the Spanish side fought back.</p>\n    <p>Marcos Llorente scored twice for Atletico to level the tie, but the reigning Premier League champions and current leaders rallied to snatch the decisive third goal through Van Dijk's powerful header.</p>\n    <p>Van Dijk header snatches victory for Liverpool against Atletico</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czjvkp7kjwno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I'm a big believer that you get what you put in at some point. I'm just very, very happy that all the persistence has been well worth it,\" Wightman told BBC Sport.</p>\n    <p>\"I felt like I had another gear through the rounds. All I'd said was that I would hit the front at some point. I did not know what would happen and I nearly got there.</p>\n    <p>\"For me this is a gold. Just getting on the start line at a championship final is a gold.</p>\n    <p>\"I went into it with a bit of freedom that whatever would happen, happens.\"</p>\n    <p>'It's been a bleak couple of years, this is like a gold to me' - Wightman on 1500m silver</p>\n    <p>However, there was heartbreak for Kerr, seeking to become only the fourth man to retain the 1500m title but denied the opportunity after pulling up in pain on the penultimate lap.</p>\n    <p>Having positioned himself at the back of the race from the start, he eventually managed to hobble over the line and finished last. Neil Gourley was 10th.</p>\n    <p>Great Britain have had to wait until the fifth day of competition to celebrate success in Japan, where they were set a target of a top-eight finish following a record-equalling haul of 10 medals in 2023.</p>\n    <p>But Wightman's stunning silver lifted them to 17th in the medal table.</p>\n    <p>Former Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford said on BBC TV: \"Everybody suffers with injuries in their careers. Jake Wightman shows that you can come back from it and the good guys do still win medals.</p>\n    <p>\"For anybody young watching this, suffering with something difficult, it shows that you can push through.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published13 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published13 hours ago</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>'It's been very bleak couple of years'</h2>\n    <p>Wightman has endured a long road to return to the position of fighting for the sport's biggest prizes, since his <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/62232323\">crowning moment three years ago.</a></p>\n    <p>But he has always maintained his belief that he would get there.</p>\n    <p>Wightman was accepting that the injury which kept him out of Budapest two years ago was a consequence of the demands of winning world, European and Commonwealth medals in an intense 33-day period in 2022.</p>\n    <p>But his hopes of returning to the global stage at last summer's Olympics were cruelly ended by a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/c10l3yl7485o\">hamstring tear just one week out.</a></p>\n    <p>By that point, he had already been wearing the team's kit at their final training camp in St Moritz.</p>\n    <p>Geoff Wightman reacts to son Jake winning World Athletics Championships silver</p>\n    <p>Wightman sought a refresh this year, making the difficult decision to end his coaching partnership with father Geoff, who was commentating inside the stadium when his son outlasted Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win gold in Eugene.</p>\n    <p>In what has been a year of significant change away from the track, Wightman began working with his partner Georgie's father, John Hartigan, and relocated to Manchester to be closer to his physiotherapist.</p>\n    <p>The only major change in terms of his training, Wightman says, has been to respect his body more.</p>\n    <p>\"Honestly, it has been a very, very bleak couple of years for me. A lot of times I doubted if could make it back to this level,\" Wightman said.</p>\n    <p>\"I have made some huge changes in my life this year. I want to thank my coaching team and my dad for getting me to this point in the first place. He did all the hard work bringing me to this level.\"</p>\n    <p>He added: \"When you get that close you cannot help but think 'what if I had tried a bit more?' But I left everything out there.\"</p>\n    <p>Once again commentating at the stadium where his son celebrated his medal, his father Geoff told BBC Sport: \"Jake could not have given any more there, it was pretty much a perfect race from him. I'm very proud.</p>\n    <p>\"He dipped, which he does not usually do. I have given him a hard time for that sometimes. I hope I have contributed to that as well.</p>\n    <p>\"[His mum] Susan and I are just very proud and we are enjoying the moment with him.

The surroundings are dense with foliage, and the tree features clusters of figs hanging from its branches. The chimpanzee is centrally positioned but partially hidden by leaves and branches. Sunlight filters through the canopy.\"/>\n    <p>The research adds weight to the so-called \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis - the idea that the human appetite for alcohol was inherited from our primate ancestors.</p>\n    <p>This was first proposed by Prof Robert Dudley of the University of California, Berkeley, who is a co-researcher on the study.</p>\n    <p>Scientists were initially sceptical. But more observations of \"scrumping apes\" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team.</p>\n    <p>\"What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years,\" she told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>\"Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2310/live/a6526790-93d9-11f0-9179-45b2a8e0a654.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A chimpanzee in a forested setting, surrounded by dense green foliage.

    "body": "<p>John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president.</p>\n<p>Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n<p>In early March, Swinney said it was \"unthinkable\" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>\n<p>Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question.</p>\n<p>Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to \"ethnic cleansing\".</p>\n<p>But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet.</p>\n<h2>Why has John Swinney's approach changed?</h2>\n<p>The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott.</p>\n<p>Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly.</p>\n<p>The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited.</p>\n<p>So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach?</p>\n<p>That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque.</p>\n<p>\"We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy.</p>\n<p>That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions.</p>\n<p>That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states.</p>\n<p>UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action?</p>\n<p>Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind.</p>\n<p>The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March.</p>\n<p>I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day.</p>\n<p>He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word.</p>\n<p>This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office.</p>\n<h2>Building a new relationship</h2>\n<p>It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were \"thank you\".</p>\n<p>Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words.</p>\n<p>A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney \"nasty\" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built.</p>\n<p>It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections.</p>\n<p>He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again.</p>\n<p>There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government.</p>\n<p>However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known.</p>\n<p>That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a \"terrific guy\".</p>\n<p>It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry.</p>\n<p>He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda.</p>\n<p>Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president.</p>\n<p>He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America.</p>\n<p>But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky.</p>\n<p>The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House.</p>\n<p>He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world.</p>\n<p>None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down.</p>\n<h2>Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal</h2>\n<p>While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential \"win-win\" business deal to Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky.</p>\n<p>A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK.</p>\n<p>Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too.</p>\n<p>If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up.</p>\n<p>If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an \"absolute blinder\".</p>\n<p>One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was \"smart politics\".</p>\n<p>What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge.</p>\n<p>They enabled him to run rings round them.</p>\n<p>The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.</p>\n    <p>As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, the visits are used by governments to further Britain's interests.</p>\n    <p>Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush.</p>\n    <p>However, in February <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxxpxe5qko\">Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles</a> during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal. Sir Keir said the invite was \"truly historic\" and \"unprecedented\".</p>\n    <p>At the time, Trump said it was a \"great, great honour\".</p>\n    <h2>What will Trump do during the state visit and where will he be?</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1265/live/7a349410-93c2-11f0-856b-d5e7e104d2d4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images King Charles and Donald Trump smile as they review the guard of honour at Windsor Castle on 17 September, 2025,  during the US president's second state visit to the UK.

I want to tell you. It's a very special place.\"</p>\n    <p>The couple spent the night at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0x2vxl7gjo\">the US ambassador's residence, Winfield House</a>, in central London. </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Wednesday</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Trump and the first lady flew to Windsor by helicopter, and were greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales.</p>\n    <p>They were then formally welcomed by the King and Queen before joining them in a carriage procession through the Windsor estate.</p>\n    <p>A royal salute was fired in Windsor and at the Tower of London, and the King invited Trump to inspect the guard of honour.</p>\n    <p>After a private lunch with members of the Royal Family, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjedxl0qxyjo\">the president visited St George's Chapel in Windsor</a> and laid a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>\n    <p>They watched a flypast by the Red Arrows, although the aerial display was scaled back because of poor weather so did not feature UK and US F-35 military jets as planned.</p>\n    <p>Later on Wednesday evening, a traditional state banquet was held at the castle, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4l13gxy2lo\">attended by 160 guests</a> including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and Apple boss Tim Cook.</p>\n    <p>Trump spoke of the UK-US relationship, saying \"the word special does not begin to do it justice,\" while the King praised the US president for his \"personal commitment\" to finding solutions to world conflicts.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/870a/live/8b195740-9253-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp\" alt=\"Aerial photo of Windsor Castle with an inset map locating it in relation to London.

A poem to mark the occasion by the former Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy accompanies the piece.</p>\n    <p>The Times leads with \"We are kin, King tells Trump\", adding that the president was \"delighted by pomp\".

A photo of President Trump strolling through a line of bearskin-wearing soldiers with King Charles III not far behind illustrates the \"day of pomp and protests\".</p>\n    <p>The Daily Star takes a jab at Trump with \"keep yer wig on orange manbaby\" as the president's hair is snapped blowing in a breeze. Also on the tabloid's front, the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is \"out of jail\" where he had been serving a sentence for the rape of a 72-year-old woman. Christian Brückner has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case. He denies any involvement.</p>\n    <p>The Mirror leads on the story of the \"Maddie suspect freed\" with a picture of Brückner smoking as he's \"back on the streets\".

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?</p>\n    <p>Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.</p>\n    <p>But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week.</p>\n    <p>They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.</p>\n    <p>The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.</p>\n    <p>And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.</p>\n    <p>After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.</p>\n    <p>But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.</p>\n    <p>There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.</p>\n    <p>Now, here's the important twist.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.</p>\n    <p>But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.</p>\n    <p>The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4dca/live/eb7bf820-93d6-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far. Each year is represented by a line which tracks the numbers from January to December. 2021 saw the lowest of the five years, at 28,526 and 2022 saw the highest with 45,774. As at 8 September the total for 2025 is 30,164 which is the highest for that point in the year of any of the others.\"/>\n    <p>It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win.</p>\n    <p>But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.</p>\n    <p>That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.</p>\n    <p>If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.</p>\n    <p>So where does this decision leave the project?</p>\n    <p>This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.</p>\n    <p>Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.</p>\n    <p>But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.</p>\n    <p>The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".</p>\n    <p>Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road.</p>\n    <p>If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.</p>\n    <p>The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.</p>\n    <p>It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.</p>\n    <p>Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance.</p>\n    <p>The Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas.</p>\n    <p>Israel says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p>\n    <p>The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\".</p>\n    <p>Residents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault.</p>\n    <p>Saad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: \"The drones didn't leave anything.

They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.</p>\n    <p>Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\"</p>\n    <p>Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.</p>\n    <p>Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents, so they returned north.</p>\n    <p>\"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south.\"</p>\n    <p>The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.</p>\n    <p>Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>\n    <p>At least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p>\n    <p>It said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c05ed5rgld3o\">a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City</a> in late August to 154, it added.</p>\n    <p>The UN has warned that an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>.

When pushed on why he had not just tried to pick up the phone or form a relationship, President Lula said: \"I never tried that call because he never wanted to have a conversation.\"</p>\n    <p>Trump has previously said that Lula can \"call him anytime.\" But Lula insisted that members of the Trump Administration \"do not want to talk\".</p>\n    <p>He told the BBC that he had found out about the US tariffs from Brazilian newspapers.</p>\n    <p>Referring to Trump, he said that the US president \"didn't communicate in a civilised manner. He just published them [the tariffs] on his portal - on social media.\"</p>\n    <p>When asked how he would describe his relationship with his US counterpart he simply said: \"There's no relationship.\"</p>\n    <h2>'He's not emperor of the world!'</h2>\n    <p>Lula said that his poor relations with the US leader were the exception, listing how he had built relationships with former US presidents, UK prime ministers, the EU, China, Ukraine, Venezuela and \"all the countries in the world\".</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian president attended the World War Two anniversary celebrations in Russia this year and has not cut ties with President Putin. Asked who he had a better relationship with - Trump or Putin - he defended his ties to the latter, saying they had formed them when they had both been presidents \"in previous times\".</p>\n    <p>\"I don't have a relationship with Trump because when Trump was elected the first time, I wasn't president. His relationship is with Bolsonaro, not Brazil,\" Lula responded.</p>\n    <p>He also said that if he passed Trump at next week's United Nations General assembly he would \"greet him because I am a civilised citizen\", but added that Trump may be \"president of the United States, [but] he's not emperor of the world!\".</p>\n    <p>When approached for comment on Lula's criticism of Trump, a White House spokesperson referred the BBC to the US president's past public comments on Brazil.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6bef/live/eaf52a30-93fd-11f0-88f9-857a462f652e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in a red spotted tie, dark blue suit and light blue shirt, sits in the presidential palace for an interview with the BBC\"/>\n    <p>Lula also spoke about his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted last week.</p>\n    <p>A 4-1 majority of justices on Brazil's Supreme Court found the ex-president guilty of plotting a coup after losing the election to Lula and sentenced him to 27 years in prison.</p>\n    <p>Lula told the BBC that Bolsonaro and his co-conspirators had \"hurt the country, attempted a coup, and plotted my death\".</p>\n    <p>Referring to the appeals Bolsonaro's lawyers said they would lodge, Lula said that he hoped that Bolsonaro would continue \"to present his defence\" but that \"for now he is guilty\".</p>\n    <p>He also criticised Trump for \"inventing untruths\" by claiming Bolsonaro was being persecuted and denouncing what the US leader said was a lack of democracy in Brazil.</p>\n    <p>Lula also told the BBC that if the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot had happened in Brazil rather than in the US, Trump would have been put on trial.</p>\n    <p>In the wide-ranging BBC interview, he also advocated for reform of the United Nations.</p>\n    <p>He criticised the fact that five countries - the permanent members of the UN Security Council - have the power to veto decisions and argued that this tilted the balance in favour of those who won World War Two, excluding nations representing billions of people like Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, as well as African countries.</p>\n    <p>The result, he said, was that the UN didn't \"have the strength to solve conflicts\" and the five permanent members made \"unilateral\" decisions about going to war.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f21b/live/36e48e90-93fe-11f0-88f9-857a462f652e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Vladimir Putin walk through a gold-encrusted palace in Moscow, smiling at one another\"/>\n    <p>He defended his continued alliances with Russia and China – two nations where unfair elections and human rights abuses have been documented – while calling for a more \"democratic\" UN.</p>\n    <p>Pressed on Brazil's continuing purchases of Russian oil while Russia wages war in Ukraine, he said Brazil was one of the first countries to condemn Russia's occupation of Ukraine and that \"Brazil doesn't finance Russia, we buy oil from Russia because we need to buy oil just like China, India, the UK or the US needs to buy oil\".</p>\n    <p>He said that if the UN was \"functioning\" then neither the Ukraine war nor the Gaza war - which he described as \"not a war\" but a \"genocide\" - would have happened.</p>\n    <p>The BBC also asked President Lula about November's COP30 climate summit, when Brazil will host world leaders in the Amazon city of Belém.</p>\n    <p>Domestically, the Brazilian president has faced criticism over his support for exploratory drilling for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n    <p>Brazil's state oil company Petrobas and other firms have bought blocks for exploration and are awaiting licenses.</p>\n    <p>His own environment minister, Marina Silva, has strongly opposed the plans and some conservation groups fear it could risk oil spills in waters close to the Amazon.</p>\n    <p>President Lula insisted Brazil was strictly following the law in its research and if there were any oil spills then \"Brazil would be liable and responsible and take care of any problem\".</p>\n    <p>He added that he supported a world without fossil fuels but \"this moment has not come yet\".</p>\n    <p>\"I want to know of any country that is prepared to have an energy transition and capable of giving up fossil fuels,\" he replied. But the issue has proven controversial with left-wing voters.</p>\n    <p>Lula, who is 79, said he had not yet decided if he would run for re-election in the 2026 presidential elections.</p>\n    <p>He said that his health and his party would determine that – as well as whether it was politically opportune and whether he stood a chance of winning.</p>\n    <p>Lula slipped in the polls recently, but received a boost after Trump imposed tariffs on Brazil.</p>\n    <p>He concluded by saying that his legacy included reducing hunger, lowering unemployment, and the incomes of the working classes growing.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rv981qv4go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Bank rate is policymakers' main tool for controlling inflation.</p>\n    <p>In theory, making borrowing more expensive means people have less money to spend, which slows prices rises. However, increasing borrowing costs can also harm the economy.</p>\n    <h2>Closely-watched vote</h2>\n    <p>The decision to cut the Bank rate in August was taken after an unprecedented second vote by the nine members of the MPC.</p>\n    <p>Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank, said the decision to cut interest rates was \"finely balanced\".</p>\n    <p>Analysts expect Thursday's vote to be more clear cut, with no change expected.</p>\n    <p>The relatively high rate of inflation means policymakers are unlikely to risk pushing that higher by cutting the Bank rate.</p>\n    <p>However, they do expect the inflation rate to start to drop soon, which leaves the possibility open of further interest rate cuts.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/686e/live/91cd6260-93b7-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing interest rates in the UK from Jan 2021 to August 2025. At the start of January 2021, rates were at 0.1%. From late-2021, they gradually climbed to a high of 5.25% in August 2023, before being cut to 5% in August 2024, 4.75% in November, 4.5% in February 2025, 4.25% in May, and 4.0% on 7 August.\"/>\n    <p>The Bank rate has a big impact on the interest homeowners face when taking out a new fixed-rate mortgage.</p>\n    <p>Lenders use the Bank rate to set their own rates. As a result, the expectation of interest rate rises can push up mortgage rates while the expectation of interest rate cuts can pull mortgage rates down.</p>\n    <p>Mortgage rates have dropped very slightly since the MPC's last meeting in August, but further moves are uncertain, according to Rachel Springall, from the financial information service Moneyfacts.</p>\n    <p>\"Many will be waiting with bated breath for the Budget. This waiting game, alongside forecasts for inflation to remain above target, makes it less likely for the Bank of England to make further rate cuts this year,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>She said that savers had seen a downward trend in returns during the time when the Bank has been lowering the Bank rate.</p>\n    <p>\"The average easy access [savings] rate has fallen further below 3%, so savers must act now and switch their variable rate account if it no longer pays a decent return on their hard-earned cash,\" she said.</p>\n    <h2>Global picture</h2>\n    <p>The government would be keen to see interest rates fall further, to boost growth in the UK economy.</p>\n    <p>The Resolution Foundation think-tank, which which focuses on those on low to middle incomes, said living standards needed to improve after a \"lost\" 20 years of growth.</p>\n    <p>But ministers will be aware of the inflationary risk that remains in the UK, especially as prices are rising slower in countries such as the US, Germany, and France.</p>\n    <p>Thursday's MPC decision will come after the US central bank chose to cut interest rates on Wednesday to a range of 4% to 4.25% for the first time since December.</p>\n    <p>Last Thursday, the European Central Bank chose to hold its interest its at 2%.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge2q7wvyz3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Behind her is a well-kept garden with vibrant flowers and green shrubs.\"/>\n    <p>The Home Secretary has vowed to fight \"vexatious, last-minute claims\" after the deportation of an Eritrean man under the UK-France migrants returns deal was temporarily blocked.</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, the High Court granted the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, a \"short period of interim relief\" ahead of his deportation to France, which was sceduled for 09:00 BST on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the High Court decision, Shabana Mahmood said \"last minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable\".</p>\n    <p>The man, who arrived in the UK by small boat last month, argued he was a victim of modern slavery in an appeal made just hours before his flight.</p>\n    <p>In the first High Court challenge to the \"one in, one out\" scheme, the Eritrean man's lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office is set to appeal against the decision and is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to ensure it is not being misused.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood said: \"Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country's generosity.</p>\n    <p>\"I will fight to end vexatious, last-minute claims. I will robustly defend the British public's priorities in any court. And I will do whatever it takes to secure our border.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements. It is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Ministers agreed the \"one in, one out\" <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g2edx410wo\">pilot deal with France in July</a> to curb record small boat crossings this year.</p>\n    <p>The latest setback follows reports that the first flights to France left empty on Monday and Tuesday. Despite this, the first removals of migrants to France under the pilot scheme are still expected to go ahead this week.</p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.</p>\n    <p>France has reportedly said it will only accept a small initial contingent of deportations, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme in an effort to stop small boat crossings in the Channel.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

So, we'll talk to them.\"</p>\n    <p>His comments will be welcomed by Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, who said that tariff relief for British steel is being negotiated.</p>\n    <p>Senior government sources insist there \"remains a path to zero\".</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is \"no mere pageant\" and warned the government that \"we can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past\".</p>\n    <p>An agreement to reduce the tariffs to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July.</p>\n    <p>At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as \"devastating\".</p>\n    <p>However, industry sources told the BBC on Tuesday that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%.</p>\n    <p>One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry.</p>\n    <p>One UK steel producer told the BBC they were \"furious\" about the situation.</p>\n    <p>The company, which has US customers and saw opportunities to increase exports to the country, said it would now struggle to compete with a price advantage over American steel producers.</p>\n    <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.\"</p>\n    <p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UK's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027.</p>\n    <p>The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress.

its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,\" Mr Huang told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but \"what's missing is the AI infrastructure,\" adding: \"We are here to build it.\"</p>\n    <p>AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of \"building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally.\"</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity.</p>\n    <p>\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,\" he told the BBC.</p>\n    <p>\"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs \"putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom\".</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p>But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst.</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be \"over-hyped or under-hyped\".</p>\n    <p>He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\".</p>\n    <p>He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.</p>\n    <p>The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".</p>\n    <p>The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g3dr4n4no\">already announced</a> by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.</p>\n    <h2>Big tech comes to town</h2>\n    <p>Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.</p>\n    <p>The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.</p>\n    <p>Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.</p>\n    <p>The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1ld568v5j4o\">said to be part of trade discussions</a>.</p>\n    <p>But Ms Kendall told the Today programme \"that wasn't part of the partnership\" now agreed.</p>\n    <p>She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e6z590wweo\">major issue for the UK's creative sector</a> - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.</p>\n    <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmek723dz9o\">promised £5bn</a> for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.</p>\n    <p>Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9jyzl4532o\">accompany Trump to a state banquet</a> hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.</p>\n    <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England</h2>\n    <p>The government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r01y04kz9o\">AI growth zone</a>\".</p>\n    <p>It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland - dubbed Stargate UK - from OpenAI, Nvidia, Nscale and semiconductor company Arm.</p>\n    <p>However the UK version is much smaller than OpenAI's US-based Stargate project, launched in January with a commitment to invest $500bn (£367bn) over the next four years building new AI infrastructure.</p>\n    <p>The Tony Blair Institute described the news as a \"breakthrough moment\" but added Britain had some work to do.</p>\n    <p>Dr Keegan McBride, an emerging tech and geopolitics expert at the institute, said that work included \"reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure\" for growth.</p>\n    <p>The Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Additional reporting by Imran Rahman-Jones and Philippa Wain.</i>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.</p>\n    <p>The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.</p>\n    <p>In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was \"an interim judgement on one individual\" which would not halt the deal.</p>\n    <p>\"It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,\" Kendall said.</p>\n    <p>She said ministers never claimed the deal would be \"a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems\" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.</p>\n    <p>Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.</p>\n    <p>\"There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.\"</p>\n    <p>The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.</p>\n    <p>But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had \"very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals\".</p>\n    <p>Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.</p>\n    <p>Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be \"quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats\".</p>\n    <p>She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was \"worth it to have due process and a fair system\".</p>\n    <p>\"It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],\" Townley said.</p>\n    <p>She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an \"overarching problem\" with the scheme's design.</p>\n    <p>Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with \"we told you so\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for \"some tough laws\" and said \"we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country\".</p>\n    <p>Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as \"one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel\".</p>\n    <p>Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.</p>\n    <p>A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.</p>\n    <p>More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.</p>\n    <p>It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea8/live/2959ad80-9338-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far.

That was on top of £10bn the company committed to an artificial intelligence datacentre earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>Other announcements include £3.9bn from the investment firm Prologis and £1.5bn from the tech company Palantir. The government said the package would create 7,600 high-quality jobs in sectors including clean energy and life sciences.</p>\n    <p>Starmer said that “with friends like the US” the UK could “help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off”, adding: “These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious and ready to lead.”</p>\n    <p>Downing Street sources said the £150bn of inward investment was higher than the figure for the whole of last year and that the prime minister was feeling “very upbeat” because it exceeded expectations.</p>\n    <p>The announcement followed a separate pledge of billions of pounds of investment from US tech firms, including from Microsoft, which has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/what-is-new-uk-us-tech-deal-ai-supercomputers-investment-economy\">a $30bn (£22bn) spending package</a> – its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>But the careful choreography was dealt a blow on Wednesday when Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who held one of the most senior roles at Meta until earlier this year, described the US-UK tech deal as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/nick-clegg-multibillion-dollar-transatlantic-tech-agreement-sloppy-seconds-from-silicon-valley\">“sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”</a>.</p>\n    <p>Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said of the US tech companies: “These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway. They’re building datacentres all over the world.</p>\n    <p>“Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.</p>\n    <p>“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal, which is basically just sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”</p>\n    <p>Critics have argued that the tech deal, due to be finalised at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat with Trump on Thursday, does little to support the UK’s homegrown tech industry and have questioned what concessions the government might give US tech companies on regulation and tax.</p>\n    <p>After landing by helicopter in Windsor Castle’s grounds on Wednesday morning, Trump joined the king in a horse-drawn carriage but the procession remained within the royal estate and out of the reach of the public, with security concerns given as an explanation.</p>\n    <p>The president and his wife, Melania, were later hosted by Charles at a lavish state banquet inside Windsor Castle on Wednesday alongside several top business executives including Apple’s Tim Cook, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.</p>\n    <p>They were served Hampshire watercress panna cotta with parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, followed by Norfolk chicken ballotine and a vanilla ice-cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached victoria plums.</p>\n    <p>A whisky sour cocktail garnished with a toasted marshmallow set on a star-shaped biscuit “evoking the warmth of a fireside S’more” was served, although Trump does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    <p>During his speech the king emphasised the importance of protecting the environment, saying the legacy of both nations over the “next 250 years and beyond” was to ensure future generations can experience “natural treasures”.</p>\n    <p>Trump, meanwhile, used his speech to pay a heartfelt tribute to the US’s relationship with the UK, saying the “word ‘special’ does not begin to do it justice”.</p>\n    <p>The US leader also heaped praise on the king, describing his as a “very, very special man”. He went on to say: “We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny. We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Among those in attendance was Rupert Murdoch, who sat next to Starmer’s under-fire chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.</p>\n    <p>The visit, which has been marked by protests involving an estimated 5,000 people in London and a much smaller number in Windsor, comes after two bruising weeks for Starmer that saw him lose both his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and his US ambassador, raising questions about his political judgment and ability to lead his party into the next election.</p>\n    <p>At the Stop Trump Coalition protest in London, the musician Billy Bragg performed songs aimed at the US president featuring the lyrics “you fascists are bound to lose”. The president came to Britain because he “wants to feel like a king”, Bragg claimed.</p>\n    <p>The comedian Nish Kumar launched a blow-up ball with the vice-president JD Vance’s face on it into the crowd. “Donald Trump is a lightning rod [for] white supremacist groups and racists around the world,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Every effort was put on to impress Trump in Windsor but a flypast of F-35 jets above Windsor Castle had to be cancelled due to poor weather and at times the president appeared bored.</p>\n    <p>Trump laid a wreath at the late Queen Elizabeth’s tomb inside St George’s Chapel and he was given a tour with his wife that included Henry VIII’s burial vault and a memorial plate in honour of Sir Winston Churchill. “This was a great honour,” the president said.</p>\n    <p>Trump and his wife also joined the king and queen to inspect artefacts pertaining to British-American relations.</p>\n    <p>“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents about US independence. “That’s fascinating,” said Charles as he pointed out another table, detailing the transatlantic cable used for communication between the two countries. Trump agreed: “That’s so amazing.”</p>\n    <p>Members of the royal family joined the US president for lunch in the state dining room along with the new interim ambassador to the US, James Roscoe, and Trump’s entourage.</p>\n    <p>The president and the king chatted amiably throughout the day but Trump appeared to breach an unofficial protocol by twice touching the monarch’s back.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday, YouGov released new <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53001-how-do-britons-feel-about-the-2025-trump-state-visit\">polling</a> that suggested that more than half of Britons think the Trump presidency has been bad for the UK.

Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</p>\n<p>US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell responds to a question from the media after the central bank announced an interest rate cut. Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</p>\n<p>The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point today, a move that will reverberate across the economy in the coming months. Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at a closely watched press conference about the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Here’s a summary of what happened this afternoon:</p>\n<p>The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point, the first cut since December 2024. Rates are now at a range of 4% to 4.25%.</p>\n<p>Fed economists also released projections, which point to a majority expecting at least one more rate cut by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>During his press conference, Powell said the rate cut was a move toward “risk management” instead of a testament to the strength of the economy. Economists at the Fed are concerned about a weakening labor market, which could see higher layoffs if worsened.</p>\n<p>But Fed officials are still concerned about inflation. Powell said that prices are likely to continue going up toward the end of the year as companies pass along the price of tariffs to consumers.</p>\n<p>A question remains: Will tariff-related inflation be a one-time price increase, or will it be persistent? Powell said economists at the Fed expect it to be more of a one-time price increase but that the Fed’s just is to make sure it’s not persistent.</p>\n<p>With pressure from the labor market and prices, Powell described it as an “unusual” situation for the Fed to manage. “Our tools can’t do two things at once,” he said.</p>\n<p>Powell also took questions about the recent appointment of Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was confirmed by the Senate on Monday. Powell assured that the Fed’s independence is a priority to the entire committee that sets interest rates. And the Fed’s structure offers protection: For a single member to have outsized influence, they need to “make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy… That’s in the DNA of the institution.”</p>\n<p>Powell responded to a question about comments new Fed governor Stephen Miran made at his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Miran said that the Fed actually has a “third mandate”, which is to “moderate long-term interest rates”.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a third mandate is in opposition to how Powell has framed the Fed’s “dual mandate” – balancing unemployment and price increases.</p>\n<p>“We always think of it as the dual mandate,” Powell said, explaining that moderate interest rates come from stable inflation.</p>\n<p>“As far as I’m concerned, there’s no thought of … incorporating that in a different way,” he said.</p>\n<p>Markets appear to be relatively unresponsiveness to the Fed’s highly anticipated rate cut. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are both slightly down for the day, while the Dow is up.</p>\n<p>It’s a stark contrast to last week, when markets shot up at data that showed wholesale prices falling slightly in August, and consumer inflation being within expectations for the month.</p>\n<p>The overall picture that Powell has painted of the economy in his press conference isn’t necessarily one that’s thriving. Powell said that the economy has left the Fed in an “unusual” situation, and said that the Fed’s rate cut is more about “risk management” rather than an testament to a strong economy. The recent rate cut could cause inflation to rise, but risks of the job market worsening under current rates are higher.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen much more challenging economic times from a policy standpoint, the standpoint of what we’re trying to accomplish, it’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said. “There are no risk-free paths now.”</p>\n<p>Powell suggests only 'really strong arguments' not politics can move Fed board decisions</p>\n<p>Powell was, again, questioned about Stephen Miran’s role as both a new Fed governor and Trump’s chair to the Council of Economic Advisor.</p>\n<p>A reporter asked Powell how the Fed can be nonpolitical if one of its voting members is explicitly connected to politics. Powell emphasized that there are 12 voting members and 19 total participants on the board.</p>\n<p>“The only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive, and the only way to do that in the context in which we work is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy,” Powell said. “That’s really all that matters. … That’s in the DNA of the institution, that’s not going to change.”</p>\n<p>A Politico reporter asked Powell how Americans will be able to tell if the Fed, which has historically been nonpartisan, starts to be partisan.</p>\n<p>“We don’t frame these questions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. In another part of Washington, everything is seen through the lens of does it help or hurt this political party, this politicians,” Powell said. “That’s the framework. People find it hard to believe that’s not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We take a longer perspective, we’re trying to serve the American people as best as we can.”</p>\n<p>“I think you would be able to tell. I don’t think we’ll ever get to that place.”</p>\n<p>When asked about Fed governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit against Donald Trump for her firing (a court reinstated her last week), Powell said: “I see it as a court case that I would see as inappropriate for me to comment on.”</p>\n<p>Powell said that Fed officials are expecting inflation from tariffs to be a one-time price level increase, though “we can’t just assume that, [and] or job is to make sure that’s what happens.”</p>\n<p>“We continue to expect it to move up,” Powell said of prices. “Maybe not as high as we would have expected it to.”</p>\n<p>He added that the case for “persistent inflation” is weaker.</p>\n<p>Which is why the Fed cut rates, what he described as a “neutral” policy, given that inflation isn’t out of control, but the labor market has slowed down.</p>\n<p>But Powell acknowledged that it’s “an unusual situation” – the Fed would most likely want to be more careful with rate cuts because of inflation, but has to be wary of the labor market.</p>\n<p>Powell describes labor market as being in a 'curious balance' as demand is down at same time as worker supply dropped</p>\n<p>Powell is again describing the labor market as being in a “curious balance” – a term that he first used in his Jackson Hole speech last month.</p>\n<p>The labor market is balanced out, meaning that the supply of workers is on par with the demand that employers have for workers, but it’s not necessarily a sign of strength.</p>\n<p>Because of immigration, “the supply of workers is coming down”, Powell noted. “At the same time, demand for workers has come down quite sharply to the point where we see what I’ve called a ‘curious balance’.”</p>\n<p>“Typically, when we say things are in balance that sounds good,” he added. “But in this case, the balance is because both demand and supply have come down sharply, now demand is coming down more sharply because we now see the unemployment rate going up.”</p>\n<p>A reporter asked Jerome Powell about Stephen Miran’s appointment, specifically on the fact that Miran is the first Fed governor to also have a role in the executive branch while also serving on the Fed board. Miran is the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.</p>\n<p>“The committee remains united in pursuing our dual mandate goals,” Powell said in response. “We’re strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that, I really don’t have anything to share.”</p>\n<p>Powell holds press conference on rate cut decision</p>\n<p>Fed chair Jerome Powell just started his press conference on the Fed’s rate cut decision.</p>\n<p>As outlined in the board’s statement, Powell said that the unemployment rate, while still generally low, has edged up.</p>\n<p>“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Powell pointed to new immigration policy as a major factor in the labor market slowdown.</p>\n<p>“A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation,” Powell said. “Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant.”</p>\n<p>The median projection for the unemployment rate, which is currently at 4.3%, sees it rising to 4.5% by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Powells also said higher tariffs have begun to push up some prices in some categories of goods, though the full impact have yet to be seen. Price increases due to tariffs could be a one-time price increase or it could lead to “persistent” inflation.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cut interest rates on Wednesday, its first rate cut since December, as the central bank moved to stabilize a wobbling labor market even as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s tariffs continue to push up prices.</p>\n    <p>Rates are now at a range of 4% to 4.25% – the lowest since November 2022. But the decision is unlikely to satisfy Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for acting “too late” and called for a far bigger cut.</p>\n    <p>“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” Fed chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a> said during a closely watched press conference. At the same time, he warned, inflation has picked up.</p>\n    <p>It is “reasonable” to expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to “a one-time shift” in prices, Powell suggested. “But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,” he said. “Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”</p>\n    <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-lisa-cook-firing-court-declines\">Trump moved to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook</a>, claiming she committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary resident on mortgage applications. But Cook has denied wrongdoing, and insisted the president has no authority to remove her.</p>\n    <p>A federal judge and an appeals court have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-lisa-cook-firing-court-declines\">blocked</a> Trump from removing Cook from her post, though the White House has appealed to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court\">supreme court.</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/2rkEP/1/\">Fed rate line chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Amid the fiasco, a separate Biden-appointed Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, suddenly resigned from her post in August. Republicans quickly moved to replace her with Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. The Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\">confirmed</a> Miran on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting”.</p>\n    <p>The dilemma for the Fed is that lowering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates\">interest rates</a> will make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.</p>\n    <p>Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.</p>\n    <p>The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such risks seemed to materialize when federal jobs data for May and June showed the number of jobs added to the economy was revised down by 258,000. Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">Trump’s tariffs</a> have caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025\">estimates</a> that tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.</p>\n    <p>What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?</p>\n    <p>The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\">stagflation</a>”.</p>\n    <p>For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-trade-inflation-tariffs-cbo.html\">told</a> CNBC on Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/us-federal-reserve-interest-rates-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Fresnillo is at the bottom of the leaderboard on weaker precious metal prices.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Trump’s second state visit to the UK is very much dominating the headlines. So far, a $42bn ‘Tech Prosperity Deal’ has been agreed to boost ties between the two nations around AI and technology. Microsoft has promised $31bn in UK investments.</p>\n<p>The Fed is in focus, widely anticipated to cut interest rates for the first time this year, a day after Trump’s attempt to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook was blocked by an appeals court. While the rate cut is already priced in, focus will be on the dot plot for guidance around where rates might go next. Barclays is projecting the Fed will signal three rate cuts by year-end.</p>\n<p>AstraZenecatoday announced disappointing results from a late-state clinical trial of Fasenra in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>\n<p>The drug did not achieve statistical significance in ten of controlling flare-ups. COPD, a debilitating, progressive disease which causes irreversible lung damage, increased hospitalisations and can lead to death, affects 391 million people worldwide.</p>\n<p>Fasenra is currently approved as a treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) in more than 80 countries, including the US, Japan, the EU and china.</p>\n<p>COPD, which remains a leading cause of death worldwide, is a complex, heterogeneous disease and we continue to advance other promising approaches in our pipeline to address the unmet needs of patients.</p>\n<p>With its well-established ability to target and eliminate eosinophils, Fasenra has helped transform treatment of severe asthma, and more recently has demonstrated a significant effect in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome.</p>\n<p>The latter is a rare condition that causes inflammation in small- to medium-size blood vessels.</p>\n<p>The company also reported positive late-stage (phase III) results for a subcutaneous version of its lupus drug Saphnelo, saying the treatment significantly reduced disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to a placebo, and matched the safety seen with the currently approved intravenous version.</p>\n<p>A subcutaneous injection is under the skin and is slower and safer while an intravenous injection is into a vein.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca’s share price fell earlier and was among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 index, but have since recovered and are now up by 0.3%.</p>\n<p>Ofwat sets 'fit and proper' tests for water company directors</p>\n<p>Jasper Jolly</p>\n<p>Water company directors will have to meet new, higher standards for honesty, experience and financial management or face the sack, according to new rules published by the regulator for England and Wales.</p>\n<p>Ofwat said the privatised water companies will have to assess new hires and existing directors each year to make sure they meet standards for honesty, experience and financial management.</p>\n<p>“Fit and proper” tests are widely used across sensitive British industries, ranging from investment managers and broadcasters to the owners of Premier League football teams.</p>\n<p>The regulator could block appointment of directors with unspent convictions, a history of financial mismanagement (including previous responsibility for a bankrupt company) or misconduct - although it is unclear whether the rules would have helped under-pressure Thames Water to avoid the long-running crisis it faces.</p>\n<p>The changes come on top of rules allowing Ofwat to block bonuses for chief executives or chief financial officers if the company has breached environmental rules.</p>\n<p>Emma Hardy, water minister in the Labour government, said the rules were part of “a new era of accountability in the sector”. She added:</p>\n<p>By ensuring that those at the top of water companies meet the highest standards, we are rebuilding public trust, strengthening accountability, and driving change to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good, as part of our Plan for Change.</p>\n<p>Helen Campbell, executive director, delivery at Ofwat said the regulator “will take action where companies fall short”.</p>\n<p>Temu’s UK operation doubles revenues and pre-tax profits</p>\n<p>The UK operation of the Chinese online marketplace Temu doubled revenues and pre-tax profits last year, as British consumers snapped up products offered by the super-budget retailer.</p>\n<p>Temu UK reported revenues of $63.3m (£46.4m) last year, almost double the $32m in 2023, while pre-tax profits similarly surged from $2m to $3.9m, accounts show.</p>\n<p>However, at an operating level, the company, which files under the name Whaleco UK at Companies House, reported losses widening from $7.9m to $8.7m year-on-year. The company put most of its broadening operating loss down to “exchange losses”.</p>\n<p>Because of Temu’s small pre-tax profit, the company paid just $985,000 in UK corporation tax, up from $517,000 in 2023.</p>\n<p>Bold and ‘brat’: M&amp;S bets on womenswear to revive autumn fortunes</p>\n<p>After a cyber-attack rained on its summer, Marks &amp; Spencer is banking on fashion to brighten its autumn.</p>\n<p>A Prada-esque, crystal-embellished, charcoal V-neck cardigan (£46), a faux leather trenchcoat with a price tag of £90 – £6,810 less than the Burberry version – and a £36 short pleated skirt that offers a wearable take on Charli xcx’s “brat” styling will hit shop floors shortly.</p>\n<p>“We can be bolder because, while we continue to dominate in the over-55s, we’ve got new customers in the 35- to 55-year-old age range,” said Maddy Evans, the brand’s womenswear lead, at a showcase of the new collection in the run-up to London fashion week, which begins on Friday.</p>\n<p>The store is relying on womenswear, which has been ticking upward in sales and credibility for two years, to lead a bounce back after a devastating cyber-attack that affected M&amp;S from April to August and is predicted to have cost the business £300m in profits.</p>\n<p>Evans said the retailer was aiming for two-thirds newness in store.</p>\n<p>That basically means that if a customer walks in to see the new season, two-thirds of it she will never have seen before. The other third is core product – white T-shirts, skinny jeans, black wide-leg trousers, pieces that never go out of stock.</p>\n<p>Manchester United hit £666.5m record revenue but lose £33m amid turmoil</p>\n<p>Manchester United have revealed record revenues of £666.5m for last season but still reported a loss of £33m for the financial year. The club were without Champions League football in 2024-25 and finished 15th in the Premier League but their revenue marginally increased by 0.7%.</p>\n<p>Accounts for the year ending 30 June show United’s operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared with the previous 12 months. Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw wide-ranging, and often unpopular, changes at a club he claimed in March had “gone one off the rails” as a business. The British billionaire warned United would have gone “bust at Christmas” if they had not taken “really tough decisions”.</p>\n<p>The chief executive, Omar Berrada, said:</p>\n<p>On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.</p>\n<p>To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United … As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.</p>\n<p>Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by quarter point</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Whether it’s a favourite bar, biscuit or indulgent hot drink, feeding a chocolate habit costs more than it used to.</p>\n    <p>The price of the chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot.</p>\n    <p>Although other price moves meant overall UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\">was unchanged at 3.8%</a> last month, chocolate was a big riser. Alongside hikes for beef, butter and coffee, it helped propel food price inflation back over 5% for the first time in 18 months.</p>\n    <p>At £30 a go, the luxury 1kg jars of giant chocolate buttons sold by gifting brand Cocoba were a casualty of a soaring cocoa price, explains the company’s founder Darren Litton.</p>\n    <p>With cocoa prices more than doubling over the past two years as a result of poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, even something aimed at gift buyers was being priced off the shelf.</p>\n    <p>“We delisted them for a while because we couldn’t even sell them at £40 with the price of everything involved,” Litton says.</p>\n    <p>Cocoa now commands about $7,800 (£5,700) per tonne on international commodities markets from below $3,500 (£2,600) two years ago. The price peaked at more than $12,000 (£8,800) at the end of 2024.</p>\n    <p>The easing price means Cocoba is bringing the jars of giant buttons back for Christmas, but even at £40 Litton says it’s a challenge to make the numbers add up.</p>\n    <p>“The cocoa price is still at a very, very high level but seems to be settling down a bit,” he adds. “We make everything at our factory in Kent. We’ve had to increase prices and invest in equipment to improve efficiency.”</p>\n    <p>Cocoba is a minnow in a market dominated by big names such as Nestlé and Mars but surging ingredient costs have hurt them too. Mondelēz, which owns Cadbury, expects annual profits to fall 10% owing to higher cocoa prices.</p>\n    <p>The squeeze has triggered numerous rounds of shrinkflation, with the Guardian recently revealing that tubs of Quality Street and Celebrations and even some Toblerone bars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/shrinkflation-bites-as-boxes-of-quality-street-and-celebrations-lose-weight\">have shrunk</a> ahead of Christmas.</p>\n    <p>Not much gets past cash-strapped shoppers, who have also raised eyebrows on discovering a KitKat nine-pack is now an eight-pack, and a multipack of Freddos contains four not five chocolates.</p>\n    <p>Alex Lawrence, a retail expert at data company Circana, says higher ingredient costs are being passed on to the consumer. “If you look at the average price per kg for chocolate confectionery it’s up 27% over the last two years, and 12% in the last year.”</p>\n    <p>Britons spent £5.9bn on chocolate in stores in the year to 9 August. Although that figure was up 10%, they actually physically took home less in their baskets.</p>\n    <p>“The quantity we are buying is down 2% year-on-year,” says Lawrence. “People are definitely pulling back in terms of their consumption.”</p>\n    <p>Shop price data compiled for the Guardian reveals the extent of increases over the past two years, with favourites such as Cadbury Dairy Milk or Galaxy costing about 30% more than in 2023.</p>\n    <p>A 110g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk now costs £1.84 on average, which works out at 42p more than in 2023, according to the price analysts Assosia. The equivalent Galaxy bar has gone up by the same amount to £1.79. The data is based on the average pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.</p>\n    <p>The big companies all say the same thing when asked about pack size reductions and price increases. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Mondelēz told the Guardian it continued to experience “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they had done previously.</p>\n    <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p>\n    <p>On the high street, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk\">upmarket Knoops chain</a> sells posh hot chocolates graded by cocoa percentage, with prices starting at £4 for a drink made with a 28% single-origin Colombian chocolate.</p>\n    <p>“It’s been a wild ride for cocoa prices,” says company founder Jens Knoop. It is not just cocoa, he adds that the chain’s matcha bill increased 53% this month.</p>\n    <p>“While there have been increases in our per kilo chocolate price … we have only passed on a small percentage of that to our customers in their chocolate drinks,” says Knoop.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>But while you might treat yourself to Knoops’ most expensive brew – a limited edition 68% single-origin Madagascan chocolate costing £7.90 – on a day out, in the supermarket consumers balk at tubs of instant hot chocolate costing north of a fiver.</p>\n    <p>The price of a 220g jar of Options is up 20% over two years at £5.40, according to Assosia, prompting shoppers to take to supermarket websites to complain. “This is a good product,” writes one. “It used to be reasonably priced £3-£4 Now it is £5.40!!!!”</p>\n    <p>In a similar vein, at £4.50 a 500g tub of Cadbury hot chocolate costs a fifth more than it did in 2023.</p>\n    <p>Shoppers also complain that other price changes take the biscuit. At £2.25, a 266g pack of McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives costs 35p more than two years ago. Meanwhile a 130g pack of Fox’s milk chocolatey rounds is now £2.30. The same pack cost £1.87 two years ago.</p>\n    <p>The increases are also notable on supermarket own-label chocolate digestives – which provide a cheaper alternative to the big brands – with a 300g pack now £1.12, up from 85p two years ago.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink inflation could hit 5.7% by the end of year, up from August’s reading of 5.1%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food\">Food</a> and Drink Federation.</p>\n    <p>Karen Betts, the trade body’s chief executive, says rising food prices were previously down to energy and commodity shocks, but now government policies – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/reeves-defends-40bn-tax-increase-in-autumn-budget-as-businesses-prepare-for-nics-hike\">April’s increase in employers’ national insurance contributions</a> – were a driver.</p>\n    <p>“The costs are such that companies can no longer absorb them and are having to pass at least some of them on to consumers.”</p>\n    <p>Needless to say it’s a difficult environment for small companies such as Temprd, which makes “properly chunky” chocolate bars, in flavours such as lemon and blueberry cheesecake.</p>\n    <p>When Rob Anthony started the Essex company with his brother five years ago he was aware that its premium bars looked expensive compared to “run of the mill” chocolate. “At that time our bars were probably around £3 per 100g. Now they are £4.50.</p>\n    <p>“We had to make two jumps, from £3 to £3.75 and then to £4.50, so two price rises in the last four years,” he says, but is hopeful the worst is over.</p>\n    <p>“There might be a [cocoa] surplus this year, because demand has fallen, and production has been quite good. We’re fairly confident we can survive through from now to next Easter without having to put our prices up.”</p>\n    <p>As the brands sold in supermarkets become more expensive Anthony suggests people are becoming more circumspect.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t changed the recipe,” he says. “We haven’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">skimpflated</a> our product or changed the size. We just put the price up to cope with price increases. People are willing to spend more less often to buy a luxury product … they feel they’re getting better value for money.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/chocolate-inflation-consumers-spend-more-but-get-less-prices-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The cost of air fares was the main downward driver, while prices rose for petrol and diesel. The cost of hotel accommodation also fell by less than this time last year.</p>\n    <p>Food price inflation climbed for a fifth consecutive month, up from 4.9% in July to 5.1% in August, with small increases in a range of vegetables, cheese and fish items. The price of chocolate rose by 15.4%, while the cost of beef, butter and coffee also increased sharply.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">facing intense scrutiny over Labour’s economic management</a> amid widespread speculation about tax increases in her autumn budget, which is expected on 26 November.</p>\n    <p>Business groups said the chancellor’s 2024 autumn budget measures, including the £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a>, would force them to cut jobs and raise prices.</p>\n    <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “With borrowing costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">hitting a 27-year high</a>, working people and businesses are bracing for even more tax rises to pay for Labour’s mismanagement.”</p>\n    <p>Reeves said the government was taking action to help households. “I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.”</p>\n    <p>The Bank forecasts inflation is on track to peak at 4%, with the potential to delay further interest rate cuts. Threadneedle Street has cut borrowing costs five times since summer 2024.</p>\n    <p>City economists said there were some signs that inflationary pressures were beginning to abate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> for consumer services, which is closely watched by the Bank, slowed to 4.7% from 5% in July. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food and tobacco prices, fell to 3.6% from 3.8%.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Inflation has come down from a peak of 11.1% in the second half of 2022, the highest rate in four decades, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuelled an increase in the price of energy and food.</p>\n    <p>Although the headline rate has fallen back, households have come under renewed pressure after a rise in taxes and regulated utility prices in April, including for energy and water. Threadneedle Street has also expressed concern over fast-rising food prices, which hit lower-income households hardest.</p>\n    <p>Economists say that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/28/climateflation-could-push-up-uk-food-prices-by-more-than-a-third-by-2050-report-says\">extreme weather conditions are pushing up food prices</a>, as the climate emergency causes more droughts and floods, affecting harvests around the world. UK food manufacturers and retailers said government regulations and taxes were also having an effect.</p>\n    <p>Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, urged the Bank to cut rates to ease pressure on workers, arguing that high borrowing costs would have little impact on price increases due to global challenges.</p>\n    <p>“Keeping interest rates high will not bring down these prices – but instead, rates are adding to the pain for families and businesses,” the TUC boss said.</p>\n    <p>Official figures on Tuesday showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">the jobs market cooled in July</a>, while economic growth remains weak, adding to pressure on the Bank to consider a cut in rates. The ONS will provide updated figures for retail sales and the government finances on Friday. However, analysts said concerns remained over stubborn inflation.</p>\n    <p>Martin Sartorius, the principal economist at the CBI business lobby group, said: “The monetary policy committee [MPC] looks set to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow and, going forward, the MPC faces a delicate balance between signs of a cooling labour market and the risk of price pressures remaining stubbornly high.”</p>\n    <p>UK inflation is running at the highest rate in the G7, outpacing a 2.9% headline rate in the US. The rate is also significantly above the eurozone’s 2.1%, and flash estimates for France (0.8%) and Germany (2.1%), for August.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p>\n    <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p>\n    <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p>\n    <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p>\n    <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p>\n    <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p>\n    <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p>\n    <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow.

The only real question mark here is the power button, which is mysteriously underneath the system, so you need to pick it up to turn it on.</p>\n    <p>You'll have to make some compromises when it comes to ports, but it's probably not nearly as bad as you're thinking. The front has two USB-C ports with USB 3.0 support, as well as a 3.5-mm headphone jack for easy access. Around back you'll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus an HDMI connection for your monitor, Ethernet, and power, with USB-A now totally removed from the equation. If you leverage all the ports, you can connect up to three external displays, with support for resolutions up to 6K, depending on your configuration.</p>\n    <p>There are two discounted models, but there's really only a minor SSD storage size difference between the two.

For over-ear headphones, I'd try to keep them as dry as possible when cleaning, but using a wet rag or brush to clean them shouldn't be a major issue, as long as you avoid areas like charging ports.</p>\n    <h2>Get New Pads or Tips</h2>\n    <p>Most brands, <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2gRdHG7pk8rK19d8NiAvLLPFrYNJbt146BLuYPtvm32K793WpCvu1y6kMQ8htezMXRhZ4HXQehfxQGdSGjETJ4XRVSbVCZG4ibBzcM9c3qRRhoWVou5Kfk5YUBGZTCgqTFiaD8Tgk9xrzd1UKFuwakDkVzGPqbbMAH2WscEBqWgPqoLFRHCZsZWgmHT4XWnEMA1m4YpLRcwMmNvgRA7SZ3K6gykNwWA6FMwsYhYEnhfozVktP8oDkAqYmTQksKmUZs9agHmryNxxGzfaip668nKyrMjQFEQP6hCZ5qABLhPFCAeASq7CQGWTauLDuvbccoMpvQo27bBuGyKHTjwLdqtKuvSgD6Gjk8DnUWDjW\">Apple included</a>, offer replacement eartips and pads for their headphones, which can really make an older pair feel new again, especially if the foam is collapsed and dirty. I recommend changing pads as soon as you notice extra pressure or a lack of quality sound isolation. Eartips I just replace as they get deformed over time, or as I lose one.</p>\n    <p><i>Power up with unlimited access to</i> WIRED<i>.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n    <p>The primal urge to sit in front of a fire is in our DNA. That might be the reason I’ve typed “vintage electronic fireplaces” into <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/search/vintage?q=electronic+fireplaces&amp;ref=search_bar&amp;vintage_rewrite=vintage+electronic+fireplaces&amp;original_query=2&amp;orig_facet=\">Etsy’s</a> search bar on more than one occasion. There’s <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/147470491401200509\">evidence</a> that fires can lower our blood pressure and induce relaxation as “part of a multisensory, absorptive, and social experience.”</p>\n    <p>I’ve sought that elusive object of desire: an affordable freestanding ventless fireplace that can give my apartment the majestic warm glow that only a fireplace can deliver. For those of us who cannot retrofit our homes, change building codes, or persuade a landlord to build a chimney, the options for more than a simulacrum of the crackling fireplace are here.</p>\n    <p>And going ventless isn’t just about cost; there are quantifiable health risks to living with an actual Yule log. It’s well established that wood-burning fireplaces negatively impact both indoor quality and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-need-an-outdoor-air-quality-monitor/\">outdoor air quality</a>. A 2020 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896971935764X\">study</a> published in Science of the Total Environment found that “long-term exposure to PAH levels measured in the fireplace room may contribute to the development of cancer.” <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons\">PAHs</a> are Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that occur during “the incomplete combustion of organic material”—think tobacco, coal, gasoline, and wood. PAHs are among “the 189 hazardous air pollutants covered under the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/haps/initial-list-hazardous-air-pollutants-modifications\">Clean Air Act</a>.”</p>\n    <p>A 2023 <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023004014\">study</a> found that “increasing frequency of wood-burning indoor fireplace/stove usage was associated with incident lung cancer, even among never smokers.” <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00035#\">Residential wood-burning fireplaces</a> can increase levels of cancer-causing PAHs in local outdoor air pollution by orders of magnitude. Even though wood is renewable, it is not always eco-friendly.</p>\n    <p>Could there be an affordable ventless fireplace that won’t increase cancer risk or speed up the earth’s demise? Possibly. There are two main types of freestanding, no-installation-required, ventless fireplaces on the market: The gel fuel kind that creates a real flame, and LED light models that produce a real flame moving image. I tested one of each, below, to give you an idea of what to expect.</p>\n    <p>For more warmth, check out our related guides, including <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-space-heaters/\">Best Space Heaters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-fire-pits/\">Best Smokeless Fire Pits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-down-comforters/\">Best Down Comforters</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-heated-blankets/\">Best Heated Blankets</a>.</p>\n    <h2>In Summation</h2>\n    <p>There are significantly more cons with gel fuel fireplaces than there are with LED light models. For one, the gel fuel models can explode, killing or causing life-changing injury to the user. <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@birenlawgroup\">Biren Law Group posts regularly on TikTok</a> about the dangers they’ve seen in home fires involving gel fuel. As for LED models, the biggest issue is sound. If you miss the crackle sounds that come with fireplaces, the LED models might be too fake for your liking.</p>\n    <p><i>Power up with unlimited access to</i> WIRED<i>.

Features like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-watch-series-8-and-apple-watch-se/\">Low Power mode</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-watch-series-10/\">faster charging</a> help you keep the watch on your wrist for longer, but Apple has not significantly improved the watch’s 18-hour battery life—even at last year’s much-hyped <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-turns-10/\">decade-versary of the Apple Watch</a>.</p>\n    <p>I say this to give the context of why such a little thing was so shocking. After wearing the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-series-11-se-ultra-3/\">new Apple Watch Series 11</a> for a full afternoon and wearing it to sleep, I woke up in the morning and discovered that I still had 58 percent battery left. 58 percent! I can wear the watch to sleep, get up, get my kids to school, and charge the watch when I’m at my desk! Constantly fussing over battery life was a major pain of the Apple Watch, and it’s been fixed.</p>\n    <p>Longer battery life also makes it significantly easier to use Apple’s newest health features as well. If you have a Series 3 or 4 and have been waiting to upgrade, this is the year to do it. Too bad Apple couldn’t pull this off last year.</p>\n    <h2>In a Heartbeat</h2>\n    <p>First things first: The new Series 11 comes in 42- and 46-millimeter case sizes with aluminum and titanium finishes in a variety of colors—Gold, Natural, and Slate for titanium, Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Jet Black for aluminum). It has the same slim case as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-watch-series-10/\">last year's Series 10</a>, along with features like fast charging and a new, more scratch-resistant glass.</p>\n    <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has long contended that the Apple Watch is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-tim-cook-wants-apple-to-literally-save-your-life/\">meant to save your life</a>. In accordance with this, the newest features on the watch (or more accurately, the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/top-new-features-in-watchos-26/\">watchOS 26</a> update that applies to all <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-apple-watch/\">Apple Watches, Series 6</a> or later) are health-related. First, the watch now offers hypertension, or high blood pressure, notifications.</p>\n    <p>Undiagnosed high blood pressure now affects as many as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/high-blood-pressure-is-the-worlds-biggest-killer-now-theres-a-plan-to-tackle-it/\">one in three people worldwide</a> and can lead to heart attacks, stroke, or other long-term health conditions. The optical heart rate monitor on the watch purports to check how your blood vessels respond to your heartbeats; Apple says that the feature was developed with data from a series of studies that totaled over 100,000 participants.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/apple-watch-series-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This coupon is stackable with other promotions too, so you can still take advantage of the many other featured discounts.</p>\n    <h2>When to Get the Best Discounts on LG of the Year</h2>\n    <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are often the biggest times to save on LG gear, but the brand has promotions going all year. Last year’s LG TV models like the C4 and G4 are both on sale right now, as again the company clears out stock for 2025. Those are frankly the best deals you’ll likely see this year, including Black Friday, but if you’re not interested in last year’s models, there are already some discounts on the next wave.</p>\n    <p>LG’s new evo <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/ces-2025-photo-gallery-day-3/\">G5 OLED TV</a> is poised to be one of the brightest, most beautiful TVs released this year. I saw it in person at CES 2025, and from my brief time with it I can already tell you its new quad-stack panel is a scorcher that keeps the perfect black levels and fabulous colors for which LG OLED TVs are praised. They’ve rolled out their latest version, the <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled77g5wua-oled-4k-tv\">OLED evo AI G5 4K Smart TV</a>, enhanced with AI for more personalization, an ultra crisp picture, and even less lag time. On top of up to $400 off, get free professional wall mounting, a free $200 TV stand, and $200 off when you bundle with a matching soundbar.</p>\n    <p>Looking for something for the kitchen or laundry room? You could save $200 on <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/promotions/washer-dryer-savings\">select Heat Pump laundry bundles</a>, or up to <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/promotions/best-sellers\">45% off on LG’s best-selling appliances</a>. There are plenty of other ways to save, so if you’re excited to get your LG on, check out these deals now.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lg-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n<p>Amazon Prime Day is one of the most confusing shopping holidays in existence: It’s rarely even a “day,” since in the past it has run from two to four days long. We closely track <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/prime-day/\">the best Prime Day deals</a>. Amazon promises “millions of deals”—but the displayed discounts are often misleading, and while it’s advertised as a members-only event, some deals are available to people who don’t subscribe to Prime. Add in the frenzy of limited-time Lightning Deals and you’ve got a recipe perfect for spending too much money.</p>\n<p>Fear not! We’re here to help. WIRED’s Reviews team is familiar with common shopping pitfalls, and I’ve been a deals writer for over a decade. What time do sales start and end? How do you tell whether a deal is <i>actually</i> a deal? We pooled our collective expertise to get you prepared for the latest <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RxYrVJ2FDJxYNvUJZKwdHNii7oUf121vZmmC2obyKYThhxX9Zge8EtsvKbihya1EThi46ksf5YhBUaskheQnEsLhPcw2xXUU1rPbxZyF7Kt4xzofcrrtnNtb6ZNYUPjb9WHm5L9mgETYwygcGfYpVQav2Hb7YxbxfDaLDsH84NaXHwjnBPJ544FmUouX8wW8S2WuJP8KHeR1GWeudrUJa3m1h5nwUVh6B3456TFAmTwxu1KbNhCwA4wGvoNJRZeoprRT7pdhwGXJjpyLxFoefU7oSFnccGescErPx5cA9AYVQUVAp7uBngwEjgcCoS\">Amazon Prime Day</a>, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, October 8 and 9.</p>\n<h2>When Is Amazon Prime Day?</h2>\n<p>Amazon Prime Day has a main sale in July and a secondary sale—previously called “Prime Big Deal Days”—that tends to fall in October. This year it will be on October 8 and 9.</p>\n<h2>When Do Prime Day Deals Start?</h2>\n<p>The event always kicks off at 3 am Eastern time (midnight Pacific). WIRED will cover the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/prime-day/\">best Prime Day deals</a> from both Amazon and retailers that have competing sales.</p>\n<h2>Are Prime Day Deals Only for Prime Members?</h2>\n<p>Officially, yes. You need to be an Amazon Prime member to shop the Amazon Big Deal Days event. There is a <a href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EbxtFkHZLuQbEbvDkgXWVoGAx9jK4wgSwivMenZw1TP467SQdJ1F3KSoRj94NrjKL7ACsVVUsMWQDsoG956PNXHbjcfu3mYTPHbTHPDaqpzqgavKXuKQH8tkKzveoKbsCyCqeoHF8vSSXizv6C9Uma3ByKoVzHbMExdgLVmdkEG2GEMEBsLmEqasBfxYStBKZB3mcjNTB2af3vTxw1py9jS4KiiZja2Q6joXaJZMQfctcyBYh6Bjh86dMc2Fyvvf5PyRGs7Q3YBHu1QsMy4uRC1j9nfXJgJg3CNK7ZubFum2fBv9Wtn5GbGAoXdchAavUeKGgjM85GBJ5xSjHYGx\">free 30-day trial available</a> for new accounts. (Prime membership comes with a lot of perks, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-prime-perks/\">we've rounded up all of them here</a>.) The trial will let you get in on the sale—just remember to cancel your membership to avoid any subsequent $14 monthly renewal charges.</p>\n<p>There are usually some discounts available if you're not a subscriber (although those deals might not be that great). Other major retailers like Best Buy and Walmart usually hold concurrent sales during Prime-exclusive sales events. The prices are often close to what Amazon is offering on the same products, and sometimes the competing sales match the Prime Day price. This is a good way to take part in the sale if you <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-will-jeff-bezos-wedding-impact-venice/\">object to shopping on Amazon</a>.</p>\n<h2>Is Prime Day Worth It?</h2>\n<p>It depends. For some items, Prime-exclusive event prices tend to be among the lowest we see all year. That's especially true for Amazon hardware, like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-kindle/\">Kindles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-amazon-fire-tablet/\">Fire Tablets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-4k-streaming-devices/\">Fire TV Sticks</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-alexa-and-amazon-echo-speakers/\">Echo devices</a>. The kicker is that prices on nearly everything fluctuate throughout the year, and some products are discounted on a frequent basis. Even if the price is good, a deal on a product that goes on sale all the time diminishes the overall quality of that offer.</p>\n<p>The sheer volume of deals promoted by Amazon during sales like Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days is a blessing and a curse. The truly standout discounts can be difficult to pinpoint—there's so much stuff on sale that the big picture can feel overwhelming. But if you're in the market for something specific, there's a good chance the item you want will be discounted. We've seen some fantastic Prime-exclusive discounts in the past, ranging from dirt-cheap Kindles and video doorbells to elusive price drops on gaming consoles or office furniture. The tricky part is to find the diamonds in the rough.</p>\n<p>WIRED covers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/category/gear/deals/\">legitimately good deals</a> all year long, including during Prime Day. Our policy is to only cover deals on products someone from our team has personally used, to avoid promoting cheap junk. Maybe it'll be a product we've reviewed, or maybe it'll be a product we use in our day-to-day lives. We also only cover actual deals—if the price isn't lower than it normally is, we don't include it. We aim to provide pricing context as well. Our tips below will help you find those great discounts on your own—in the same ways that we would. No gatekeeping here.</p>\n<h2>How Do I Know Whether a Deal Is Good?</h2>\n<p>ABC: Always be checking (prices, that is). Researching an item's price is the most important aspect of determining the quality of a discount. Don't fall prey to deceptive marketing language and inflated MSRP prices—our tips only take a few moments. The easiest step is to take a second to Google the items you're considering so you can see the price across multiple stores.</p>\n<p>One tool we like to use is <a href=\"https://www.camelcamelcamel.com\"> Camelcamelcamel</a>, which tracks Amazon's prices over time. Paste the Amazon link or ASIN (found in the Product Information section on the Amazon product page) into Camelcamelcamel's search bar and you'll be able to see an item's lowest recorded price, its average price, and how frequently the price fluctuates. Some deals, such as Lightning Deals, are excluded from the pricing history, but it works for most items. It's useful to see what an item has sold for in the past. And while Amazon's Rufus chatbot has </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-rufus-price-check/\">price history information</a>, it isn't always reliable and often misses context (as evinced by our personal testing). We also like</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-prime-day-2025-tips-to-find-best-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n    <p>Lenovo is currently the biggest PC and laptop company in the world, and they just so happen to make some of our favorite laptops and PC peripherals. In fact, our list of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-laptops/\">the Best Laptops</a> you can buy include a number of Lenovo devices that we’ve tested and fully recommend, ranging from high-end premium laptops to options for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cheap-laptops/\">budget-minded</a> shoppers. If you are looking to save a few bucks while shopping for a new Lenovo product, here are the Lenovo coupon codes and special offers you need to know about.</p>\n    <h2>Save Big With This Lenovo Coupon Code (Plus Other Great Fall Tech Fest Deals)</h2>\n    <p>Fall is (basically) in the air, as are big discounts at Lenovo. During the Fall Tech Fest event (running through September 29 at 3 AM EST), you can save big on doorbuster deals, like $810 off the ThinkPad P16 Gen 2 Intel (16″) Mobile Workstation. And when you use Lenovo promo code <strong>BUYMORELENOVO</strong>, you can save $15 on purchases of $500 to $750; save $25 on purchases of $750-$1,000; save $40 on purchases of $1,000-$2,000; and save $100 on purchases of $2,000 or more, through September 22 (at 3 AM EST).</p>\n    <h2>Score Weekly Tech Deals, Price Match Guarantee, and Free Shipping</h2>\n    <p>Beyond the 4-Day Sale deals, Lenovo has a number of other current offers available when shopping through <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/\">Lenovo.com</a>. There are weekly deals on PCs and tech that include free shipping with no minimums. For certain products, you can even choose to buy online and pick up in-store at Best Buy. If you’re looking for more Lenovo recommendations, we’re big fans of the <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/idea-tab-series/lenovo-idea-tab-pro/len103l0026?IPromoID=LEN999994#models\">Lenovo Idea Tab Pro</a>, an Android tablet that’s currently on our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-tablets/\">Best Tablets</a> list. It’s currently discounted by 26%, bringing the price down to $280.</p>\n    <p>Lenovo is also offering price-matching on any comparable PC, including from many online retailers. That’s really helpful, as it’s not uncommon to see price discrepancies between different retailers.</p>\n    <h2>Get Exclusive Savings With Lenovo Discount Programs</h2>\n    <p>Lenovo does offer a fairly generous <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/discount-programs/\">discount program</a> for certain demographics as well. These include a 5% off Education, Healthcare, First Responder, and Senior (over 55) discount.</p>\n    <p>You can use this discount on anything you find at <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/\">Lenovo.com</a>, which includes a lot more than just Lenovo-branded laptops. For example, Lenovo sells one of our favorite <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/discount-programs/\">laptop docking stations</a>, the Kensington Triple Video Mobile Dock. Despite its tiny size, this tiny device can power up to three 1080p (or two 4K) displays simultaneously. It’s a great example of the wide diversity of products you can use these discounts and coupon codes on.</p>\n    <h2>Enjoy Perks When You Join My Lenovo Rewards</h2>\n    <p>Lenovo has a <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/rewards/\">My Lenovo Rewards system</a> that can earn you points that can be spent on future purchases from <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/\">Lenovo.com</a>. Almost everything you buy gets you between 3% and 9% back in the form of reward points, and you can start redeeming points right after signing up for an account. 1,000 points is equal to $1 that you can spend on future purchases. On top of this, you’ll benefit from frequent sweepstakes, exclusive member-only savings, birthday rewards, free expedited delivery, and more. Sign up today—it’s free.</p>\n    <h2>Lenovo Financing and Lease-to-Own Options</h2>\n    <p>Lenovo uses <a href=\"https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/landingpage/lenovo-financing-options\">Katapult to offer financing and lease-to-own options</a> on its laptops. That might be useful if you’ve been eyeing one of Lenovo’s higher-end laptops. One of our favorite of these is the Lenovo Yoga 9i, a gorgeous 2-in-1 with a bright OLED screen and a luxurious design. This laptop is currently listed as one of our top recommendations for the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-laptops/\">Best Laptops</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-2-in-1-laptops/\">Best 2-in-1 Laptop</a>.</p>\n    <p>Katapult allows you to buy now and pay over time, without charging late fees. If you put down a $45 initial payment, you can check out the laptop today. Katapult offers up to $3,500 in pre-approved leases and allows you to make minimum payments over time or buyout early.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lenovo-coupon-code/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Photo Credit: LimeWire</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>The Fyre Festival story isn’t over yet: LimeWire has officially acquired the “controversial” brand with an eye on “saving one of the internet’s most infamous cultural memes from extinction.” </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>The revamped LimeWire formally <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250915990798/en/LimeWire-Acquires-Fyre-Festival-Brand-What-Could-Possibly-Go-Wrong\">disclosed</a> the purchase today, about two months after Fyre Festival auctioned its name, trademarks, domains, social handles, and more <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/357251347049\">on Ebay</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the end, that auction attracted 175 bids, the listing shows – the highest, $245,300, having evidently come from LimeWire. But it wasn’t until now that the buyer, which left its well-known piracy origins behind with a 2022 relaunch, stepped forward.</p>\n    <p>(Out of the gate, LimeWire’s post-relaunch <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/04/21/limewire-lmwr-token-sale/\">focus</a> was on NFTs, but the company proceeded to spearhead multiple gen AI <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2023/12/13/limewire-unveils-ai-powered-audio-workstation/\">expansions</a> in 2023. As things stand, the platform is working “to reshape the way people create, edit and transfer files globally,” according to its website homepage.)</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>And </strong>\n      <strong>on social media, </strong>\n      <strong>the development is prompting a number of conversations and questions. Chief among the latter: Is the deal real, and what, exactly, does LimeWire intend to do with the brand?</strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>On the former front, the answer appears clear enough: LimeWire has now taken over Fyre Festival’s Instagram and X profiles, established a fresh webpage for the brand, embraced comparisons with its own comeback, and rolled out a waitlist for future Fyre updates.</p>\n    <p>Regarding LimeWire’s Fyre plans, the good news is that another festival doesn’t seem to be in the cards. (As many will recall, a <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/04/16/fyre-festival-2-postponed-all-tickets-refunded/\">second stab</a> at organizing a Fyre Festival event came up short earlier in 2025.)</p>\n    <h4>Actually on the way, however, is “a reimagined vision for Fyre,” with a focus on moving “beyond the digital realm” and “into real-world experiences, community, and surprise,” per LimeWire.</h4>\n    <p>“Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history,” summed up LimeWire co-CEO Julian Zehetmayr. “We’re not bringing the festival back – we’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches.”</p>\n    <p>Fans should “expect the unexpected,” LimeWire continued, with the forthcoming revival expected to be “bold, self-aware, and impossible to ignore.”</p>\n    <p>Closer to the present, LimeWire has already started pushing a Fyre merch collection– including t-shirts ($50 a pop), a beach towel ($75), and an $85 hoodie. Time will tell whether these items move and whether the overarching acquisition pays off for LimeWire – which is, admittedly, enjoying a coverage boost due to the Fyre buyout.</p>\n    <h4>As for the individual on the opposite side of the transaction, Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland is excited about the future of the brand as well as his newly launched venture, PHNX.</h4>\n    <p>PHNX proper bills itself as a tech and marketing platform that deals in monetizing digital views via content campaigns; a distinct PHNX Hotels unit is zeroing in on smaller-scale IRL happenings, the appropriate sites and social profiles show.</p>\n    <p>“We’re excited for Limewire’s plans for FYRE,” McFarland said to Digital Music News. “With Limewire at the helm of FYRE Festival, and the pre-existing FYRE Musical and FYRE Music partnerships, there’s an incredible future for the brand. I look forward to continuing to make cultural moments, paying restitution, and shocking the world <a href=\"https://x.com/pyrtbilly/status/1962889851792941103\">with PHNX</a>.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/limewire-fyre-festival-acquisition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Photo Credit: Algemeen Nederlandsch Fotobureau</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>Over two years later, Universal Music, Sony Music, and the Internet Archive have officially settled their copyright infringement battle over the latter’s Great 78 Project. </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>Both sides informed the court that they’d reached an agreement (pending “final approval and signatures”) late last week, and the presiding judge signed off on a dismissal order yesterday.</p>\n    <p>According to the order, the case has been tossed without prejudice. But should any of the involved parties indicate during the next 90 days “that the agreed-upon consideration for said settlement has not been delivered,” the litigation would resume, Judge Maxine Chesney noted.</p>\n    <p>Absent from the settlement confirmation and the dismissal order is any mention of the resolution’s terms. And as things stand, it appears unlikely that the majors or the Internet Archive defendants will publicly disclose pertinent information here.</p>\n    <p>(As highlighted, Universal Music and Sony Music signed onto the action, but Warner Music didn’t do so. Furthermore, Warner/Atlantic exec Craig Kallman sits on the board of the ARChive of Contemporary Music, itself “a not-for-profit archive, music library and research center” that says it’s “donated to and digitized” some 371,000 “audio 78rpm sides…with The Internet Archive.”)</p>\n    <p>“As noted in the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68101636/180/umg-recordings-inc-v-internet-archive/\">recent court filings</a> in <i>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Internet Archive</i>,” Internet Archive director of library services Chris Freeland <a href=\"https://blog.archive.org/2025/09/15/an-update-on-the-great-78s-lawsuit/\">spelled out</a>, “both parties have advised the Court that the matter has been settled. The parties have reached a confidential resolution of all claims and will have no further public comment on this matter.”</p>\n    <h4>\n      <strong>Nevertheless, we aren’t without worthwhile details concerning the circumstances surrounding the settlement. </strong>\n    </h4>\n    <p>First, the Great 78 Project – which, as its name suggests, “is a community project for the preservation, research and discovery of 78rpm records” – remains live. However, the resource, presumably still encompassing north of 400,000 recordings, looks to have parted with the works at issue in the suit.</p>\n    <p>Among those works are songs from Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald, to name just a few. And per its archive-updates page, the Great 78 Project last added new recordings in September 2024.</p>\n    <p>Another consideration: the case’s optics weren’t exactly great. This became especially apparent late last year, when approximately 850 musicians <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/04/10/internet-archive-lawsuit-settlement-talks/\">signed a letter</a> opposing the “major record labels’ unjust lawsuit targeting the Internet Archive.”</p>\n    <p>One component of a campaign organized by Fight for the Future, the same letter also described a variety of compensation-related qualms about streaming, concerts, and more. When reached for comment, Fight for the Future campaigns and communications director Lia Holland told DMN that “it’s good to at least see that the Internet Archive won’t be destroyed.”</p>\n    <p>“The Great 78s Project wasn’t hurting anyone—and at a time of record music industry profits despite falling and failing incomes for most working artists,” Holland proceeded in part, “the Internet Archive certainly wasn’t the cause of even successful musicians being unable to tour or make rent. Simply put, music industry shareholders are looking for scapegoats wherever they can find them, and they thought attacking the Internet Archive would be an easy way to hide their unfair and extractive practices from working musicians.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/great-78-project-lawsuit-settlement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For the <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/11/bad-bunny-says-he-didnt-tour-mainland-us-because-of-possible-ice-raids/\">final show on his 30-night residency</a>, Benito is adding one more night: “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más.” Teaming up with Amazon, the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-amazon-music-prime-video\">final performance will be livestreamed</a> exclusively on Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Twitch on Saturday, September 20, at 8:30 PM ET.</p>\n    <p>The performance marks the final show of his Puerto Rico residency, which began on July 11 and featured nine shows exclusively for island residents. Further, it represents the first global broadcast from the residency, and commemorates the eighth anniversary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria\">Hurricane Maria</a>.</p>\n    <h4>The collaboration will not only make the Latin heartthrob’s mega-popular residency accessible to fans, but serve to launch initiatives <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/10/bad-bunny-puerto-rico-tour/\">supporting Puerto Rico’s economic growth</a>.

We are incredibly proud of this multi-year collaboration, which turns the power of music into meaningful and lasting progress for the island.”</p>\n    <p>Fans will also get even more access to Bad Bunny through exclusive content and merch. Bad Bunny will host a takeover of Platino, Amazon Music’s flagship Latin playlist, curating a comprehensive tribute to Puerto Rico’s vibrant musical legacy.

National security concerns have been expressed by both U.S. parties over TikTok’s Chinese ownership for years, but the Trump administration says a deal is finally on the horizon.</p>\n    <p>People familiar with the matter say existing users in the U.S. would be moved to a new, U.S.-based version of TikTok—which the existing TikTok has built and is testing. TikTok engineers will recreate a set of content recommendation algorithms for the app, using technology licensed from ByteDance, sources <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/details-emerge-on-u-s-china-tiktok-deal-594e009f\">told</a> <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.</p>\n    <p>U.S.-based software giant <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/03/14/is-oracle-the-frontrunner-to-run-tiktok/\">Oracle</a>, which has long been a TikTok partner, would continue to handle user data at its Texas facilities. Longtime tech investors like VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and private equity firm Silver Lake, are part of the consortium that would control an 80% stake in the new company.</p>\n    <p>Existing ByteDance investors, including Susquehanna International, General Atlantic, and KKR, would also be part of the group that would own around 80% of the U.S.-based TikTok. This would leave ByteDance and its Chinese shareholders with around a 20% stake, which is low enough to comply with the U.S. law passed in 2024. The <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-law-upheld/\">law</a> stipulates that TikTok must be sold to a U.S. entity or face a federal ban in America.</p>\n    <h4>The finer details of the proposed deal and its terms could still change, as both sides are still at the negotiating table. As anticipated, Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/trump-extends-tiktok-deadline-again-00567058\">signed his fourth executive order</a> to push back the deadline for a deal to be reached; the new deadline is December 16.</h4>\n    <p>In order for the TikTok deal to comply with U.S. law, which was passed last year and upheld in January by the Supreme Court, the platform’s algorithms must be created and maintained by an American engineering team insulated from Chinese influence. This, according to tech experts and those close to the matter, is the trickiest part of arranging a deal—<a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/05/31/tiktok-separate-us-app-cloned-algorithm/\">TikTok’s algorithm is considered the most lucrative aspect</a> of the company and its platform.</p>\n    <p>Negotiations surrounding TikTok are key in establishing the grounds for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, which is to take place later this year. Beijing has been pushing for the U.S. president to visit China.</p>\n    <p>“We’ve got a deal on TikTok. I’ve reached a deal with China,” Trump said on Tuesday morning. “I’m going to speak to President Xi on Friday to confirm everything. […] These are very big companies that want to buy it.”</p>\n    <p>With a proposed deal with the U.S. government on the horizon, the internal valuation of ByteDance hit a record high of $330 billion in August. Its revenue rose by around 25% in the first half of the year to $91 billion. Approximately a quarter of that revenue comes from business outside China, according to company investors.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/tiktok-deal-terms-leak-stake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

CEO Micha Kaufman took to LinkedIn to reveal 30% of staff will be laid off—around 250 positions—as the company pivots to being ‘AI first.’</h2>\n    <p>This marks a sharp contraction for the freelance sector, of which Fiverr has grown steadily since its NYSE listing in 2019. Musicians and voice actors often posted on the site to garner freelance income between big jobs. Podcast intros/outros, indie game music, commercial jingles, local radio voice talent, and more are just some services offered by artists on the platform.</p>\n    <h4>”For months, I’ve been sharing my thoughts on how AI is reshaping not only work but also the increasingly immersive ways humans and machines interact,” Kaufman <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fiverr-going-back-startup-mode-micha-kaufman-jfe6f/?trackingId=69ugUf5ESHGvEf8hGJd0Eg%3D%3D\">said</a> in his letter on LinkedIn. “This will lead to fundamental changes in how societal activities are organized and how businesses operate. The speed at which technology is changing, and the possibilities it brings, are incredible and they demand new thinking and higher velocity to stay at the top of our game.”</h4>\n    <p>“This transformation requires a painful reset, and as we make it, we will be parting ways with approximately 250 team members across the different departments, resulting in a smaller and flatter organization. This is possibly one of the toughest decisions that I have had to make, especially as Fiverr is such a magical place with a strong sense of belonging and mission-driven culture.”</p>\n    <p>While Fiverr is downsizing, major competitor Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK) has performed better in 2025, posting <a href=\"https://investors.upwork.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upwork-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-0\">record Q2 revenue</a> as it pivots to AI-backed enterprise services. Upwork’s strategy has helped it retain both enterprise and creative clients, while Fiverr’s core ‘gig’ model—previously ideal for small creative jobs—has not matched Upwork’s results in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/15/its-happening-fast-creative-workers-and-professionals-share-their-fears-and-hopes-about-the-rise-of-ai\">landscape shifted by AI</a>.</p>\n    <p>Fiverr says it will pivot to being AI first and accelerate its development of high-margin, AI-driven offerings. Freelancers in the creative community who provide services on Fiverr have been told their day-to-day business won’t be impacted by the layoffs.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/fiverr-is-struggling-layoffs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, Spirit chief creative officer and Spirit Nashville CEO Frank Rogers in a statement touted the Philadelphia, Mississippi-born artist’s accomplishments.</p>\n    <p>“HARDY is a multi-genre force of nature as an artist, a world-class songwriter and a great human being,” added Rogers. “Spirit could not be more excited to welcome HARDY to the family and we are excited about helping him build on his already legendary career.”</p>\n    <h4>To reiterate the obvious, the company and Hardy (who’s set to release his fourth studio album on the 26th) will have plenty of time to build on that career.</h4>\n    <p>By now, most are well aware of legacy talent’s blockbuster catalog sales – with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/10/04/sorry-sony-pink-floyd-says-zero-chance-of-a-reunion-tour/\">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/04/17/primary-wave-neil-sedaka-deal/\">Neil Sedaka</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/02/15/rod-stewart-iconic-artists-group-deal/\">Rod Stewart</a> among the veteran acts who have sold their song rights.</p>\n    <p>But to this point in 2025 alone, the <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/07/21/jonas-brothers-catalog-sale/\">Jonas Brothers</a> (the oldest of whom is 37), <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/05/29/harbourview-rodney-jerkins-catalog-deal/\">Rodney Jerkins</a> (48), <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/05/01/influence-media-dj-khaled-deal/\">DJ Khaled</a> (49), <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/03/05/deadmau5-create-music-group-catalog-deal/\">Deadmau5</a> (44), and <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/02/20/t-pain-sells-publishing-catalog-harbourview/\">T-Pain</a> (40) have turned their bodies of work into once-off paydays.

Already, DMN has picked up on rumblings of post-sale regrets on the part of relatively young professionals.</p>\n    <p>(There’s room for a parenthetical here about the potential pitfalls associated with securing huge checks.

These new features are designed to further <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/27/youtube-expands-hype-feature-globally/\">engage superfans</a> and connect them with the artists they love.</p>\n    <p>“Twenty years ago, YouTube launched with the idea that everyone should have the opportunity to create and find a global stage,” the company said. “Since then, we’ve seen creators shape culture and entertainment in ways we never thought possible. Anyone with an idea—whether an individual artist, studio, or brand—can become a creator here.”</p>\n    <p>YouTube says it has paid out over $100 billion to creators, artists, and media companies worldwide just in the last four years. “We didn’t just create a platform,” says Neal Mohan, YouTube CEO. “We built an economy.”</p>\n    <p>A new countdown for upcoming releases and the ability to pre-save tracks or albums in advance are coming later this year. The timer will be displayed on the album detail page, artist profile, and album shelf. Notably, this functionality is a clear effort to compete with YouTube Music rival Spotify. The Stockholm streamer’s <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2024/07/25/spotify-countdown-for-artists/\">Countdown Pages</a> have been a big hit for the most dedicated fans, who eagerly await new content from their idols.</p>\n    <h4>Artists on YouTube Music will also be able to engage with their most loyal fans starting next year by offering exclusive “thank you” videos, behind-the-scenes clips, and other exclusive content. This feature, again, is similar to one Spotify rolls out each year in the form of Wrapped. But YouTube’s version is focused more on rewarding top supporters and building a more personal connection between fans and artists, rather than a recap of a user’s yearly listening habits.</h4>\n    <p>Further, YouTube Music is rolling out a pilot program for users in the U.S., allowing them to access exclusive merch drops from artists. Unsurprisingly, Spotify has also been testing a <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/08/25/spotify-price-increases-new-features/\">superfan-oriented program</a> or subscription tier that it says would offer similar features.</p>\n    <p>YouTube’s latest announcement follows its music platform’s recent rollout of new features last month in honor of YouTube Music’s 10th anniversary. These include collaborative playlists, achievement badges, and the ability to comment on albums and playlists.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/09/16/youtube-music-new-fan-engagement-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Between the chatbots that answer our questions and the recommendation systems that shape our choices, AI-driven tools are now embedded in nearly every interaction. But the latest wave of so-called “agentic AI”—systems that can plan, act, and adapt toward a defined goal—promises to push automation even further.</p>\n    <p>\"Every single person that I've spoken to has at least spoken to some sort of GenAI bot on their phones. They expect experiences to be not scripted. It's almost like we're not improving customer experience, we're getting to the point of what customers expect customer experience to be,\" says vice president of product management at NICE, Neeraj Verma.</p>\n    <p>For businesses, the potential is transformative: AI agents that can handle complex service interactions, support employees in real time, and scale seamlessly as customer demands shift. But the move from scripted, deterministic flows to non-deterministic, generative systems brings new challenges. How can you test something that doesn’t always respond the same way twice? How can you balance safety and flexibility when giving an AI system access to core infrastructure? And how can you manage cost, transparency, and ethical risk while still pursuing meaningful returns?</p>\n    <p>These solutions will determine how, and how quickly, companies embrace the next era of customer experience technology.</p>\n    <p>Verma argues that the story of customer experience automation over the past decade has been one of shifting expectations—from rigid, deterministic flows to flexible, generative systems. Along the way, businesses have had to rethink how they mitigate risk, implement guardrails, and measure success. The future, Verma suggests, belongs to organizations that focus on outcome-oriented design: tools that work transparently, safely, and at scale.</p>\n    <p>“I believe that the big winners are going to be the use case companies, the applied AI companies,” says Verma.</p>\n    <p>This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

But this week showed that another threat entirely—that of kids forming unhealthy bonds with AI—is the one pulling AI safety out of the academic fringe and into regulators’ crosshairs.</p>\n<p>This has been bubbling for a while. Two high-profile lawsuits filed in the last year, against Character.AI and OpenAI, allege that companion-like behavior in their models contributed to the suicides of two teenagers. A study by US nonprofit Common Sense Media, published in July, found that 72% of teenagers have used AI for companionship. Stories in reputable outlets about “AI psychosis” have highlighted how endless conversations with chatbots can lead people down delusional spirals.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to overstate the impact of these stories. To the public, they are proof that AI is not merely imperfect, but a technology that’s more harmful than helpful. If you doubted that this outrage would be taken seriously by regulators and companies, three things happened this week that might change your mind.</p>\n<p>A California law passes the legislature</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the California state legislature passed a first-of-its-kind bill. It would require AI companies to include reminders for users they know to be minors that responses are AI generated. Companies would also need to have a protocol for addressing suicide and self-harm and provide annual reports on instances of suicidal ideation in users’ conversations with their chatbots. It was led by Democratic state senator Steve Padilla, passed with heavy bipartisan support, and now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature.</p>\n<p>There are reasons to be skeptical of the bill’s impact. It doesn’t specify efforts companies should take to identify which users are minors, and lots of AI companies already include referrals to crisis providers when someone is talking about suicide. (In the case of Adam Raine, one of the teenagers whose survivors are suing, his conversations with ChatGPT before his death included this type of information, but the chatbot allegedly went on to give advice related to suicide anyway.)</p>\n<p>Still, it is undoubtedly the most significant of the efforts to rein in companion-like behaviors in AI models, which are in the works in other states too. If the bill becomes law, it would strike a blow to the position OpenAI has taken, which is that “America leads best with clear, nationwide rules, not a patchwork of state or local regulations,” as the company’s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, wrote on LinkedIn last week.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission takes aim</p>\n<p>The very same day, the Federal Trade Commission announced an inquiry into seven companies, seeking information about how they develop companion-like characters, monetize engagement, measure and test the impact of their chatbots, and more. The companies are Google, Instagram, Meta, OpenAI, Snap, X, and Character Technologies, the maker of Character.AI.</p>\n<p>The White House now wields immense, and potentially illegal, political influence over the agency. In March, President Trump fired its lone Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter. In July, a federal judge ruled that firing illegal, but last week the US Supreme Court temporarily permitted the firing.</p>\n<p>“Protecting kids online is a top priority for the Trump-Vance FTC, and so is fostering innovation in critical sectors of our economy,” said FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson in a press release about the inquiry.</p>\n<p>Right now, it’s just that—an inquiry—but the process might (depending on how public the FTC makes its findings) reveal the inner workings of how the companies build their AI companions to keep users coming back again and again.</p>\n<p>Sam Altman on suicide cases</p>\n<p>Also on the same day (a busy day for AI news), Tucker Carlson published an hour-long interview with OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman. It covers a lot of ground—Altman’s battle with Elon Musk, OpenAI’s military customers, conspiracy theories about the death of a former employee—but it also includes the most candid comments Altman’s made so far about the cases of suicide following conversations with AI.</p>\n<p>Altman talked about “the tension between user freedom and privacy and protecting vulnerable users” in cases like these. But then he offered up something I hadn’t heard before.</p>\n<p>“I think it’d be very reasonable for us to say that in cases of young people talking about suicide seriously, where we cannot get in touch with parents, we do call the authorities,” he said. “That would be a change.”</p>\n<p>So where does all this go next? For now, it’s clear that—at least in the case of children harmed by AI companionship—companies’ familiar playbook won’t hold. They can no longer deflect responsibility by leaning on privacy, personalization, or “user choice.” Pressure to take a harder line is mounting from state laws, regulators, and an outraged public.</p>\n<p>But what will that look like? Politically, the left and right are now paying attention to AI’s harm to children, but their solutions differ. On the right, the proposed solution aligns with the wave of internet age-verification laws that have now been passed in over 20 states. These are meant to shield kids from adult content while defending “family values.” On the left, it’s the revival of stalled ambitions to hold Big Tech accountable through antitrust and consumer-protection powers.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/16/1123614/the-looming-crackdown-on-ai-companionship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now a data leak affecting the DHS's intelligence arm has shed light not just on how the department gathers and stores that sensitive information—including about its surveillance of Americans—but on how it once left that data exposed to thousands of government and private sector workers and even foreign nationals who were never authorized to see it.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/foia-document-breach-sensitive-dhs-domestic-intelligence-sharing-portal\">internal DHS memo</a> obtained by a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/freedom-of-information-act/\">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) request and shared with WIRED reveals that from March to May of 2023, a DHS online platform used by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&amp;A) to share sensitive but unclassified intelligence information and investigative leads among the DHS, the FBI, the National Counterterrorism Center, local law enforcement, and intelligence fusion centers across the US was misconfigured, accidentally exposing restricted intelligence information to all users of the platform.</p>\n<p>Access to the data, according to a DHS inquiry described in the memo, was meant to be limited to users of the Homeland Security Information Network's intelligence section, known as HSIN-Intel. Instead it was set to grant access to “everyone,” exposing the information to HSIN's tens of thousands of users. The unauthorized users who had access included US government workers focused on fields unrelated to intelligence or law enforcement such as disaster response, as well as private sector contractors and foreign government staff with access to HSIN.</p>\n<p>“DHS advertises HSIN as secure and says the information it holds is sensitive, critical national security information,” says Spencer Reynolds, an attorney for the Brennan Center for Justice who obtained the memo via FOIA and shared it with WIRED. “But this incident raises questions about how seriously they take information security. Thousands and thousands of users gained access to information they were never supposed to have.”</p>\n<p>HSIN-Intel's data includes everything from law enforcement leads and tips to reports on foreign hacking and disinformation campaigns, to analysis of domestic protest movements. The memo about the HSIN-Intel breach specifically mentions, for instance, a report discussing “protests relating to a police training facility in Atlanta”—likely the Stop Cop City protests opposing the creation of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center—noting that it focused on “media praising actions like throwing stones, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at police.”</p>\n<p>In total, according to the memo about the DHS internal inquiry, 439 I&amp;A “products” on the HSIN-Intel portion of the platform were improperly accessed 1,525 times. Of those unauthorized access instances, the report found that 518 were private sector users and another 46 were non-US citizens. The instances of foreign user accesses were “almost entirely” focused on cybersecurity information, the report notes, and 39 percent of all the improperly accessed intelligence products involved cybersecurity, such as foreign state-sponsored hacker groups and foreign targeting of government IT systems. The memo also noted that some of the unauthorized US users who viewed the information would have been eligible to have accessed the restricted information if they’d asked to be considered for authorization.</p>\n<p>“When this coding error was discovered, I&amp;A immediately fixed the problem and investigated any potential harm,” a DHS spokesperson told WIRED in a statement. “Following an extensive review, multiple oversight bodies determined there was no impactful or serious security breach. DHS takes all security and privacy measures seriously and is committed to ensuring its intelligence is shared with federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners to protect our homeland from the numerous adversarial threats we face.\"</p>\n<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US intelligence agencies, didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Although the exposure occurred under the Biden administration, the memo highlights the risks of surveillance data collected on Americans that persists under the current administration, argues Jeramie Scott, the director of the Surveillance Oversight Program at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a digital rights nonprofit. In fact, he argues, the relative lack of transparency of the Trump administration and DHS's hostility to oversight measures suggests that if a similar data breach occurred now, the public might never know. As an example, he points to the effective <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/homeland-security-crcl-civil-rights-immigration-border-patrol-trump-kristi-noem\">shuttering of the 150-person DHS oversight arm</a> known as the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. “If this was occurring then, is this type of thing going to be captured now?” Scott asks. \"Everyone should be concerned about the fact that things like this happen, and oversight has only deteriorated since this incident occurred.\"</p>\n<p>According to the memo about the DHS's inquiry into its intelligence exposure, the DHS Office of Privacy initially considered the breach to have had “minimal to low impact.\" But the author of the memo, whose name has been redacted in the form released under FOIA, determined that the Office of Privacy hadn't fully considered the personally identifiable information (PII) exposed in the breach, particularly that of Americans, contradicting that “low impact” assessment. The memo recommended as one finding of the inquiry that I&amp;A retrain staff on the definitions of PII.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-dhs-data-hub-exposed-sensitive-intel-to-thousands-of-unauthorized-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One possible protection from this data collection is a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-burner-phone/\">burner phone</a>. As invasive state surveillance ramps up globally—including new initiatives in the United States to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-from-phone-searches-at-the-us-border/\">monitor travelers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/\">protesters</a>, and <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/trumps-immigration-crackdown-built-ai-surveillance-and-disregard-due-process\">vulnerable populations</a>—privacy tools that were formerly the domain of digital hermits and people involved in organized crime are now more and more appealing to everyone.</p>\n<p>Burner phones, which are often “dumb” flip phones, can be loaded with prepaid minutes and offer anonymity when rotated frequently, purchased with cash, and siloed from any connections to you or your digital life. The idea is that cops, or other actors, are unlikely to be tracking a fresh burner phone in real time. But the crucial additional layer of protection that properly used burner phones offer is that even if they are—or they later tie communications from a burner phone to activity they are investigating—they can’t use digital ties to establish who was using it.</p>\n<p>“Burner phones are used for a very specific, time-limited purpose and then discarded,” says Danacea Vo, founder of Cyberlixir, a cybersecurity <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DHuJM3sMxxY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">provider</a> for nonprofits and vulnerable communities. “They’re mostly used to separate your identity from the identity of the device. Anonymity is the goal.”</p>\n<p>Using a burner phone may seem like overkill, and it takes money, time, and some know-how to actually use them effectively. But once you understand the concepts, you can apply them to your specific situation to make more informed choices about how to best protect yourself and your privacy. This guide talks about burner phones that meet the strict definition, as well as “alternative” phones, or altphones, that apply many of the same concepts of burner phones but don’t offer the same degree of anonymity.</p>\n<h2>Assessing Your Risks</h2>\n<p>Whether you should be using a burner phone depends on your risk model—the factors and concerns that are specific to you. Every one of us is exposed to a different set of risks that can vary depending on your nationality, citizenship, political views, profession, and much more. For example, lawyers, activists, and journalists may be at higher risk of being targeted by authoritarian governments than, say, an electrician or a stay-at-home mom.</p>\n<p>Your risk level and tolerance changes over time—possibly even from one day to the next—and this influences how you communicate with people and the devices you use to do so. When considering using a burner device, think about who you are trying to keep from getting your data or communications.</p>\n<p>“Use cases for burners may include: crossing borders, traveling to a risky environment, or participating in or documenting a protest,” says Mohammed Al-Maskati, digital security helpline director at the rights group Access Now. “People should make these decisions based on their risk profile and the threats they feasibly face.”</p>\n<p>Even if you conclude that using a true burner phone is right for you in certain situations, keep in mind that you can, and should, still use your regular devices for the vast majority of your digital activity. Unless you are actively hiding your existence or residence, you likely do not need to regularly use burner phones. And that’s a good thing, because taking the precautions required to establish the anonymity needed to maintain a device as a true burner phone—even for just one day—is challenging.</p>\n<p>“Burner phones are almost impossible to keep anonymous,” says Rebecca Williams, a senior strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union’s privacy and data governance unit, who recently organized a <a href=\"https://rebeccawilliams.info/burner-phone-101/\">community burner phone workshop in Brooklyn, New York</a>. “No burner phone is perfect.”</p>\n<h2>Setting Up a Burner Phone</h2>\n<p>The hardest—and arguably the most critical—aspect of setting up a burner phone is purchasing the device and corresponding prepaid service in a way that preserves your anonymity. It’s not a burner phone, for example, if you purchased it with your credit card, your best friend’s credit card, or your neighbor’s credit card.</p>\n<p>So purchase your burner with cash or consider using a prepaid debit card that you previously purchased with cash. Depending on where you’re shopping for your burner phone, these transactions may blend in a bit more than a cash purchase. Keep in mind, though, that for the latter to work you also have to take steps to shield your identity when purchasing the debit card.</p>\n<p>Ideally, authorities or other actors will never discover the activity of your burner phone; but realistically, you need to be operating under the assumption that they eventually will. That is the point at which the separation between your identity and the burner phone is tested. But even if you can’t perfectly shield yourself, you can make it more difficult to establish a connection.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-set-up-use-burner-phone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n<h2>Featured in this article</h2>\n<p>There are literally hundreds of VPNs floating around. They all want you to believe they're the best VPN you can buy. All of them say they have the biggest network, or claim they have a no-logging policy. And they all promise your internet traffic is safe on the network of servers they've rented. Only some of them are telling the truth.</p>\n<p>VPNs are only growing in popularity due to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-checked-internet-has-arrived/\">age-verification laws in the UK</a> and in several <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-supreme-court-porn-age-verification-decision-2025/\">states in the US</a>. Even if you don't <i>want</i> a VPN, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/vpns-and-age-verification-laws/\">you might need one</a>. If you're hesitant, I get it. VPN providers have been deep in murky waters for years, constantly caught lying about their practices, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2017/10/08/vpn_logs_helped_unmask_alleged_net_stalker_say_feds\">handing over user data</a> that was never supposed to be logged, and serving as safe <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/01/cybercriminals-friend-vpnlab-net-shut-down-by-law-enforcement\">havens for large cybercriminal organizations</a>.</p>\n<p>I wanted to find the VPN services that actually work; the ones that keep their promises even in the face of potential prosecution, and the ones that have a proven track record of reliable performance. Some of the picks in this guide aren't conventional, and some of the services I suggest you avoid might be controversial. But these are the top VPNs I'd use day-to-day.</p>\n<p>Read our other VPN guides, including <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-on-your-router/\">how to set up a VPN on your router</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-a-vpn-to-watch-to-netflix-when-you-travel/\">how to use a VPN to watch Netflix when you travel abroad</a>.</p>\n<p>How Much Do VPNs Cost?</p>\n<p>There's a broad range of prices for VPN services, but most providers sit somewhere around $10 per month for a monthly plan. That number changes if you purchase several months at once, and it's even more obfuscated with full security suites, such as those offered by Nord Security and Proton.</p>\n<p>Most of the prominent VPN services you'll come across offer multi-month, or even multi-year, discounts. These plans are often the best way to get your foot in the door, but recently, some <a href=\"https://wittelslaw.com/cases/wmp-files-100-million-class-action-lawsuit-against-nordvpn\">VPNs have faced class-action lawsuits</a> in regards to their auto-renewal practices. Although a handful of lawsuits have been filed, that doesn't mean these services necessarily engaged in illegal practices.</p>\n<p>Free VPNs exist, as well, but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/free-vpn-android-ios-privacy/\">you should avoid most of them</a>. Some restrictive free plans from Proton and Windscribe are useful, but you should handle most free VPNs with skepticism.</p>\n<p>What Does a VPN Do? And How Does It Work?</p>\n<p>VPN stands for virtual private network. A VPN provides a tunnel that all of your internet traffic passes through. Instead of connecting to the servers of your internet service provider, you connect to a server in the VPN's network before connecting to the broader internet. Due to how most VPNs services operate, your browsing data isn't stored, essentially making you anonymous online.</p>\n<p>The linchpin in this system is a VPN protocol. Today, nearly all internet traffic is encrypted, but that encryption only happens once you've established a connection with a website. A VPN protocol encrypts traffic before it heads off to the VPN server, which adds some extra security on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport. It doesn't help much on your personal network unless someone is intruding on it.</p>\n<p>Although VPNs are often marketed as security tools, they serve a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/vpns-and-age-verification-laws/\">better purpose for privacy</a> and bypassing geo-restrictions. By anonymizing your traffic through a VPN server, your browsing can't be traced back to you. And, by routing your traffic through a server in another location, you can bypass geo-restrictions online, such as the content libraries available in different countries on Netflix.</p>\n<p>VPN Terms and Features, Explained</p>\n<p>You'll come across a few of these terms in this guide and as you generally shop for a VPN. Here's what they mean.</p>\n<p><strong>Double-hop:</strong> Connecting to two (or more) VPN servers in succession. This provides an extra layer of privacy if someone traces your network path, but it will vastly reduce speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Split tunneling:</strong> Allows you to choose which apps use the VPN tunnel. Useful if you want some apps (like your browser) to use the VPN tunnel but not others.</p>\n<p><strong>Kill switch:</strong> A security feature in VPNs that will disable your internet connection if the VPN connection drops. A kill switch can avoid leaking internet traffic in the event of a VPN failure.</p>\n<p><strong>IP and domain block list:</strong> A list of IP addresses or domain names that are blocked inside the VPN tunnel. Some VPNs offer Domain Name System (DNS) blocking, too, which can block ads served from particular DNS servers.</p>\n<p><strong>Static IP:</strong> Most VPNs assign you a random IP address, or even rotate the IP address while you’re connected. If you need external access to your network with a network-wide VPN, you'll need a static IP address.</p>\n<p><strong>Port forwarding:</strong> Allows you to forward a port on your private network, bypassing the VPN tunnel. Useful for instances where you need external network access with a network-wide VPN, such as running a media server.</p>\n<p><strong>NetShield:</strong> A feature specific to Proton VPN that blocks ads and trackers while connected to the VPN. Other services, such as Windscribe and NordVPN, offer similar features.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-vpn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

What happened in the '40s, '50s, '60s, there was a project, it was a collaboration between the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Foundation, which was the research arm of the Mayo clinic, and the Hormel Institute, which was the research arm of pork. The goal here was to create a smaller pig, a pig that would be a good match in terms of not just the size of human organs, but the functions. There were all these studies were done looking at do pigs get coronary artery disease? And it turns out they do. In fact, the pig was described in one of their papers as a caricature of an obese human. In other words, gets heart disease, has heart issues, doesn't get enough exercise. …</p>\n    <p>If you are going to use the pig as your model, as your stand-in for a human, then you want to be sure that these organs ... behave similarly, that they have a similar size. So this research, once it got rolling, and there were dozens and dozens of papers, three volumes of papers looking at kidney function, liver function. There was one on orthodontia where they had put braces onto pigs. So it was all toward the goal of creating an analog, a stand-in for a human being for trying out surgical techniques or not so much pharmaceuticals, but techniques and replacements. So the pig became the go-to creature. … I mean who knows, a goat might've been equally useful, but nobody started using goats.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On preventing the body from rejecting a pig organ </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>With an organ that's coming from another species, the reaction is quite severe. It's called a hyperacute rejection, where, within minutes, the body starts to attack, the organ starts to turn black. You don't want to put a pig organ into somebody without it having been genetically edited. So one of the things that's edited is something called the alpha-gal protein. And this is a surface protein that the body, if you can knock that out, you're basically just making the pig organ seem a little less pig-like and a little more human-like. So now you're dealing with a level of rejection that you would get with a human transplant. In other words, taking some other human's organ and transplanting it. So the person is still on an immunosuppressive regimen, taking drugs to suppress the immune system. But on about the same level as they would with a human.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On if a pig transplant is kosher </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I asked the surgeon who was involved in the first pig transplant … and he said, yeah, there are a lot of folks both in the Jewish religion and the Muslim religion who really wish we'd chosen a different species, because I had been asking him, why pigs? And he says, I get that question all the time. The thing is, he said, we're not eating them, we are saving lives. So it's OK to get a pig organ if you're keeping kosher. ... There were interviews with various religious thought leaders and there was consensus that it is indeed OK to have a pig organ implanted. Just don't eat it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiments 3D printing muscle and tissue </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I spent a day at the Feinberg lab at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, and what people were working on there was trying to print muscle in a way that the alignment of the cells would create muscle that had the specific function that muscle needed. In other words, a heart, the heart needs to move in a kind of a twisting motion. It twists as it pumps, so you've got to print the cells. They have to be in a helix shape, which is different from, say, the hamstring, where it'd be kind of parallel. Or the shoulder muscle, they're in a fan-like shape, which gives you a lot of the versatility of the movement of the shoulder. So you're not just printing generic muscle. You have to print it in a very specific way to achieve the function that you want it to be doing, which I found kind of amazing. No one is printing whole organs. That's way off in the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the tediousness of tissue recovery for organ donations </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I arrived in the room where they were doing the tissue recovery, where they would be extracting the bone and the tendon and the skin, etc., one of the people doing it said to me, this is the worst part of the job. And I kind of assumed I had preconceived notions of what the worst of that job might be, but she was talking about handwriting on labels the same ID number over and over, double checking, cross checking, the amount of paperwork and labeling, and then at the end, packing and shipping was the tedious and unpleasant part of her job, not the opening up of a leg and the extracting of bone or ligament. I guess I just wasn't expecting that.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On how knowing too much about how our bodies work can get in your head</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I wrote <i>Gulp ...</i> I became really aware of what's going on in your mouth when you chew, the process of bolus formation, where you're taking a piece of meat, say, and you're breaking it down and then you're putting it back together in a bolus that's a shape that can slide down the throat. And I visited somebody who studies chewing and this process and what the jaws do, and I remember for a while after that going to restaurants and thinking, looking around at people chewing and swallowing and thinking this is disgusting. People should have sex in public and eat in private! It's absolutely disgusting.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Here, though, Chidgey imagines an outcome in which a treaty leaves no clear victor, and in which the U.K. carries on with the caveat that Nazi crimes have become useful scientific precedent.

She is smiling wearing a black t-shirt with the polished wooden floor and a large mirror of the studio in soft focus in the background.\"/>\n    <p>At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.</p>\n    <p>Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo\">a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April</a>, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.</p>\n    <p>Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home.</p>\n    <p>\"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"</p>\n    <p>Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.</p>\n    <p>The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.</p>\n    <p>Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.</p>\n    <p>The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet.</p>\n    <p>The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.</p>\n    <p>It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.</p>\n    <p>That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.</p>\n    <p>\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.</p>\n    <p>Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending.</p>\n    <p>And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head. She is wearing a black t-shirt and is standng in a dance studio. In the background there is a window with curtains on the left and a white door at the back.\"/>\n    <p>Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now.</p>\n    <p>That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.</p>\n    <p>As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.</p>\n    <p>The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".</p>\n    <p>So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation.</p>\n    <p>Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that.</p>\n    <p>Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.</p>\n    <p>The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4gnk7g228o\">the row over the winter fuel payment</a>, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.</p>\n    <p>That is not just the case with current retirees.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.</p>\n    <p>Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.</p>\n    <p>There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.</p>\n    <p>No-one said getting older was easy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In the Tower Hamlets area of London, some 49% of pensioners still received the payment.</p>\n    <p>Whereas in Hart, in Hampshire, and Wokingham, in Berkshire, only 5% received it, compared with an England and Wales average of 13%.</p>\n    <h2>U-turn pressure</h2>\n    <p>Following widespread anger and a backlash from some Labour MPs who blamed the policy for their party's poor showing in local elections in May, Reeves announced a partial reversal.</p>\n    <p>Pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will now be eligible for the payment, and will receive a letter about it in October or November.</p>\n    <p>It means more than three-quarters of pensioners will receive the help this winter. This policy will be matched by the Scottish government.</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment\">winter fuel payment</a> in England and Wales is worth £200 for people of state pension age up to 79-years-old. People aged 80 or older receive £300.</p>\n    <p>In Scotland this coming winter, the payment will be increased in line with inflation, which charts rising prices, so will be worth either £203.40 or £305.10 per household.</p>\n    <p>Energy bills will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78zgz7j576o\">rise by 2% in October</a>, under energy regulator Ofgem's price cap, unless a household is on a fixed deal.</p>\n    <p>The latest data comes as pensioners were also given a strong hint about the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo\">likely rise in the state pension next April. </a></p>\n    <p>A government spokesman said nine million pensioners would receive the payment this winter, and ministers had also reaffirmed their commitment to the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>\"And thanks to our efforts to boost pension credit take up, over 57,000 extra pensioner households were awarded the benefit, worth on average £4,300 a year,\" he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrq5049j0yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We were aware of it before the summer, but the last two weeks have made it more difficult,\" is how one senior figure put it.</p>\n    <p>Another senior figure tells me Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party Conference in a fortnight's time \"will leave people in absolutely no doubt at all what he stands for and what the government stands for\".</p>\n    <p>That, in itself, is a tacit acknowledgement that from No10's point of view nowhere near enough people could say what he stands for now.</p>\n    <p>The argument we are likely to hear is being rehearsed already: the prime minister told Channel 4 News that he has every intention of sticking around as Labour's leader, and made the case for why:</p>\n    <p>\"I am absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour Party and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.\"</p>\n    <p>What, then, of Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party?</p>\n    <p>My phone rings and it is a former Conservative cabinet minister on the other end.</p>\n    <p>They say it is \"another unsurprising exit\" and describe Kruger as \"impossible\" and an \"ideologue\".</p>\n    <p>But when I bump into another former Conservative cabinet minister they are more pensive at what they fear the defection says about the Tories.</p>\n    <p>As the Conservatives also approach their annual conference, they confront a moment of peril greater than any in their modern history.</p>\n    <p>And then there is Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>Make no mistake, they face colossal questions:</p>\n    <p>Just for a start, can they build the campaigning infrastructure, the local parties, the list of vetted candidates, the policy heft and attract the talent to present themselves as a viable alternative government?</p>\n    <p>Then there is the cranking up of scrutiny they will now face, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce845w70g0yo\">such as this story from the BBC's Billy Kenber and Phil Kemp</a>.</p>\n    <p>They are taking on all of this and a lot more in the blink of an eye and it is far from certain it is do-able.</p>\n    <p>But with each passing month, their opponents treat with increasing credibility the possibility it could happen.</p>\n    <p>What we are witnessing, so often, in other parties right now is their reaction to that.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2ejlpdjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We are clear with Israel that this is no way to treat British Parliamentarians.\"</p>\n    <p>The two MPs were crossing into Israel from Jordan on Monday on a three-day visit organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) when they were stopped by Israeli authorities.</p>\n    <p>Opher told the BBC they were held in a passport office before being handed a \"legal form insisting that we leave the country\" and then \"escorted to a bus\" back to Jordan.</p>\n    <p>The Stroud MP said he was told they were not being admitted on \"public order\" grounds and that representations from the Foreign Office to Israeli authorities had been rejected.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"It's very disappointing.

They told me there's insufficient evidence to prosecute and he's agreed to pay it back,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Another source involved with the business account said they also understood the ex-MP's agreement to repay funds to be part of the reason the police had closed the investigation.</p>\n    <p>Menzies is not thought to have found employment since he stood down as an MP but the Conservative party confirmed they had given him a hardship loan which is understood to be a five-figure sum.</p>\n    <p>He was first elected in 2010. He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.</p>\n    <p>The money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.</p>\n    <p>In December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.</p>\n    <p>He claimed it was \"a matter of life and death\", she has said, with men holding him in a London flat and refusing to release him unless he paid up.</p>\n    <p>The former MP subsequently denied the men in the flat he labelled \"bad people\" were sex workers.</p>\n    <p>A source close to him instead told The Times that he'd met a man on an online dating website, subsequently gone to the flat of a second man,<strong> </strong>and then been falsely accused of being sick before facing demands for a large sum to pay for cleaning.</p>\n    <p>However, one of the men present at the flat has admitted they had agreed to have sex with Menzies for payment.</p>\n    <p>The man, who is Brazilian, advertises himself as a \"high-class male escort\" and said he had participated in a \"party\" with Menzies and several other escorts.</p>\n    <p>The gathering lasted from Wednesday night to Friday morning, with Menzies absent from a full day of parliamentary work.</p>\n    <p>At its conclusion, Menzies didn't have sufficient funds to pay his bill, which amounted to more than £14,000, according to an account he later gave a close aide.</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian man denied that Menzies had ever been locked in but said there were \"lots of other guys\" and the then-MP \"hadn't paid anyone\".</p>\n    <p>He said he was not aware that Menzies was a politician and when informed of this added that he was \"surprised [b]ut that's his problem, I have nothing to do with it\".</p>\n    <p>\"My contact with him was just for work and ended there,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>As well as telephoning Ms Fieldhouse to demand money from the campaign funds account, Menzies summoned a male aide in his 30s to travel from Manchester to London to meet him at the flat where the \"party\" had taken place.</p>\n    <p>The aide said he was also asked for money, and he and a family member ended up handing over around £1,500.</p>\n    <p>Menzies received a further £6,500 from his office manager. She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.</p>\n    <p>After meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.</p>\n    <p>The aide said that Menzies's office manager gave him £1,000 from the money she had been reimbursed from the local business group's account, but he was still owed £500 which the MP told him he couldn't afford to pay.</p>\n    <p>He alleged that Menzies instead told him he would arrange for a bonus payment to be made through his parliamentary staffing budget.</p>\n    <p>Ipsa, which investigated this claim as an allegation of fraud, found that Menzies had signed off a bonus payment for the aide \"a few days after the incident in question\". This was the only time the aide received a bonus and was described as being for work he had done on a wind farm application.</p>\n    <p>The bonus was for £700, amounting to around £500 after tax.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/w59ykwiqehvh/3YnHUeKx52oK5dWRUMHMqO/e318efae337c17e4a3abb339f7a10826/Closure_report_MM.pdf\">In a report on its investigation published on Tuesday</a>, Ipsa's compliance officer said that he had found the case \"not proven\".</p>\n    <p>He wrote that there was \"evidence of wrongdoing\", including the timing of the payment, but stated that the aide was \"non-committal\" in his statement to the police on whether it was for wind farm work or to reimburse him, and that there was a discrepancy over the amount because he'd claimed to be owed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>Another of Menzies's former staffers also told Ipsa the payment was legitimately for the aide's wind farm work.</p>\n    <p>The aide told the BBC that he had done work on a wind farm, but that was just the excuse Menzies used for the bonus which he told him was actually to reimburse him for the money he had lent him to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They are both smiling.\"/>\n    <p>More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on<strong> </strong>the government's approach to tackling addiction.</p>\n    <p>Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.</p>\n    <p>The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to correct data and it is understood ministers are now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.</p>\n    <p>A former senior civil servant said fewer people might have died if drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.</p>\n    <p>Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.</p>\n    <p>The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.</p>\n    <p>Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.</p>\n    <p>Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.</p>\n    <p>The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.</p>\n    <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the most senior civil servant at the Home Office between 2017 and 2020, told the BBC it was \"quite possible\" that fewer people would have died, if the government's drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It really does matter, first of all the level of attention given to these issues, but then specifically it will affect decisions on how much funding to put into health-related programmes, treatment programmes, or into different bits of the criminal justice system.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.</p>\n    <p>His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Caulfield is the 15th former Tory MP to join the party.</p>\n    <p>The latest defection comes after Danny Kruger, who sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce802dmgnyro\">became the first sitting Tory MP to defect on Monday</a>.</p>\n    <p>Caulfield told GB News: \"The [Reform] party needs a lot of experience of people who know the system and can talk about this.\"</p>\n    <p>\"If you are Conservative right-minded, then the future is Reform.

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’. This could well lead to an early-Autumn pullback in equity markets ahead of the next Fed meeting.”</p>\n<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire has suffered a blow from ratings agency Fitch overnight.</p>\n<p>Fitch has downgraded INEOS Group to ‘BB-’, with a negative outlook, down from BB. That’s a one-notch fall, to the 13th place on Fitch’s scale of credit worthiness, and still leaves Ineos ranked as ‘non-investment grade’.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision, Fitch points out that Ineos is increasingly highly leveraged, due to the “weak chemical market” and high spending on a new ethane cracker in the Port of Antwerp.</p>\n<p>Fitch also predicts that Ineos’s revenue to grow by 2% on average in 2025-2029, after growing 9% in 2024.</p>\n<p>A lower credit rating implies a higher risk of default, or debt restructuring, and can result in higher borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>A dried sunflower field in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian</p>\n<p>Last summer’s extremely hot weather was not great for the European and Ukrainian sunflower crop.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian and European sunflower oil prices have jumped, Bloomberg reports, as forecasters expect low yields in the country and limited production across the continent.</p>\n<p>That’s because the hot, dry summer hampered crop development.</p>\n<p>There are forecasts that Europe could see its worst sunflower harvest in a decade, while harvesting in Ukraine is slow following a drought this year.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, sunflower yields are expected to fall below the five-year average “largely due to the drought in the south, where most sunflower cultivation takes place,” the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a report.</p>\n<p>Europe is facing similar challenges, with top producer France expecting output to drop 15% below the five-year average, according to figures from the French agriculture ministry.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, retail sales were stronger than expected last month – which might deter the Federal Reserve from a surprisingly hefty interest rate cut tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Spending at retail and food services sites jumped by 0.6% month-on-month in August, and were 5% higher than in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Economists had expected a smaller rise, of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>It’s an encouraging sign for US economic growth, but could also encourage Fed policymakers to vote for a quarter-point cut to interest rates, rather than a larger, half-point cut.</p>\n<p>U.S. retail sales stronger than expected. Hindrance for a 50 bp cut tomorrow? #retail</p>\n<p>Spending at “nonstore retailers” (ie, internet shopping) were up 10.1% year-on-year, while spending at food service and drinking places rose 6.5% compared with a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Britain’ Competition and Markets Authority has launched a merger inquiry into payments provider Global Payments’ $24.25bn acquisition of rival Worldpay.</p>\n<p>The CMA will examine whether the deal, announed in April, could lessen competition in UK markets.</p>\n<p>The CMA has set a deadline of November 11 to reach its Phase 1 decision.</p>\n<p>It’s a year since former Italian PM Mario Draghi’s landmark report, which warned that the EU risked “agonising decline” without an €800bn investment boost.</p>\n<p>Today, Draghi has warned that Europe was “in a harder place” than one year ago, and suggested that Europe actually needs annual investments of nearly €1,200bn, up from €800bn last year, with increasing demand for defence.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/16/uk-wage-growth-slows-jobs-market-cools-business-live-news-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <h2>What is the triple lock?</h2>\n    <p>The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">2.5%.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How many people get the state pension?</h2>\n    <p>There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.</p>\n    <p>People born after those dates claim the new state pension.</p>\n    <p>The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.</p>\n    <h2>What is the rise from next April?</h2>\n    <p>It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.</p>\n    <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">annual growth in earnings was 4.7%</a> for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.</p>\n    <p>The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">It was 3.8% in July</a> and is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.</p>\n    <p>The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.</p>\n    <h2>Is the triple lock popular?</h2>\n    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.</p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/uk-public-finances-obr-national-debt-gdp\">cost about three times more than initially expected</a> and suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.</p>\n    <p>Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.</p>\n    <p>Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.</p>\n    <h2>Could the triple lock be ditched?</h2>\n    <p>The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.</p>\n    <p>The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.</p>\n    <p>“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”</p>\n    <p>He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.</p>\n    <p>Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.</p>\n    <p>“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.</p>\n    <p>“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n    <p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n    <p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n    <p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n    <p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n    <p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners,” he said. “It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n    <p>The latest figures are expected to translate into an annual rise worth more than £500 for those on the new state pension, which would increase from £230.25 a week to £241.05 a week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 a week to £184.75.</p>\n    <p>Successive governments have committed to the triple lock since it was first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">introduced by George Osborne in 2010</a>, despite criticism that protecting pensioner incomes comes with a costly price tag for the public purse and risks fuelling intergenerational inequalities.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that state pension costs will rise from about 5% of GDP now to about 8% by the 2070s. Half of the increase is driven by the triple lock, at a time of rising pressure on other areas of spending and social care.</p>\n    <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called for the policy to be scrapped. Heidi Karjalainen, a senior research economist at the thinktank, said: “The triple lock has so far been much costlier than initially expected, and it creates a lot of uncertainty in terms of future spending.</p>\n    <p>“If the economy is doing well then it won’t cost more than increasing the state pension in line with average earnings growth, whereas in volatile periods it can become very costly – as we have seen in the last decade and a half.”</p>\n    <p>It comes as official figures showed the UK’s jobs market has continued to cool, amid a slowdown in annual pay growth and rising redundancies.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said annual growth in regular earnings excluding bonuses slowed to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the three months to June, matching the forecasts of City economists.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The official unemployment rate was unchanged on the previous month in July, at 4.7%, the highest level in four years.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have complained since Reeves’s first autumn budget that her £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a> and 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” would force them to cut jobs and raise prices for consumers.</p>\n    <p>Economists said there was clear evidence of the jobs market cooling. Separate figures from HMRC showed a decline in the number of workers on company payrolls of 8,000, matching City forecasts.</p>\n    <p>After taking account of inflation, annual growth in regular pay was 1.2% in the three months to July, down from 1.5%.</p>\n    <p>Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget. However, business leaders have warned a weaker growth outlook will make it harder for her to raise taxes without further harming the economy.</p>\n    <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. “[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p>\n    <p>Strong wage growth has caused a headache for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> by stoking inflationary pressures, putting further interest rate cuts at risk after four reductions in the past year. However, a deeper slowdown in the jobs market could show the economy is deteriorating, supporting faster rate cuts.</p>\n    <p>The Bank is expected to keep its base rate unchanged at 4% at its next policy meeting on Thursday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-25\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p>\n    <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p>\n    <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p>\n    <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p>\n    <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p>\n    <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p>\n    <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p>\n    <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p>\n    <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p>\n    <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p>\n    <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p>\n    <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>On Sunday, Russia released images of its launch of a 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile from a frigate in the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, near NATO borders. The launch comes against a backdrop of rising tensions with the West, just days after <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/poland-shoots-down-russian-drones/\">several Russian drones</a> violated the airspace of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member countries Poland and Romania.</p>\n    <p>The Zircon test is part of the Zapad 2025 joint maneuvers with Belarus, a week of military exercises aimed at assessing defensive and coordination capabilities between the two allied countries. It also serves to show that Russia's military force has not lost its strength, despite heavy losses more than three years after the start of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/putin-nuclear-threat-ukraine-war-escalation/\">invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the video originally shared on Telegram, the crew aboard the frigate Admiral Golovko fires the Zircon at a target in the Barents Sea, an area bounded to the west by the Norwegian Sea. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the target was destroyed in a direct hit by its hypersonic missile, which can reach a distance of up to 1,000 kilometers and travel at Mach 9—nine times the speed of sound.</p>\n    <p>The images also show exercises with Sukoi Su-34 supersonic fighter-bombers, a two-seater fighter-bomber that can carry up to eight tons of armament and can fly up to 2,485 miles (4,000 kilometers) without refueling (or more than 4,350 miles, or 7,000 km, with external tanks).</p>\n    <p>There is evidence that Russia has employed hypersonic missiles against civilian targets in Ukraine, such as the Zircon or Kinzhal, which are virtually impossible to intercept. This is not only because of their speed, but also because of their maneuvering capabilities, allowing them to change course mid-flight to evade defense systems (albeit in a limited way).</p>\n    <h2>Deliberate Provocation or Accident?</h2>\n    <p>This week, NATO set off international alarms due to a series of Russian drone incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, a violation that had not been recorded so far in the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/electronic-warfare-russia-ukraine/\">Russia-Ukraine war</a>, at least not on this scale. On September 10, at least 19 drones from Russia invaded Polish airspace, being intercepted and shot down by NATO fighters with no major damage on the ground. The incident was described by the Polish government as an \"unprecedented violation\" and a “large-scale provocation,” expressions shared by <a href=\"https://es.wired.com/articulos/rusia-quiere-colocar-armas-nucleares-en-el-espacio-advierte-jefe-de-la-otan\">Mark Rutte</a>, NATO's secretary general.</p>\n    <p>Poland then invoked Article 4 of the NATO Charter, which establishes a mechanism for consultation between NATO members “to exchange views and information and discuss issues before reaching agreement and taking action.” Following this debate among member countries, they launched Operation Eastern Sentinel, a military initiative to strengthen the defensive posture on the alliance's eastern flank through the deployment of advanced fighters and defense systems, among other measures, to counter missile and drone threats.</p>\n    <p>The alerts were triggered again on September 13, when Romania detected a drone, allegedly from Russia, in its airspace. Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace generated widespread international condemnation. The United States expressed support for the affected countries. “We consider this an unacceptable, regrettable and dangerous event,” said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. “No doubt the drones were intentionally launched. The question is whether they were intended to enter Poland.” The Russian government claimed it was not targeting Poland, while Belarus suggested the drones deviated from their initial trajectory.</p>\n    <p>Notwithstanding the attempts to offer explanations, the joint Zapad 2025 military exercises between Russia and Belarus do little to reduce tensions in Eastern Europe. Although both nations insist that the exercises are defensive in nature, the proximity of the exercises to NATO borders, as well as tests of hypersonic missiles in the Arctic, raise new concerns among Atlantic Alliance member countries.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russia-hypersonic-missile-test-nato-borders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The incident made him reconsider the years he had spent reporting on the lives cut short by gun violence — and the stress it had put on his body.</p>\n    <p>\"For the first time really, I had to look deep and engage with what was truly bearing down on my heart,\" he says. \"And for me that had been more than a decade of telling stories of Black death and survival.\"</p>\n    <p>As a reporter in Trenton, Philadelphia and New Orleans, Lee covered the deaths of young men who looked like him. The victims were \"wearing my same sneakers, same haircut,\" he says. \"And you have to wrestle with seeing yourself in some ways, repeatedly gunned down, your body repeatedly falling. Tears for your death over and over and again.\"</p>\n    <p>Lee's new memoir, <i>A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America</i>, is part history, and part personal turning point. He traces the bloody history Black Americans have with firearms, recalls gun violence in his own youth and follows his ancestors' path back to Ghana. </p>\n    <p>The book reads like a plea for people to see the humanity of those lost to gun violence — and for this country to care enough to act.</p>\n    <p>\"We have an opportunity and we still have this opportunity to be the great nation that we've professed,\" Lee says. \"I'm not a policy maker. I don't profess to be an expert in gun policy. But what I do believe is that until we break our lust for these guns, nothing will change.\"</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1650x2550+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F66%2F8ac03d97466dac0623471ca1c01f%2F9781250098016.jpg\" alt=\"A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America, Trymaine Lee\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On President Trump's comments about the violence in majority-Black cities</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hearing the president talk about Chicago and Baltimore and other cities, and he goes on to talk about how people in these communities were \"<a href=\"https://x.com/barrie4council/status/1963252762944143506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1963252762944143506%7Ctwgr%5E2e3b618ba1118b0fcf9919e8b3992e510e09ea24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fprofessor-why-trumps-born-to-be-criminals-comment-shou-2000060818\">born to be criminal[s</a>].\" The violence is innate, right? There's something in these people that makes them inherently violent, and the gun is just their tool. </p>\n    <p>But I think one of the biggest things that people miss or don't fully understand is that there is a direct pipeline from a slew of places with super lax gun laws that are poured right into Chicago. And that every one of these guns starts legally. And so along the pipeline, from the factory to the wholesale market, to the retail market, to stores, to gun shows, there are all these places where guns are siphoned off by the so-called good guys with guns. And so while there is violence in Chicago and there is criminality in Chicago, there's criminality that happens long before then to allow these guns to pour into these cities in ecosystems and environments already [twisted] and bound by so much systemic violence and so much lack and so much hunger, and so much trauma that folks are carrying.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On speaking to the mothers of Black men and boys who were shot and killed</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There was this string of killings, starting with like Trayvon Martin, and I got close enough to the families where they trusted me to tell their stories. In the middle of all the noise, I had a direct line to most of these families. And the look in a mother's eyes in particular who has lost a son to murder or violence, it's like nothing you've ever seen. And I still see those eyes. I've never been able to remove those eyes, right? The pain that you see in them, the ocean of emotion welling up in them. And that no matter what we do, all the humanizing, all of the, you know, making sense of the systems and the police and the law and all those things will not bring their child back.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the importance of showing respect to the victims of violence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>And the actual process of gathering the information for your report is also tough because you have ask dumb questions. \"What did you see? What did you hear? What was it like the last time you talked to them?\" Questions that are intrusive and at the worst moment in someone's life. And then you're asking for a picture, right? And then, you're over there talking to the police.</p>\n    <p>There's something exploitative by nature: I'm getting so much more out of this than you are. But I always wanted to do it humanely and with great respect. And then you have to take that back to the newsroom. And I literally had an editor once — it was after a shooting and one young person was killed and I think another one was wounded — and he said, \"Oh, that's just a garden-variety killing.\" He described the killing of a young teenager. And mind you, we don't have any context to the situation. ... We don't know how, why, who. We don't anything. But this was so routine that it wasn't worth covering. \"Don't worry about it, it's garden variety.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling with the notion of \"objectivity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The kind of objectivity that we're so often taught in this practice is a blindness. It's like a convenient ignoring of what you actually see. I think what's more appropriate is fairness. And that objectivity in that notion, it's an arm's length from your subject matter. And I never fully believed in that part. I think you have to have your facts right. I think that you have to be fair to people on as many sides as there are. But the notion of objectivity never rang solid for me.</p>\n    <p>What I managed to do, and I hope I continue to do in putting shape to the experiences of people, is going to the people and telling their story as openly and honestly as possible, and painting the picture, and bringing people into their experiences. And even when it's painful, giving a little bit of that pain for everybody to hold. Hold a little of this. If she has to hold some; you have to hold some too.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On tracing a gun from manufacturer to use</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It was so important, I think, to connect the dots between what's happening in factory towns in Massachusetts where these guns are produced, to the communities where these are so easily bought and sold with very little regulation, in the South mostly, to how they end up in Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit and Philadelphia … to show that there is no disconnect, that it's one long string, and that no one is left off of the broad ripple of impact here.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

In 2015, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. And in 2019, he won the National Book Award for his collection <i>Sight Lines. </i></p>\n    <p>In the announcement, acting Librarian of Congress Robert R.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Tory MP and shadow minister Danny Kruger defects to Reform</h1>\n    <p>Conservative MP Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK.</p>\n    <p>Kruger has been an MP since 2019, and sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister.</p>\n    <p>\"The Conservatives are over,\" he told a press conference, sitting alongside Reform party leader Nigel Farage.</p>\n    <p>Kruger said he had been \"honoured\" to be asked to help Reform prepare for government, and said he hoped that Farage would be the next prime minister.</p>\n    <p>The East Wiltshire MP - who has said he would not be triggering a by-election - said the Conservatives were no longer the main party of opposition.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"There have been moments when I have been very proud to belong to the Tory party\", but added: \"The rule of our time in office was failure.</p>\n    <p>\"Bigger government, social decline, lower wages, higher taxes and less of what ordinary people actually wanted.\"</p>\n    <p>He added: \"This is my tragic conclusion, the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition to the left.\"</p>\n    <p>Although he said he had \"great regard\" for Badenoch, he said the Tory party had a \"toxic brand\", adding: \"We have had a year of stasis and drift and the sham unity that comes from not doing anything bold or difficult or controversial.\"</p>\n    <p>Describing his move leaving a party he has been a member of for 20 years as \"personally painful\", he said his \"mission\" with Reform would be to \"not just to overthrow the current system, it is to restore the system we need\".</p>\n    <p>Responding to the news of the defection, Badenoch said: \"Danny has made his case very clear, that this is not about me.</p>\n    <p>\"I can't be distracted by that, and I'm not going to get blown off course by these sort of incidents.</p>\n    <p>\"I know this is the sort of thing that is going to happen while a party is changing. I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.</p>\n    <p>However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.</p>\n    <p>His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Green Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Listen to James read this article </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.</p>\n<p>All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.</p>\n<p>This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.</p>\n<p>There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.</p>\n<p>And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.</p>\n<h2>How Windsor became 'Trumpton'</h2>\n<p>For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.</p>\n<p>Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.</p>\n<p>For Palace officials, attention to detail is all.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.</p>\n<p>It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.</p>\n<p>\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider.</p>\n<p>\"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".</p>\n<p>King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.</p>\n<p>Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.</p>\n<h2>'Pressure to make this massive'</h2>\n<p>So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.</p>\n<p>The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.</p>\n<p>\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.</p>\n<p>The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)</p>\n<p>For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"</p>\n<p>Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"</p>\n<h2>The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests</h2>\n<p>Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"</p>\n<p>Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.</p>\n<p>They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.</p>\n<p>\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"</p>\n<p>For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.</p>\n<h2>Serious business behind the pageantry</h2>\n<p>Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.</p>\n<p>Ministers hope to complete a deal to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yp5qzeer6o\">exclude UK steel</a> and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.</p>\n<p>The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>\n<p>This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".</p>\n<p>All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.</p>\n<p>The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.</p>\n<p>\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.</p>\n<p>\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"</p>\n<p>Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.</p>\n<p>\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"</p>\n<h2>The Mandelson question</h2>\n<p>For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p>The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?</p>\n<p>Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.</p>\n<p>According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.</p>\n<p>It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.</p>\n<p>Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Trump will later travel to Chequers on Thursday for a business reception, working lunch and press conference with Keir Starmer.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, ministers will be hoping that Tuesday’s roundtable with financial bosses from the City and Wall Street will secure further foreign investments that can generate growth and positive headlines before a challenging budget in November.</p>\n    <p>That is expected to include a £100bn investment from Blackstone, the alternative asset manager known for its private equity investments and which manages about $1.2tn (£880bn) worth of assets. It is due to confirm the investment out of the $500bn it is due to invest in Europe over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>Sky News, which broke news of Blackstone’s investment on Monday morning, said the funds would involve private equity buyouts as well as other forms of investment.</p>\n    <p>Blackstone, which is led by Steve Schwarzman, is marking 25 years in London this year, having launched operations in the City in 2000. The office currently employs 650 people, and has about $100bn already invested in the UK. That includes real estate investments, including a datacentre in the north of England. Schwarzman told Bloomberg in June that “the UK government has been really helpful, really focused to make that happen”.</p>\n    <p>Blackstone’s investment pledge will be welcome news, helping to offset challenging decisions in the upcoming autumn budget.

Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s ailing property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.</p>\n    <p>China’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports which have been dealt a blow by the trade war with the US.

Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p>\n    <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p>\n    <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p>\n    <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p>\n    <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p>\n    <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p>\n    <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p>\n    <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p>\n    <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p>\n    <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/aldis-uk-boss-warns-shoppers-face-higher-food-prices-if-budget-heaps-extra-costs-on-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Back then, Cáceres was planning to become a civil engineer. \"While I was studying, I started illustrating,\" she said. \"And I started illustrating Tobi.\"</p>\n    <p>Without ever taking a single art class, Cáceres graduated with an engineering degree — but she pursued work as an artist. In 2016, as Venezuela's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031871225/bonus-venezuelas-rise-and-fall\">socioeconomic crisis</a> deepened, Caceres moved to the United States and found a position as a textile designer.</p>\n    <p>\"When I moved here, I was working designing for other people. I wasn't doing anything for myself,\" she said. \"I didn't have time to do anything for myself.\"</p>\n    <p>Worst of all, she had to leave Tobi back in Venezuela. She missed him immensely, and she craved a creative outlet to help her through all the transitions she was going through. So she started a project: Every day, for a whole year, she would draw a different dog. She called the project \"A Dog A Day Keeps the Stress Away,\" and the first dog she drew in January 2018 was, of course, Tobi.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4284x5712+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fba%2Fea1a25754d5d89e48c9345dddf20%2Fandrea-caceres-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Courtesy of Andrea Cáceres\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <p>The illustrations took off. Soon, Cáceres started getting commissioned to draw people's pets and paint murals for cafes and vet clinics. Best of all, after more than two years apart, she saved enough to bring Tobi to New York. His original flight from Venezuela got cancelled – Tobi had to fly from Valencia to Caracas to Panama to Miami and then – finally – to New York City, where Cáceres was waiting for him.</p>\n    <p>\"The moment he saw me, he started crying,\" she recalled. \"Then I started crying, and everybody started crying.\"</p>\n    <p><i>Hello,Tobi!</i> is a portrait of this period when she first introduced Tobi to Harlem.

The story reveals that Maxwell and Epstein remained deeply intertwined long after she claimed to have stepped away from his orbit. The correspondence details her role in managing his finances, property, and personal relationships, as well as efforts to discredit women who accused them of abuse. Among the revelations: Maxwell opened a foreign bank account using Epstein’s address, was listed as a director at one of his main companies, and even coordinated the distribution of luxury gifts to associates and victims alike.</p>\n<p>The emails are a stark reminder of Maxwell’s complicity in Epstein’s crimes at a time when she is widely seen as courting favor with the Trump administration. Beyond advising Epstein on plea negotiations and scheming to discredit accusers, Maxwell appears to have remained the linchpin in his social network, connecting him to politicians, celebrities, and business titans, according to the emails reviewed by Bloomberg. The archive reveals her helping arrange gifts and payments—from a $71,000 Lexus for a lawyer to lingerie for teenage girls who later testified against them—while simultaneously navigating her own mounting exposure.</p>\n<p>Against the background of Trump officials weighing whether to release the sealed “Epstein files” and speculation over a potential pardon, the correspondence positions Maxwell not only as Epstein’s fixer but someone who has long worked to secure her standing with those in power.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/the-wiretap/2025/09/09/how-ice-is-using-fake-cell-towers-to-spy-on-peoples-phones/\">ICE Deploys “Stingray” Tech, Renewing Surveillance Concerns</a>\n    </h2>\n<p>In a newly unsealed warrant reviewed by Forbes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was authorized to use a cell-site simulator—a controversial surveillance tool that tracks phones by mimicking real cell towers—in an effort to locate a Venezuelan national. Initial location data narrowed the man to a 30-block area, prompting ICE to request more precise tracking using the device. It’s unclear if he was ever caught.</p>\n<p>The case highlights ICE’s reliance on surveillance tools long criticized by civil liberties groups for sweeping up swaths of data from bystanders alongside targets. In May, procurement records show ICE spent nearly $1 million on “cell site simulator vehicles,” building on a 2024 contract launched under the previous administration. ICE also reportedly maintains a $4.4 million deal with Harris Corporation, maker of the notorious “Stingray,” which has become an eponym for nearly all cell-site simulators used by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>The devices work by tricking cell phones into believing they’re real cell towers, allowing police to identify a target device and track its movements far more precisely than the broad geolocation data available from phone companies. While a normal trace may only provide a rough radius or general direction, with a stingray—and a few attachments—police can shrink the search to a specific block, home, or apartment. The devices are controversial because in certain modes, they don’t just capture the target’s phone signal—they scoop up data from every device in range, sweeping up information about bystanders’ calls without their knowledge or consent.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-warns-hidden-radios-may-be-embedded-solar-powered-highway-infrastructure-2025-09-10/\">US Transportation Department Report Warns of Hidden Radios in Highway Infrastructure</a>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/jeffrey-epsteins-yahoo-inbox-revealed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>From December, Australians will need to verify their age in order to access pornography sites and other sites hosting adult content.</p>\n<p>How will it work, what will we need to do, and can we avoid it?</p>\n<h2>What’s changing?</h2>\n<p>The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, announced this week that industry-designed codes covering adult content and extreme violence or self-harm content would go into force in two tranches – in December this year and March next year.<br/>\n The first tranche in December will cover search engines, server hosts and internet service providers (which are only required to offer family-friendly internet filters to customers).</p>\n<p>The second tranche, in March, will cover websites, social media, storage services, AI chatbots, app stores and equipment providers like phone makers or console developers.</p>\n<h2>Is this related to the under-16s social media ban?</h2>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/03/australia-porn-age-verification-technology-government\">process was under way</a> before the Albanese government decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/under-16s-ban-how-hard-will-it-be-for-australian-social-media-users-to-prove-their-age\">legislate to ban under 16s from social media</a>, but some of the changes will come in around the same time, and the methods used to confirm ages will be the same.<br/>\n  Social media sites will need to both restrict under-16s from accessing adult content, but also by March prevent under-18s from being able to access adult content on their services. Some, like Meta, already do not allow adult content, while others like X do.</p>\n<h2>What will be required?</h2>\n<p>It will mean many of these services will need to check the ages of their users. If you want to visit a porn site, search for unfiltered search results, look at adult content on sites like X or Reddit, download apps meant for 18+ users like dating apps, use an AI chatbot that can generate sexually explicit content or use a messaging service or online game rated 18+, those services will need to be assured you’re over 18.</p>\n<p>For ISPs and device makers, the requirements are around providing options such as child-friendly accounts rather than verifying ages.</p>\n<p>The eSafety commissioner has argued this is not an “unprecedented change” to the way Australians use the internet, but for searches it at least formalises practices already in place, and something other parts of the world are doing at the same time.</p>\n<p>Companies that fail to comply could face fines of up to $49.5m.</p>\n<h2>How will these companies verify people’s ages?</h2>\n<p>The eSafety commissioner has said the method of verification is up to those individual companies, as long as it is deemed an “appropriate age-assurance measure”. The commissioner has outlined such measures could include:</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Confirmation by a parent of age</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Photo ID</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Facial age estimation</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Credit card checks</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Digital identity wallets or systems</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Age inference by examining a user’s behaviour, interests, or other factors such as the length of time since account registration</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Third-party age-assurance vendors</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Most of these methods were examined in the age-assurance technology trial, which released its report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/age-assurance-technology-trial-report-australia-under-16-social-media-ban-some-errors-inevitable\">at the end of August</a>.</p>\n<h2>So, adult sites could be forced to collect photo IDs for everyone who wants to look at porn?</h2>\n<p>In theory, yes, if they decide to use that method.</p>\n<p>The sites users pay for will likely cover one-off age checks through people paying via credit card – eg Onlyfans – but for the free sites like Pornhub, they will be required to implement one of the other methods.</p>\n<p>The eSafety commissioner has said that the companies must “minimise the collection of personal information” and comply with privacy laws, but there are no restrictions beyond those that exist for other companies regarding the collection of personal information.</p>\n<h2>Will it be a one-off check or multiple verifications?</h2>\n<p>The eSafety commissioner’s office has said some services may allow one-off age checks, while others might require session-by-session checks.</p>\n<p>“Providers must balance effectiveness with usability and privacy,” eSafety said.</p>\n<h2>Why is the government cracking down on pornography?</h2>\n<p>Inman Grant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/02/fears-online-safety-law-could-censor-all-adult-content-and-force-sex-workers-off-internet\">told Guardian Australia in 2021</a> – when the online safety bill was before the parliament under the former Coalition government – that, amid sex worker fears the legislation would force them off the internet, she didn’t intend to use her powers under the legislation to go after consensual adult pornographic material online.</p>\n<p>“My role as a regulator is to protect all Australians from online harm, it’s not to throttle the sex industry,” she said at the time. “What happens between consenting adults is not my concern, as long as it’s not harming others.”<br/>\n  However, in a <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/industry/codes/faq-access-to-online-porn-and-other-adult-content\">frequently asked questions</a> for the changes released this week, the eSafety commissioner’s office said that the federal government has decided pornography is legal but restricted its access to adults.<br/>\n  ”Age restrictions for pornography and other high-impact material are a lot like those for cigarettes, alcohol and public gambling,” eSafety said. “They allow the community to protect children from things that might endanger their immediate safety or harm their long-term health and development.”<br/>\n  The office highlighted <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/research/young-peoples-attitudes-towards-online-pornography-and-age-assurance\">its study</a> which found about 10% of children have accidentally stumbled on porn online by the age of 10, increasing to almost 30% by 13.</p>\n<h2>Will people be able to use VPNs to get around the age verification?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/13/australians-will-verify-age-photo-id-facial-recognition-to-watch-pornography-from-december\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Inside was an American flag that had flown over the Capitol — sent as a gesture of appreciation for Xie Xide, the renowned Chinese scientist who had recently died. Xie had played a key role in fostering cultural and scientific exchanges between the two countries.</p><p>Stories like this are almost inconceivable today in both the United States and China, as the tone of their bilateral relations has fundamentally shifted. But in the new book, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-encounters-with-america/9780231217194/\"> Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China</a>, profiles of 12 Chinese individuals remind us of the optimism that once defined the two countries' engagement. This optimism has faded away in recent years. </p><p>The dozen profiles in this edited volume highlight the positive aspects of U.S.-China exchange, which began in earnest after diplomatic relations were established in 1979. These accounts range from academics like Xie Xide, to environmental activists like Ma Tianjie, and diplomats like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-f3ada042a03faf8523ff08d270e5e051\">Ji Chaozhu</a>, who served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972.</p><p>Today, as the U.S. and China find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories may be interpreted differently, depending on the reader's own views on the once-popular engagement policy. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, however brief it may have been.</p><p>The book's co-editors, Deborah Davis — a leading sociologist on China — and Terry Lautz, author of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/americans-in-china-9780197512838\"> Americans in China</a>, argue that the book underscores the value of finding common ground. They express concern that both Americans and Chinese are losing sight of their shared interests and the benefits that have come from cooperation.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fea%2F385436a74672a17e60f0bcc1667d%2Famericansinchina-cover.jpg\" alt=\"AmericansInChina Cover.jpg\"/><p>In an email exchange with NPR, the editors sent joint responses to questions about the issues addressed in the book. Here is an edited version of the exchange.</p><p><strong>NPR: You said you were concerned that both Americans and Chinese had lost sight of their shared interests. Why, in your view, did this happen?  </strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz:</strong> China's unexpected arrival as a major economic and military power triggered a downward spiral in the U.S.-China relations. Washington saw China's ascent and its hardline diplomacy as a challenge to the existing world order. Beijing viewed the United States as a threat to its interests, especially the PRC's claim to the island of Taiwan. This new power dynamic undermined the long-held assumption that Sino-American engagement would lead to positive, peaceful change. Instead, it produced a climate of fear and distrust. The aim of our book is to show the benefits of cooperation and mutual understanding despite our differences.</p><p><strong>NPR: In short, how has encountering the U.S. changed these individuals —  and China itself?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>The impact varies over time. Those who returned to an impoverished China during the Cold War faced different challenges and had different motives from those who returned in the 1990s or 2000s when China was more open politically and prosperous. The consequences of their encounters also vary by occupation — from education, dance, and diplomacy to civil society, science, and sports.</p><p>Their life stories are remarkable. For example, Xie Xide, a renowned physicist who received her PhD from MIT in 1951, became the first woman president of a major Chinese research university in 1983. But she also spent years cleaning floors during the Cultural Revolution. Wang Jisi, one of China's most prominent America watchers, spent seven years herding sheep in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution before entering Peking University in 1978. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3726969\">Lang Ping</a>, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/07/04/6647713/pianist-has-passion-for-performing-new-music\">Peng-Peng Gong</a> was trained at the Juilliard School in New York but walked away from a lucrative career as an international concert pianist and returned to China as the resident composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014.

The Chinese Communist Party sent his family to New York City when he was a boy and by the time he returned to New China in 1950, after his sophomore year at Harvard, he could barely speak Chinese.</p><p>The Foreign Ministry sent Ji to make English transcripts of the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom during the Korean War. But because of his American background, it took several years before he could join the Party. He was \"sent down\" to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution but reemerged to interpret for Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai during President Nixon's trip in 1972 and accompanied Deng Xiaoping to the United States in 1979. There were times when he could have sought asylum abroad, but he remained patriotic, convinced that the Communist Party was the best choice for his country's future.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2560x1920+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2018%2F06%2F11%2Fap_7202281627.jpg\" alt=\"President Richard Nixon and China's Premier Chou En-lai pose together at Shanghai Airport before the Nixon departs for the United States on Feb. 28, 1972.\"/><p>\n                Ji Chaozhu (left) served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972.

Did this perspective resonate with any of the individuals you wrote about?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>From what we know of their public lives, none of them would say that engagement with the United States was a mistake— for themselves, for China, or China's relations with America. To the contrary, they came back from the U.S. with knowledge and skills that could be used to make China a strong modern nation. And that's exactly what they did. It was a complex process of adapting what they had learned to fit China's needs while working to improve China's understanding of the United States. All of them saw engagement as an opportunity to advance their careers and to enhance China's global status.</p><p><strong>NPR: Your book spans the Cold War, reconciliation, reform, engagement, and ends with globalization and cooperation. If you were to continue, who might you choose to profile in the current climate of rivalry and distrust?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>We would probably choose someone in science and technology. Take, for example, Abigail Coplin's chapter about Deng Xing Wang, a brilliant plant biologist who grew up in poverty in a farming village in Hunan province. When he left China for graduate study at University of California, Berkeley in 1985, no one could have imagined he would become a chaired professor at Yale University. And no one could have predicted that he would give that up and return to China to start his own company and direct a major research institute. While our governments may see \"American science\" and \"Chinese science\" as separate entities, Deng's story shows that cutting edge research thrives on cooperation as well as competition across national boundaries.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/g-s1-87796/chinese-encounters-with-america-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The direction of travel seemed set - and Mandelson would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>The even more uncomfortable factor is that last week the prime minister defended another colleague, Angela Rayner, when - you guessed it - the direction of travel in Westminster seemed set, and she would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">undermined the prime minister's own authority</a> and blown the chance of a quick autumn reset for Labour, when the party was desperately trying to turn the page.</p>\n<p>The more generous argument made by Sir Keir's allies - he's been let down by two different people in two different ways, and has had to front up to clean up their different messes.</p>\n<p>\"Keir is frustrated and a bit angry because he is having to deal with the conduct of others, rather than show what he is trying to do,\" one source says.</p>\n<p>Another says: \"He hired someone who didn't tell him the full truth.\"</p>\n<p>No 10 doesn't imagine that the damage of the last fortnight of farce is limited to those who have departed government.</p>\n<p>And as they absorb the scale of the embarrassment over Mandelson's friendship with Epstein, new details over who knew what - and when - are emerging all the time.</p>\n<p>Westminster sources have suggested the prime minister himself had raised questions about Mandelson's links with Epstein during an initial vetting process carried out by the Cabinet Office before he was given the job.</p>\n<p>But then he was checked out again by the Foreign Office once he'd been appointed.</p>\n<h2>So where did it all begin?</h2>\n<p>Even before Labour won the election in 2024 there had been a desire in Sir Keir's circle to look beyond the traditional diplomatic appointment for their ambassador to the White House, one of the government's plum jobs.</p>\n<p>They had noted how the former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was sent to DC and determined that a politician could be the right choice.</p>\n<p>With his experience as a trade commissioner, an impressive spider's web of contacts, and respected political nous, Mandelson was soon determined to be an excellent potential fit.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's powerful chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, believed there were only two qualified candidates for the role, and was enthusiastic about Mandelson.</p>\n<p>Before the final decision was made last autumn, the Cabinet Office was asked, as it would be for any such candidate, to consider whether he was fit to be offered the job.</p>\n<p>Already at that stage it was no secret Mandelson had been friends with Epstein, so it was obvious those links would need to be considered.</p>\n<p>I'm told a file on Mandelson from the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET), whose job it is to know where the bodies are buried in Whitehall, was presented to the prime minister that included information about his relationship with the disgraced millionaire.</p>\n<p>On reading this file, Sir Keir had three questions he wanted to clarify with the peer, a No 10 source tells me: Why had he continued his friendship with Epstein after he was first convicted and not broken contact with him?</p>\n<p>Why had he stayed at one of Epstein's houses when the financier was in jail?</p>\n<p>And was he a \"founding citizen\" of an ocean conservation charity that Epstein had backed?</p>\n<p>That trio of questions was put to Mandelson in an email from Sir Keir's chief of staff McSweeney on his behalf.</p>\n<p>The peer, I'm told, replied to those questions in an email in which Downing Street sources now say he was \"economical with the truth\".</p>\n<p>It's understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009 while Epstein was in prison. Another source confirmed that he told Downing Street he had not stayed there.</p>\n<p>Court documents revealed in 2023 Epstein told his private banker that Mandelson would be staying at the property. Mandelson has never explicitly denied or confirmed he did, although it has been reported that he had no recollection of doing so.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that none of those issues - the possible house stay, the charity, or the continued friendship - were discovered during the vetting process. They had been reported in previous years.</p>\n<p>But the guarantees relayed to the prime minister by Mandelson were considered sufficient to be worth the gamble of giving him the job.</p>\n<p>Once the appointment was then made, sources suggest the \"developed vetting\" process then kicked in, under the auspices of the Foreign Office.</p>\n<p>The normal process for government appointments is dependent on the job being given and the sensitivity of the material and information to be handled.</p>\n<p>But there is scarcely a job with a higher level of trust required than the White House ambassador, given the two countries' links on security, defence, trade and intelligence.</p>\n<p>I'm told nothing was flagged to No 10 as a result of the DV process, which would have involved an in-person interview which in this case, \"ought to have been completely forensic, but they must have used the wrong lens,\" according to another senior figure.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PET file, Downing Street would not receive the results of such a process as a matter of course, even in an extremely high-profile appointment. The DV process is a standalone routine.</p>\n<p>And Downing Street sources insist that they weren't made aware of any problems, so everything went ahead.</p>\n<p>The upshot? Even though there were two different processes checking out Mandelson's background, which publicly was known to include dealings with a notorious wealthy sex offender, neither appear to have turned up anything major - nor the now notorious emails which investigative reporters were able to locate recently.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall insider told me it was \"staggering - either they skipped the process of any basic due diligence, or they did that process and missed the obvious questions\".</p>\n<p>\"No one involved in making the appointment cared enough to check whether all the risk had been identified in appointing a man who had twice previously had to resign over his judgement. Careless doesn't cover it.\"</p>\n<p>The government has repeatedly said this week that part of the problem was the messages between Mandelson and Epstein were from a defunct email address.</p>\n<p>Yet a senior Whitehall figure tells me it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done.</p>\n<p>Neither Downing Street nor the Cabinet Office wanted to comment.</p>\n<p>Until this week, it seemed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd1egrlj0mo\">No 10's calculated risk of appointing Mandelson</a> was paying off.</p>\n<p>Not just because US President Donald Trump appeared to enjoy his company, praising his \"beautiful accent\" on camera recently in the Oval Office, but also because the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8dnm4dv2zo\">UK had got its trade deal</a>.</p>\n<p>The state visit was all about to unfold in its pomp and glory. Sir Keir appeared, unlike many other global leaders, to have managed to build a warm and functional relationship with the most powerful man in the western world.</p>\n<p>All of that, at least partly down to the smooth talking and politicking of the ambassador.</p>\n<p>What he and No 10 were enjoying as a successful tenure was to be suddenly disrupted when the peer featured in what's known as the Epstein \"birthday book\". It features a cosy message - Mandelson branding Epstein his \"best pal\", and a photograph of the two in which Mandelson is wearing a bathrobe.</p>\n<p>And what was to prove more serious, reporters at the news agency Bloomberg managed to get hold of a cache of Epstein's emails, which included his communications with Mandelson over months and years.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to get ahead of the story, Mandelson predicted that a whole slew of contact between the two was about to emerge into public view - and he described the revelations to The Sun as \"very embarrassing\". This sent alarm bells clanging back in Whitehall.</p>\n<p>He hadn't shared the contents of the emails with Downing Street and had been \"dismissive, claiming there was nothing new\" in the stories emerging about his friendship with Epstein earlier in the week, sources suggest.</p>\n<p>But, by late on Tuesday, the government was aware that more damaging allegations were coming, and contacted the peer to ask what was going on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8j2d5xm78o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The manhunt for the shooter who killed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-obituary/\">conservative activist Charlie Kirk</a> ended Friday with a suspect taken into custody, authorities said.</p>\n<p>Utah’s Department of Public Safety and the FBI confirmed the arrest during a morning briefing, capping a two-day search that began after the 31-year-old podcaster and Turning Point USA cofounder was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shot-at-utah-valley-university-event/\">fatally shot at Utah Valley University</a> in Orem, Utah, on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Authorities identified the suspect as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson of Washington, Utah, after receiving a tip from a friend of Robinson’s family. Officials said the tip came late Thursday night, prompting agents to move quickly to locate and arrest him. A $100,000 reward for information leading to the identification and arrest of the shooter was announced Thursday.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump first announced the arrest in a live interview on Fox News, claiming, “With a high degree of certainty, we have him.”</p>\n<p>At a press briefing Friday, Utah governor Spencer Cox announced Robinson had been arrested in the early hours of September 12 after a family member reached out to a family friend, who contacted authorities. The friend told investigators that Robinson had hinted at his involvement in the shooting. The tip was relayed through local law enforcement to the FBI and Utah county investigators, who matched Robinson’s gray Dodge Challenger and clothing to campus surveillance footage from the day of the shooting. A family member also told investigators that Robinson spoke critically of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/charlie-kirk/\">Kirk</a>.</p>\n<p>Cox said Robinson’s roommate also cooperated, showing investigators Discord messages in which Robinson discussed retrieving and hiding a rifle, leaving it wrapped in a towel, monitoring the drop site, and engraving bullets.</p>\n<p>Later on Friday, Discord <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/charlie-kirk-shooter-manhunt-live-updates-rcna230762/rcrd88292?canonicalCard=true\">told NBC News</a> in a statement that the company “identified a Discord account associated with the suspect,” which Discord has now removed. However, the company said the discussion Cox cited did not involve that account.</p>\n<p>“The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages,” a Discord spokesperson told NBC News. “These were communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere.”</p>\n<p>FBI director Kash Patel outlined the bureau’s role in the investigation, stressing the speed of the response and coordination with Utah authorities. He said agents arrived on scene within 16 minutes of the shooting, secured the area alongside local police, and quickly began moving evidence to FBI labs in Quantico for analysis. “The FBI and our partners are proud to stand here today together to bring justice to the family of Charlie Kirk and honor his memory,” he said.</p>\n<p>Patel closed his remarks with a brief eulogy for Kirk, saying, “I’ll see you in Valhalla.”</p>\n<p>Beyond the Discord account mentioned by Cox, Robinson appears to have had virtually no online footprint that could be immediately identified in public or private databases. Internet users produced images they claimed came from family photo albums posted online, but the accounts of his immediate family members were shut down quickly, and these images couldn't be verified; none pointed to any obvious motive or ideology.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Utah State University confirmed that Robinson briefly attended the school for one semester in 2021.</p>\n<p>Investigators recovered a Mauser .30-caliber hunting rifle near the scene of the shooting, allegedly abandoned by the gunman as he fled into a wooded area. A spent round was found in the chamber, with three live cartridges in the magazine. Cox said Friday that the casings bore engraved inscriptions. They reportedly include memes to crude jokes, such as “if you read this, you are gay. LMAO.”</p>\n<p>Authorities say the shooter fired from a rooftop overlooking a courtyard where Kirk was hosting one of his trademark “prove me wrong” campus debates. Widely shared footage online shows Kirk addressing a question on mass shootings when a bullet suddenly strikes him in the neck.</p>\n<p>Roughly 3,000 people are estimated to have been in attendance. Millions more were confronted by gruesome footage of the incident online, in some cases autoplaying across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X, where researchers say efforts to combat the spread of violent content <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shot-videos-spread-social-media/\">have broadly declined</a>.</p>\n<p>The investigation unfolded at a moment when the FBI was already under fire. In recent weeks, the bureau has endured <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/lawsuit-three-former-fbi-leaders-say-they-were-fired-insufficient-loyalty-2025-09-10/\">sweeping dismissals</a> of senior and mid-level agents, moves alleged in <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284697/gov.uscourts.dcd.284697.1.0_1.pdf\">a lawsuit this week</a> to be politically motivated purges. The shake-ups are said to have sapped institutional knowledge and morale, signaling to agents that defying political directives could cost them their careers.</p>\n<p>The days after the shooting were marked by confusion. Within hours, state and federal officials issued <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/no-suspect-custody-charlie-kirk-shooting-after-hours-confusion-2025-09-11/\">conflicting accounts</a> of whether anyone had been detained. The FBI’s Patel briefly announced that a “subject” was in custody, only to later announce that the person had been released. Scrapped press conferences and uneven briefings fueled further uncertainty, with rampant speculation on TV news and social media rushing to fill the gaps in credible information.</p>\n<p>Far-right influencers and extremist groups took to posting the personal details of people <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/\">they accused of celebrating Kirk’s death</a>, triggering harassment campaigns and death threats. Within hours of the shooting, a website began compiling names, social media handles, and employers of accused offenders.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-identified-as-22-year-old-utah-man-tyler-robinson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.</p>\n<p>Sure, the clips you see in demo reels are cherry-picked to showcase a company’s models at the top of their game. But with the technology in the hands of more users than ever before—Sora and Veo 3 are available in the ChatGPT and Gemini apps for paying subscribers—even the most casual filmmaker can now knock out something remarkable.</p>\n<p>The downside is that creators are competing with AI slop, and social media feeds are filling up with faked news footage. Video generation also uses up a huge amount of energy, many times more than text or image generation.</p>\n<p>With AI-generated videos everywhere, let's take a moment to talk about the tech that makes them work.</p>\n<p>How do you generate a video?</p>\n<p>Let’s assume you’re a casual user. There are now a range of high-end tools that allow pro video makers to insert video generation models into their workflows. But most people will use this technology in an app or via a website. You know the drill: “Hey, Gemini, make me a video of a unicorn eating spaghetti. Now make its horn take off like a rocket.” What you get back will be hit or miss, and you’ll typically need to ask the model to take another pass or 10 before you get more or less what you wanted.</p>\n<p>So what’s going on under the hood? Why is it hit or miss—and why does it take so much energy? The latest wave of video generation models are what’s known as latent diffusion transformers. Yes, that’s quite a mouthful. Let’s unpack each part in turn, starting with diffusion.</p>\n<p>What’s a diffusion model?</p>\n<p>Imagine taking an image and adding a random spattering of pixels to it. Take that pixel-spattered image and spatter it again and then again. Do that enough times and you will have turned the initial image into a random mess of pixels, like static on an old TV set.</p>\n<p>A diffusion model is a neural network trained to reverse that process, turning random static into images. During training, it gets shown millions of images in various stages of pixelation. It learns how those images change each time new pixels are thrown at them and, thus, how to undo those changes.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that when you ask a diffusion model to generate an image, it will start off with a random mess of pixels and step by step turn that mess into an image that is more or less similar to images in its training set.</p>\n<p>But you don’t want any image—you want the image you specified, typically with a text prompt. And so the diffusion model is paired with a second model—such as a large language model (LLM) trained to match images with text descriptions—that guides each step of the cleanup process, pushing the diffusion model toward images that the large language model considers a good match to the prompt.</p>\n<p>An aside: This LLM isn’t pulling the links between text and images out of thin air. Most text-to-image and text-to-video models today are trained on large data sets that contain billions of pairings of text and images or text and video scraped from the internet (a practice many creators are very unhappy about). This means that what you get from such models is a distillation of the world as it’s represented online, distorted by prejudice (and pornography).</p>\n<p>It's easiest to imagine diffusion models working with images. But the technique can be used with many kinds of data, including audio and video. To generate movie clips, a diffusion model must clean up sequences of images—the consecutive frames of a video—instead of just one image.</p>\n<p>What’s a latent diffusion model?</p>\n<p>All this takes a huge amount of compute (read: energy). That’s why most diffusion models used for video generation use a technique called latent diffusion. Instead of processing raw data—the millions of pixels in each video frame—the model works in what’s known as a latent space, in which the video frames (and text prompt) are compressed into a mathematical code that captures just the essential features of the data and throws out the rest.</p>\n<p>A similar thing happens whenever you stream a video over the internet: A video is sent from a server to your screen in a compressed format to make it get to you faster, and when it arrives, your computer or TV will convert it back into a watchable video.</p>\n<p>And so the final step is to decompress what the latent diffusion process has come up with. Once the compressed frames of random static have been turned into the compressed frames of a video that the LLM guide considers a good match for the user’s prompt, the compressed video gets converted into something you can watch.</p>\n<p>With latent diffusion, the diffusion process works more or less the way it would for an image. The difference is that the pixelated video frames are now mathematical encodings of those frames rather than the frames themselves. This makes latent diffusion far more efficient than a typical diffusion model. (Even so, video generation still uses more energy than image or text generation. There’s just an eye-popping amount of computation involved.)</p>\n<p>What’s a latent diffusion transformer?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/12/1123562/how-do-ai-models-generate-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Take Lin-Manuel Miranda, a composer, lyricist, director and actor best known for creating the musical <i>Hamilton</i>. Not only has he won a \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation, but he's been called a genius in publications like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lin-manuel-miranda-ingenuity-awards-180957234/\"> Smithsonian Magazine</a>, </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/16/why-love-lin-manuel-miranda-crush-bim-adewunmi\">and</a></p><i>The</i><i>Guardian</i><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/yay-hamlet\">BuzzFeed</a>.</p><p>Genius implies something solitary, and we often think of it as innate. Even so, Miranda wasn't the best student when he was young; teachers weren't swooning over his early promise. As Miranda told Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, the author of a new biography, <i>Lin-Manuel Miranda: The Education of an Artist</i>: \"I was never the brightest student at Hunter College Elementary School, but I was good at making up songs, and I was good at making kids laugh, which is the only currency that matters when you are surrounded by people who are much smarter than you.\"</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and a visiting scholar at Portland State University, says that although Miranda is undeniably talented and works very, very hard, his superpower is that he cultivates, collaborates with — and is constantly learning from — a large group of creative friends.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner's new book traces Miranda's career from elementary school musicals, to writing and starring in Disney movies, to his concept album based on the cult-classic film <i>The Warriors</i>.</p><p>Miranda, who has <a href=\"https://x.com/Lin_Manuel/status/667845524171661312\">Puerto Rican and Mexican</a> heritage, grew up in a neighborhood at the top of Manhattan, surrounded by the Latino community he extols in his Tony award-winning musical <i>In the Heights</i>. But he went to school on the snootier, more white Upper East side, which was a tremendous adjustment. He struggled at first — math made him anxious, he disliked his nose, as Pollack-Pelzner writes — but, like a lot of people who feel like they don't fit in, he gravitated toward theater.</p><p>Theater gave Miranda a place to try out his ideas, and he reached out to talented people he knew to help get them up on stage. Pollack-Pelzner writes that Miranda collects people who can teach him something, keeping many of them as lifelong collaborators: one particular friend taught him a bit about composing music; others helped him learn to freestyle. When he was hired to translate some lyrics in <i>West Side Story</i> into Spanish for a new Broadway production, he met the late composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim — and Sondheim became a mentor, helping him navigate the world of musical theater.</p><p>His family has also been a strong source of support. His mother Luz Towns-Miranda, a therapist, helped him process the big feelings that he'd later turn into songs, Pollack-Pelzner explains. His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr., a political strategist, helped him with everything from Puerto Rican slang to financial support for his productions. Miranda's wife, Vanessa Nadal, has also contributed to his successes — she prodded him to include a song for the women in <i>Hamilton</i>, which became \"The Schuyler Sisters.\"</p><p>Miranda regularly publicly thanks and praises those who have supported and taught him, and who have contributed their ideas and talents to his work. That they feel validated by him is evident from the many thoughtful, warm quotes in the book. Pollack-Pelzner says he interviewed more than 150 people and met with Miranda himself more than a dozen times. Miranda shared with him \"early scripts, rough recordings, and grainy videos of sixth-grade musicals, high school one-acts, college projects and pre-Broadway experiments,\" he writes.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner is at his strongest when he delves into the fascinating nitty gritty of the collaborations that help productions come together. People call Miranda a genius because he seamlessly mashes seemingly disparate ideas together (the American Revolution and hip-hop!) to make work that is sparkling with joy, emotionally resonant and blazingly new. And Pollack-Pelzner brings us so deeply into this work — tracing the birth of individual songs line by line — that we feel the zing of creation.</p><p>But this is not a hagiography. Pollack-Pelzner is frank about Miranda's shortcomings, such as the time when the original cast of <i>Hamilton</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/theater/hamilton-producers-and-actors-reach-deal-on-sharing-profits.html\">was fighting to share 1% of the profits</a> for the show's runaway success. Like many original casts, they had helped foster its development. Miranda — who was both a cast member who received a pay check and a creator who received royalties — tried to stay out of it, instead of advocating for them with the lead producer, and he felt \"othered\" by the cast, Pollack-Pelzner explains.</p><p>The book also wades into the murk around Miranda's attempt to influence politics.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2018/06/08/lin-manuel-miranda-amplifies-puerto-rico-fundraising-efforts-with-google-org-2m-matching-grant/\">Miranda raised millions of dollars for relief </a>after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017; he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lin-manuel-miranda-s-hamilton-funds-give-puerto-rican-art-n1040891\">wanted to raise more by bringing  Hamilton</a> to the University of Puerto Rico, his father's alma mater. But in 2016, he had asked Congress in an op-ed to support a bill that would restructure the territory's significant debt. The University of Puerto Rico had been particularly negatively affected — budgets were cut, employees threatened to strike and students protested.</p><p>\"Boy, is <i>Hamilton</i> a bad fit for raising money for Puerto Rico,\" Miranda is quoted as saying in the book. \"It's singing about the financial system that traps Puerto Rico in debt.\"</p><p>The show had to be moved to a different venue and Miranda wound up swearing off politics.</p><h4>Performing Arts</h4><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h2><h4>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h4><p>And yet, it was still a homecoming. When he sang, \"My name is Alexander Hamilton,\" the book recounts, \"Two thousand people rose in a standing ovation that seemed like it would last forever. 'It was the first time I <i>felt</i> a cheer,' he said after the show. 'I felt my hair move.'\"</p><p>But of course, he didn't keep all the praise for himself — at the end of the show, he brought his father onstage to thank him.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner uses these details to treat Miranda as the creator he is — enthusiastic, vulnerable, ambitious, innovative, fallible — instead of as a mere celebrity. A different biographer might have used this as an occasion for dishy name dropping, but Pollack-Pelzner builds the case that Miranda is so successful because he is able to take all the contradictions of who he is, what he's experienced, who he knows, and combine them into work that speaks to so many. And it could be that this talent is, in fact, genius.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5532081/lin-manuel-miranda-biography-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The report was titled—you guessed it—<i>Make Our Children Healthy Again</i>.</p>\n<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who leads the Department of Health and Human Services, and his colleagues are focusing on four key aspects of child health: diet, exercise, chemical exposure, and overmedicalization.</p>\n<p>Anyone who’s been listening to RFK Jr. posturing on health and wellness won’t be surprised by these priorities. And the first two are pretty obvious. On the whole, American children<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/29/1122733/rfk-jrs-plan-to-improve-americas-diet-is-missing-the-point/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=*%7Cdate:m-d-y%7C*\"> should be eating more healthily</a>. And they should be getting more exercise.</p>\n<p>But there’s a glaring omission. The leading cause of death for American children and teenagers isn’t ultraprocessed food or exposure to some chemical.<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/firearm-violence/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#cdcreference_1\"> It’s gun violence</a>. </p>\n<p>Yesterday’s news of yet more high-profile shootings at schools in the US throws this disconnect into even sharper relief. Experts believe it is time to treat gun violence in the US as what it is: a public health crisis.</p>\n<p>I live in London, UK, with my husband and two young children. We don’t live in a particularly fancy part of the city—in<a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/news/every-london-borough-ranked-from-poshest-to-least-posh-041725\"> one recent ranking of London boroughs from most to least posh</a>, ours came in at 30th out of 33. I do worry about crime. But I don’t worry about gun violence.</p>\n<p>That changed when I temporarily moved my family to the US a couple of years ago. We rented the ground-floor apartment of a lovely home in Cambridge, Massachusetts—a beautiful area with good schools, pastel-colored houses, and fluffy rabbits hopping about. It wasn’t until after we’d moved in that my landlord told me he had guns in the basement.</p>\n<p>My daughter joined the kindergarten of a local school that specialized in music, and we took her younger sister along to watch the kids sing songs about friendship. It was all so heartwarming—until we noticed the school security officer at the entrance carrying a gun.</p>\n<p>Later in the year, I received an email alert from the superintendent of the Cambridge Public Schools. “At approximately 1:45 this afternoon, a Cambridge Police Department Youth Officer assigned to Cambridge Rindge and Latin School accidentally discharged their firearm while using a staff bathroom inside the school,” the message began. “The school day was not disrupted.”</p>\n<p>These experiences, among others, truly brought home to me the cultural differences over firearms between the US and the UK (along with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/world/us-gun-culture-world-comparison-intl-cmd\">most other countries</a>). For the first time, I worried about my children’s exposure to them. I banned my children from accessing parts of the house. I felt guilty that my four-year-old had to learn what to do if a gunman entered her school. </p>\n<p>But it’s the statistics that are the most upsetting.</p>\n<p>In 2023, 46,728 people died from gun violence in the US, according to<a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-gun-violence-solutions/annual-gun-violence-data\"> a report</a> published in June by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That includes both homicides and suicides, and it breaks down to 128 deaths <i>per day</i>, on average. The majority of those who die from gun violence are adults. But the figures for children are sickening, too. In 2023, 2,566 young people died from gun violence. Of those, 234 were under the age of 10.</p>\n<p>Gun death rates among children have<a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens\"> more than doubled since 2013</a>. Firearms are involved in more child deaths than cancer or car crashes.</p>\n<p>Many other children <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10249597/\">survive gun violence with nonfatal—but often life-changing—injuries</a>. And the impacts are felt beyond those who are physically injured. Witnessing gun violence or hearing gunshots can understandably<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31179801/\"> cause fear, sadness, and distress</a>.  </p>\n<p>That’s worth bearing in mind when you consider that there have been 434 school shootings in the US since Columbine in 1999. The <i>Washington Post</i> estimates that<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/\"> 397,000 students have experienced gun violence at school in that period</a>. Another school shooting took <a href=\"https://www.cpr.org/2025/09/10/evergreen-high-school-shooting/\">place at Evergreen High School </a>in Colorado on Wednesday, adding to that total.</p>\n<p>“Being indirectly exposed to gun violence takes its toll on our mental health and children’s ability to learn,” says Daniel Webster, Bloomberg Professor of American Health at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>The MAHA<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf\"> report</a> states that “American youth face a mental health crisis,” going on to note that “suicide deaths among 10- to 24-year-olds increased by 62% from 2007 to 2021” and that “suicide is now the leading cause of death in teens aged 15-19.” What it doesn’t say is that<a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/sites/default/files/2025-06/2023-cgvs-gun-violence-in-the-united-states.pdf\"> around half of these suicides involve guns</a>.</p>\n<p>“When you add all these dimensions, [gun violence is] a very huge public health problem,” says Webster.</p>\n<p>Researchers who study gun violence have been saying the same thing for years. And in 2024, then US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared it a public health crisis. “We don’t have to subject our children to the ongoing horror of firearm violence in America,” Murthy<a href=\"https://us.pagefreezer.com/en-US/wa/browse/0a7f82bb-be6e-448a-ae11-373d22c37842?find-by-timestamp=2025-01-02T05:49:59Z&amp;url=https:%2F%2Fwww.hhs.gov%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2024%2F06%2F25%2Fus-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-public-health-crisis-firearm-violence-united-states.html&amp;timestamp=2025-01-02T07:03:02Z\"> said in a statement at the time</a>.

    "body": "<p>Apple launched a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro/\">slate of new iPhones</a> on Tuesday loaded with the company's new A19 and A19 Pro chips. Along with an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/exciting-camera-features-on-apples-new-iphone-17-lineup/\">ultrathin iPhone Air and other redesigns</a>, the new phones come with a less flashy upgrade that could turn out to be the true killer feature. A security improvement called Memory Integrity Enforcement combines always-on, chip-level protections with software defenses in an effort to harden iPhones against the most common—and commonly exploited—software vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>In recent years, a movement has been steadily growing across the global tech industry to address a ubiquitous and insidious type of bugs known as memory-safety vulnerabilities. A computer's memory is a shared resource among all programs, and memory safety issues crop up when software can pull data that should be off limits from a computer's memory or manipulate data in memory that shouldn't be accessible to the program. When developers—even experienced and security-conscious developers—write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it's easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities. That's why proactive tools like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/rust-secure-programming-language-memory-safe/\">special programming languages</a> have been proliferating with the goal of making it structurally impossible for software to contain these vulnerabilities, rather than attempting to avoid introducing them or catch all of them.</p>\n<p>“The importance of memory safety cannot be overstated,” the US National Security Agency and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/23/2003742198/-1/-1/0/CSI_MEMORY_SAFE_LANGUAGES_REDUCING_VULNERABILITIES_IN_MODERN_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT.PDF\">wrote in a June report</a>. “The consequences of memory safety vulnerabilities can be severe, ranging from data breaches to system crashes and operational disruptions.”</p>\n<p>Apple's Swift programming language, released in 2014, is memory-safe. The company says it has been writing new code in Swift for years as well as attempting to strategically overhaul and rewrite existing code in the memory-safe language to make its systems more secure. This reflects the challenge of memory safety across the industry, because even if new code is written more securely, the world's software was all written in memory-unsafe languages for decades. And while, in general, Apple's locked down ecosystem has so far succeeded at preventing widespread malware attacks against iPhones, motivated attackers, particularly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-spyware-investment/\">spyware makers</a>, do still develop complex iOS exploit chains at high cost to target specific victims' iPhones.</p>\n<p>Even with the work Apple has done to begin overhauling its code for memory safety, the company has found that these rarefied attack chains virtually always still include exploitation of memory bugs.</p>\n<p>“Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry,” Apple wrote in its <a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/\">Memory Integrity Enforcement announcement</a> on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Apple has increasingly invested in memory safety with Swift and secure memory allocators that manage which regions of memory are “allocated” and “deallocated” for which data—a major factor in, and source of, memory safety vulnerabilities. But Memory Integrity Enforcement itself was originally inspired by work at the hardware level to protect code integrity even when a system has suffered memory corruption.</p>\n<p>With memory-unsafe programming languages underlying so much of the world's collective code base, Apple's Security Engineering and Architecture team felt that putting memory safety mechanisms at the heart of Apple's chips could be a deus ex machina for a seemingly intractable problem. The group built on a specification known as <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf\">Memory Tagging Extension</a> (MTE) released in 2019 by the chipmaker Arm. The idea was to essentially password protect every memory allocation in hardware so that future requests to access that region of memory are only granted by the system if the request includes the right secret.</p>\n<p>Arm developed MTE as a tool to help developers find and fix memory corruption bugs. If the system receives a memory access request without passing the secret check, the app will crash and the system will log the sequence of events for developers to review. Apple's engineers wondered whether MTE could run all the time rather than just being used as a debugging tool, and the group worked with Arm to release a version of the specification for this purpose in 2022 called <a href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/0100/Feature-descriptions/The-Armv8-9-architecture-extension?lang=en#md454-the-armv89-architecture-extension__FEAT_MTE4\">Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension</a>.</p>\n<p>To make all of this a constant, real-time defense against exploitation of memory safety vulnerabilities, Apple spent years architecting the protection deeply within its chips so the feature could be on all the time for users without sacrificing overall processor and memory performance. In other words, you can see how generating and attaching secrets to every memory allocation and then demanding that programs manage and produce these secrets for every memory request could dent performance. But Apple says that it has been able to thread the needle.</p>\n<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement “is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 and iPhone Air</a> and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect,” Apple wrote in the announcement.</p>\n<p>The company also <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging\">released a version</a> of the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension specification for all Apple developers in Xcode so app makers can start to incorporate the protection into their products. Researchers who participate in Apple's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hackable-iphone-research/\">special device program</a> will also be encouraged to test and attack Memory Integrity Enforcement in the new version of the devices that contain A19 series chips.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-memory-integrity-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/geedge-networks-mass-censorship-leak/\">trove of internal documents</a> leaked from a little-known Chinese company has pulled back the curtain on how digital censorship tools are being marketed and exported globally. Geedge Networks sells what amounts to a commercialized “Great Firewall” to at least four countries, including Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Myanmar. The groundbreaking leak shows in granular detail the capabilities this company has to monitor, intercept, and hack internet traffic. Researchers who examined the files described it as “digital authoritarianism as a service.”</p>\n<p>But I want to focus on another thing the documents demonstrate: While people often look at China’s Great Firewall as a single, all-powerful government system unique to China, the actual process of developing and maintaining it works the same way as surveillance technology in the West. Geedge collaborates with academic institutions on research and development, adapts its business strategy to fit different clients’ needs, and even repurposes leftover infrastructure from its competitors. In Pakistan, for example, Geedge landed a contract to work with and later replace gear made by the Canadian company Sandvine, the leaked files show.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, another leak from a different Chinese company published this week reinforces the same point. On Monday, researchers at Vanderbilt University made public <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/national-security/wicked-problems-lab/golaxy/\">a 399-page document</a> from GoLaxy, a Chinese company that uses AI to analyze social media and generate propaganda materials. The leaked documents, which include internal pitch decks, business goals, and meeting notes, may have come from a disgruntled former employee—the last two pages accuse GoLaxy of mistreating workers by underpaying them and mandating long hours. The document had been sitting on the open internet for months before another researcher flagged it to Brett Goldstein, a research professor in the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt.</p>\n<p>GoLaxy’s main business is different from Geedge’s: It collects open source information from social media, maps relationships among political figures and news organizations, and pushes targeted narratives online through synthetic social media profiles. In the leaked document, GoLaxy claims to be the “number one brand in intelligence big data analysis” in China, servicing three main customers: the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese military. The included technology demos focus heavily on geopolitical issues like Taiwan, Hong Kong, and US elections. And unlike Geedge, GoLaxy seems to be targeting only domestic government entities as clients.</p>\n<p>But there are also quite a few things that make the two companies comparable, particularly in terms of how their businesses function. Both Geedge and GoLaxy maintain close relationships with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the top government-affiliated research institution in the world, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nature-index/\">the Nature Index</a>. And they both market their services to Chinese provincial-level government agencies, who have localized issues they want to monitor and budgets to spend on surveillance and propaganda tools.</p>\n<p>GoLaxy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. In a previous <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/us/politics/china-artificial-intelligence-information-warfare.html\">response</a> to The New York Times, the company denied collecting data targeting US officials and called the outlet’s reporting misinformation. Vanderbilt researchers say they witnessed the company remove pages from its website after the initial reporting.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Closer Than They Seem</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>In the West, when academic scholars see opportunities to commercialize their cutting-edge research, they often become startup founders or start side businesses. GoLaxy seems to be no exception. Many key researchers at the company, according to the leaked document, still occupy spots at CAS.</p>\n<p>But there’s no guarantee that CAS researchers will get government grants—just like a public university professor in the US can’t bet on their startup winning federal contracts. Instead, they need to go after government agencies like any private company would go after clients. One document in the leak shows that GoLaxy assigned sales targets to five employees and was aiming to secure 42 million RMB (about $5.9 million) in contracts with Chinese government agencies in 2020. Another spreadsheet from around 2021 lists the company’s current clients, which include branches of the Chinese military, state security, and provincial police departments, as well as other potential customers it was targeting.</p>\n<p>Together, these two leaks show how the surveillance and propaganda industry in China is driven as much by economic forces as political ideology. “This echoes what I saw in researching emotion recognition AI and other surveillance tech, whose sales often appeared to be more motivated by market logic than by a grand plan to make the world more authoritarian,” says Shazeda Ahmed, a DataX postdoctoral scholar at UCLA.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>A Striking Detail</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The parallels with the West are hard to miss. A number of American surveillance and propaganda firms also started as academic projects before they were spun out into startups and grew by chasing government contracts. The difference is that in China, these companies operate with far less transparency. Their work comes to light only when a trove of documents slips onto the internet.</p>\n<p>One of the aha moments I had reading the GoLaxy leak was when it explained the importance of its work by comparing it to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-facebook-privacy-awakening/\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, a political consulting firm that harvested Facebook data from millions of users to target ads and influence elections.</p>\n<p>“Internationally, besides helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election, the British company Cambridge Analytica had actually participated in more than 40 American political campaigns, and played an important behind-the-scenes role in events such as Ukraine’s Orange Revolution and the Brexit movement in the UK,” the document boasted.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/made-in-china-how-chinas-surveillance-industry-actually-works/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Brittany Andrews, a cheerful American porn star, cuts to the chase in her workshop on how to succeed in the adult industry.</p>\n<p>“Do you think about how much money you’re going to make before you make a clip? Do you know what stuff sells the best? Or do you just follow your creative spark?” she asks. She points to a young Ukrainian model in a gold sequined bra and denim shorts. “I’m starting with you, girlfriend!”</p>\n<p>“We’re all here to earn money. That’s normal,” the model replies. Her main advice, she adds, is to be super organised about uploading content regularly, to prevent subscribers drifting away. “What matters is consistency. There are so many beautiful, amazing models … if you for a moment stop posting, people will forget you pretty fast.”</p>\n<p>In a modern riverside hotel in central Amsterdam, about 1,000 adult content creators gathered last Tuesday for the biggest pornography conference in Europe. They had travelled from all corners of the continent for an event designed to help them navigate the industry’s high-pressure gig economy and maximise profits.</p>\n<p>A group of elderly Americans, waiting in the lobby for a windmills and Edam tour, watched them arrive with flustered bemusement. Most creators – the euphemistic term for people who record and upload explicit content to sites such as OnlyFans – were dressed down, makeup-free in jeans and trainers. But some came in nine-inch diamante heels, or on pink roller skates with flashing wheels, or with their hair tied in bunches, wearing the Hello Kitty backpacks more usually favoured by preteens.</p>\n<p>The annual Xbiz conference lasts three days. It brings creators (primarily but not exclusively women) together with executives (primarily but not exclusively men), as well as model management agencies, online payment and traffic optimisation companies, and content-sharing platforms. There are panel sessions and workshops where creators are given advice on trends in the industry, algorithms and changes in government regulations.</p>\n<p>It kicks off with an invitation to down shots at a bar in the city’s red-light district to “discover the joys of day drinking”. The first full day begins with a speed-dating session at which creators can meet and organise “collabs” – recording explicit content together, so they reach each other’s followers and attract new paying fans of their own. Between panel sessions, some pairs retreat to rooms upstairs to film themselves having sex.</p>\n<p>Guest speakers analyse why tentacles and aliens are so in vogue in porn, promise to explain how “independent creators can make millions” and give tips on how to use “charm, empathy and emotional intelligence” to “attract loyal fans and build lasting audience connections”.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere is exuberant. The sector is, after all, booming. But there is an undercurrent of anxiety about four looming challenges: the arrival of artificial intelligence; how to make money in a saturated market; the spread of age verification rules; and the very real risk of burnout for creators.</p>\n<p>In the queue for the coffee machine on Wednesday morning, James, a computer programmer from Singapore, talks excitedly about his new AI company. He promises this will make models’ lives easier, by reducing the exhaustion and pressure inherent in producing a constant stream of pornography. (He is not keen to share his surname.)</p>\n<p>“It’s really about helping stars avoid burnout,” he says, explaining his plans to license images of well-established performers. Their AI avatars will then be able to perform sex on demand, all day, all night, for an unlimited number of viewers.</p>\n<p>“Do you mind if I show you something? It’s quite explicit.” Without waiting for my reply, he plays a video on his phone of a couple having sex. The man has his hand around the woman’s neck, throttling her. It looks like it would be hard for her to breathe, if she were actually human.</p>\n<p>“You wouldn’t know it was AI!” he says, swiping left for more choking content. “It looks so real.” (The British government this year committed to banning pornographic content that depicts strangulation; it is not yet clear if the ban will stretch to AI-generated content.)</p>\n<p>He speaks with the self-congratulation of a 1950s salesman presenting housewives with new labour-saving washing machines. “Fans want customised content. If you want to see her in ripped lingerie having doggy sex in a cave, the creators don’t have time to film that, so we leverage AI to help them. We want to help creators unlock productivity and let them earn as much as they can,” he says, apparently unaware of how weird it is for men who are hoping to get rich from pornography to pretend they are nobly doing women a favour.</p>\n<p>A little later, British creator Lily Phillips arrives in the lobby. She became famous last year after filming herself having sex with 100 men in a day. “I’m just here for a good time!” she says, determinedly upbeat, dressed down in a cream tracksuit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/11/boom-times-and-total-burnout-three-days-at-europes-biggest-pornography-conference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A grey-haired man with black glasses is walking, wearing a white shirt and navy suit jacket. He has a neutral expression on his face.\"/>\n    <p>This time last week, there was a drip, drip of revelations about the then-deputy prime minister and calls for her resignation.</p>\n    <p>Fast forward seven days, and there is a drip, drip of revelations about the UK's ambassador to the United States and calls for his resignation.</p>\n    <p>A cabinet minister's jaw drops when I tell them about the story.</p>\n    <p>For those who have kicked around at Westminster for a while, there is something familiar about it too.</p>\n    <p>Peter Mandelson twice lost his job in the cabinet two decades ago over his dealings with rich men.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, in 1998, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/241464.stm\">he resigned as Trade and Industry Secretary</a> after a row about borrowing a third of a million pounds from a ministerial colleague. </p>\n    <p>In 2001<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy9dwe50leo\"> he resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary</a> after a row about a passport application from an Indian billionaire. </p>\n    <p>Now he is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy9jqn0vyjo\">deeply embroiled in a row involving a third rich man</a>, the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson's friendship with the late Epstein has long been publicly known, so the key political questions are actually for the prime minister, in choosing to appoint him.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street is not currently providing straight answers when we ask whether these most recent revelations are a surprise to them and whether they know what may be still to come.</p>\n    <p>They insist \"due process\" was followed before <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvnlxxp8jko\">Lord Mandelson's appointment.</a></p>\n    <p>It would appear that either Downing Street was insufficiently curious or sceptical about the extent of Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before giving him the job, or calculated that he would be so good in the role it would be worth soaking up any embarrassment the connection might cause them.</p>\n    <p>Or perhaps they hoped the embarrassing stuff would never come out.</p>\n    <p>The ambassador's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yevwvvneyo\">on camera interview with the Sun included one moment which really stood out</a> - his acknowledgement there would be more revelations to come.</p>\n    <p>I have since been told that on Monday, before his interview with The Sun, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-jeffrey-epstein-emails-peter-mandelson/?srnd=homepage-uk&amp;embedded-checkout=true\">Bloomberg approached Lord Mandelson to offer him the chance to comment</a> on over 100 emails they say they had obtained, between him and Epstein, sent between 2005 and 2010.</p>\n    <p>The one that stands out is the one also reported by the Sun. It was sent by Mandelson to Epstein in 2008, as the financier prepared to be jailed for soliciting prostitution from someone aged under 18.</p>\n    <p>\"Fight for early release,\" Lord Mandelson is quoted as writing, adding \"your friends stay with you and love you\".</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson doesn't deny these emails.</p>\n    <p>In a statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of his innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\"</p>\n    <p>We have asked him to respond to Bloomberg's revelations.</p>\n    <p>At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked Sir Keir about Lord Mandelson and whether it was \"tenable\" for him to remain as ambassador.</p>\n    <p>Among Labour MPs, there is exasperation.</p>\n    <p>\"I am angry about Keir defending Mandelson today. Mandelson has to go, and it really questions Keir's judgement in my eyes,\" one texts.</p>\n    <p>Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is running for the deputy leadership of Labour, has publicly called for Lord Mandelson to resign, as has the former shadow cabinet minister Andy McDonald.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives have tabled a slew of parliamentary questions to try to tease out further details about what was known by who and when.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street insists it has full confidence in Lord Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>But this isn't going away.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36k0k8kkpwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The document revealed that Russia had launched two cyber attacks prior to the election, one against a company that sold software related to voter registration, and another against 122 local election officials. </p>\n    <p>The contractor, an Air Force veteran named <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/06/531722218/what-we-know-about-reality-winner-government-contractor-accused-of-nsa-leak\">Reality Winner</a>, sent the document to <i>The Intercept, </i>a journalism site specializing in reporting leaks. But Winner admits now that she made a crucial miscalculation.</p>\n    <p>\"What I had assumed was they would receive it [and] immediately assume that this was something that was important, that it answered very important questions that the country was having, that it would be protected,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>That's not what happened. Instead, in the process of fact-checking the document, the reporters assigned to the story sent the document to the FBI, which sent it to the NSA. The security agency easily identified Winner, a crypto linguist, as the source of the leak.</p>\n    <p>Looking back now, Winner says her timing could not have been worse; the Trump administration had been combatting a string of leaks. FBI director <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/17/602849276/james-comey-to-fresh-air-the-fbi-isnt-on-anybodys-side\">James Comey</a> and the president \"were both saying that they were going to nail the next leaker to the wall,\" she says. \"And then I just happened to be the very next name popping up.\"</p>\n    <p>Winner was tried under the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/28/534682231/once-reserved-for-spies-espionage-act-now-used-against-suspected-leakers\">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and received the longest sentence to that point for leaking classified information to a media outlet. She accepted a plea deal, lowering her sentence of 10 years to five. She was released from prison in 2021.</p>\n    <p>Winner's story has been told in a 2021 documentary <i>Reality Winner</i>, the 2023 film <i>Reality, </i>and in<i> </i>the play <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1044602235/is-this-a-room-reality-winner-play\"> Is This A Room</a>, in which actors reenacted the transcript of the FBI interrogation of her. Now, she's looking back in a memoir titled</p>\n    <p><i>I Am Not Your Enemy.</i>It's not a tell-all, she says, because she's still bound by the non-disclosure agreement she signed with the NSA.</p>\n    <p>\"I am under a lasting ... non-disclosure agreement to never talk about anything that could be related to classified information from my Air Force career as a linguist, and then, moving forward, anything that I had done as an NSA contractor, and furthermore, anything within the four corners of the document that I leaked,\" she says.</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/994x1500+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2Fd3%2Fd5218f2c49f7a722cdad2adfc1e9%2F71vkiu11jhl-sl1500.jpg\" alt=\"71VKiU11JHL._SL1500_.jpg\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what it was like in the Georgia county jail </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The conditions of that county jail in Lincoln County, Ga. were abhorrent. ... I had been sheltered and privileged and naïve before that. I did not ever imagine that conditions like that would be considered normal or even good for any American in custody. And I was assured several times over that I was being treated the best and that was the most comfortable county jail in the area.</p>\n    <p>I was given this plastic mat with this crumpled plastic wool falling out of it [to sleep on]. It was held together with duct tape. That was my mat. … There was one sink, a picnic table that was covered in rust in the center of the room, a toilet that was about three feet away from that picnic table that we were supposed to sit and eat at, and a shower directly by the toilet with a black mold-crusted shower curtain over it. There was something so dystopian about it. … The toilet had a brown bedsheet draped over it so that you didn't have to eat at the table and make eye contact with somebody using the toilet.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On being transferred to a federal prison in Carswell, Texas</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>My first week there, I felt like I was at Harvard. I couldn't believe how big the compound was. It was two buildings and a very small rec center with a concrete track. <strong>… </strong>My sensory deprivation of 15, 16 months only existing in one room [in the Georgia county jail], I just remembered walking around Carswell and thinking, I'm going to get lost here every single day. It's just so big.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiencing COVID-19 restrictions in prison</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We were confined to our cells, which did not have restrooms. So we had to ask 24-7, seven days a week, to go use the restroom from another adult. We were no longer allowed to go outside and our movements were controlled around the unit. We couldn't just shower when we wanted to shower or go use their phones. As they eased up, we were still not allowed outside of the unit. …</p>\n    <p>The positive mail kept me going. I also had a network where I could just ask for any book I wanted and it would show up. So in addition to getting every single book I heard you talk about on <i>Fresh Air</i> for four years, I was basically the library for everybody in the unit. They would give me their requests and people's books would show up.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling after her release, especially with darkness</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the first time in four years, I had actually seen what a dark room looked like. … I had never been alone in a room before, with the exception of solitary confinement, but that wasn't really alone. So I was just so terrified all the time. I could not feel at ease in any way, shape or form. I never expected that would be something that I would feel. … Nobody tells you that once you get out of prison life just gets harder.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On conflict with her mother after her release</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The biggest point of contention between my mother and I was the status of my notoriety and the fact that she had been out for four years doing interviews about me and ... that she felt obligated to tell her Twitter following updates about me while the halfway house was saying, \"If your presence is detected on social media, or if we feel like you're communicating on social in any way, or that we feel you're in danger, we will take you back into custody.\" And my mother had wanted to tweet that I was home. And I said that they would take me back into custody if people knew I was at that home address. And she said that she wanted to be truthful to her following. And I just felt so offended, like the only reason why you had that following was to support me and I'm sitting right here in front of you and you care more about them than me. … I felt like while I was at my most vulnerable, she was still processing things through being interviewed about me instead of being my mom. And, you know, our relationship is still on the mend.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what she's doing now</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I'm a level two CrossFit coach and I am currently going to Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville in the veterinary technology program. … We did have to send attorneys for permission to at least take the state licensing test so that I could help my school out with passing rates, but [as a convicted felon] I will never be a licensed vet tech.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"</p>\n    <p>And yet the calculation Sir Keir made, alongside his top foreign affairs adviser Jonathan Powell and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, was that Lord Mandelson's talents outweighed the risks.</p>\n    <p>Allies of the outgoing ambassador still suggest it was probably the right decision considering what the PM knew last autumn.</p>\n    <p>\"If you look at his success in the role, the reasons for appointing him were vindicated,\" said a friend of the peer. \"He's been good on trade and built a strong relationship with the White House. He's been exemplary.\"</p>\n    <p>Former President George W Bush nicknamed Lord Mandelson \"Silvertongue\". The peer knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, has met Elon Musk, and holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.</p>\n    <p>Part of the irony of Lord Mandelson's relationship with Epstein is that he shares that very same link with President Trump - proof of a top level if murky network among US elites.</p>\n    <p>After four decades in politics, Lord Mandelson's career in public life now seems sure to be over.</p>\n    <p>But questions about the prime minister's judgement remain.</p>\n    <p>Last autumn, Sir Keir decided that being friends with a convicted paedophile in the past should not exclude someone from high public office.</p>\n    <p>This week the volume, scale and excruciating details of the pair's contacts, plus the revelation that the peer encouraged the paedophile to challenge his conviction changed the PM's view.</p>\n    <p>Many Labour MPs think their leader should have seen this scandal a mile off.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd1egrlj0mo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Indeed, he was dubbed the Trump whisperer, and his close relationship with the White House were clear to see.</p>\n    <p>But it is due to one of his former connections that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">he has now lost</a> this plum diplomatic role.</p>\n    <p>And it is far from the first time Lord Mandelson has lost his job, in a turbulent 40-year-long career in British politics.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was born into Labour Party royalty - his grandfather was Herbert Morrison, a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee's 1945 government, revered by Labour members.</p>\n    <p>He began working for Labour in the 1980s, when the party was at its lowest ebb, suffering successive defeats to Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>The painful 1992 defeat - when Neil Kinnock's Labour were unexpectedly beaten - spurred Mandelson in his belief that the party needed to modernise if they were ever to get back into government.</p>\n    <p>In 1994, he played a pivotal role in getting Tony Blair elected as party leader - crucially backing him over Gordon Brown, who had been seen as the heir apparent.</p>\n    <p>For a long time it seemed that Brown would never forgive his former ally for this, in his eyes, betrayal.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67b9/live/2858bc60-8f13-11f0-bf0b-13ad835103b3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson\"/>\n    <p>Despite lingering tensions, the three men continued to work together and were the key architects of New Labour, the rebranding aimed at making the party electable.</p>\n    <p>In 1997 their work paid off, and following the landslide victory, Mandelson was given the job of minister without portfolio and then trade secretary.</p>\n    <p>The archetypal spin doctor, his reputation as a behind-the scenes fixer, schemer and schmoozer earned him the nickname, \"the Prince of Darkness\".</p>\n    <p>In 1998, he was forced into the first of his government resignations when it was revealed he had received a secret loan of £373,000 from his ministerial colleague Geoffrey Robinson.</p>\n    <p>Less than a year later he was back in government taking on the position of Northern Ireland secretary.</p>\n    <p>He lasted in that job until January 2001, when he quit over allegations of misconduct over a passport application for the Hinduja brothers. An inquiry later cleared him of wrongdoing.</p>\n    <p>His indignation at being booted out came boiling over later that year when he held onto his constituency seat of Hartlepool, despite challenges from left-wing candidates.</p>\n    <p>In an extraordinary and emotional victory speech, he said: \"It was said that I was facing political ruin. My career in tatters, apparently never to be part of the political living again.</p>\n    <p>\"Well, they underestimated Hartlepool. And they underestimated me. Because I am fighter and not a quitter!\"</p>\n    <p>Two years later he quit as an MP to become the EU's trade commissioner.</p>\n    <p>When Brown became prime minister in 2007, another comeback in British politics for Mandelson looked unlikely.</p>\n    <p>But in a shock move, a beleaguered Brown, suffering low polling ratings, appeared to bury the hatchet and appointed his former friend as business secretary, making him a peer at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was tasked with reinvigorating the government, which appeared to have run out of steam after a decade in power.</p>\n    <p>While many Labour backbenchers and members acknowledged Mandelson's presentational skill and strategic nous, they held him responsible for ditching some of the party's key socialist principles.</p>\n    <p>He was held in such suspicion, that Tony Blair once said the New Labour project would only be complete when party members had \"learnt to love Peter Mandelson\".</p>\n    <p>Mandelson himself said that was setting the bar too high. However, he seemed to have succeeded at the 2009 Labour Party conference when Mandelson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8279705.stm\">delivered a rousing speech</a> to despondent delegates, telling them: \"If I can come back, we can come back.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/977a/live/79e0ac10-8efe-11f0-ad1d-477615c292d0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Donald Trump shakes hands with Mandelson in the Oval Office. \"/>\n    <p>After Labour lost power, Mandelson started international lobbying firm, Global Counsel, where he was able to continue amassing influential contacts in business and politics.</p>\n    <p>These contacts, along with his ability to charm (he was nicknamed \"silver tongue\" by US President George W Bush), were among the reasons he was considered a strong candidate when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was looking for a new ambassador in Washington.</p>\n    <p>He had holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and made connections with Mark Burnett, the TV producer of the Apprentice, the show that sparked Trump's rise to power.</p>\n    <p>However, one of these connections has led to his downfall - his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, which continued after the American financier had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson had been widely-considered to have performed well in his first months as ambassador, but following the public release of his embarrassing correspondence with Epstein - and the threat of more to come - No 10 has decided to jettison him.</p>\n    <p>Throughout his career, Mandelson's ability to hob-nob with the rich and powerful has been an asset but has repeatedly got him into trouble.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, a friend of Mandelson told the BBC: \"He has weaknesses.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Early Wednesday morning, Poland shot down several <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-drones-russia-ukraine/\">Russian drones</a> that had violated its airspace during a massive strike against western <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ukraine/\">Ukraine</a>. The Polish military operation, confirmed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk through a social media message in the early morning hours, marks a turning point in Warsaw's involvement in the conflict that has affected the region for more than two and a half years. The Polish defense agency reported the presence of more than 10 objects coming from Ukrainian airspace and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/poland-engages-russian-drones-airspace-first-time-rcna230251\">called the violation</a> an “act of aggression.”</p>\n    <h2>Poland Invokes NATO Article 4</h2>\n    <p>In response to the raid, Poland activated Article 4 of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty, requesting immediate consultations with allies. Tusk urgently convened a meeting of the Council of Ministers at 8 am local time, maintaining constant contact with the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, to coordinate the political and diplomatic response.</p>\n    <p>Article 4 allows a NATO member to solicit consultations whenever it believes its security, territorial integrity, or political independence is threatened. Unlike Article 5, which provides for collective military action in the event of an armed attack, Article 4 does not compel immediate military action, but its activation nevertheless constitutes a significant political escalation, as it emphasizes the unity of the alliance in responding to perceived threats against NATO members.</p>\n    <p>Poland had already been on high alert for possible aircraft overruns since at least November 2022, when a stray Ukrainian missile accidentally hit a village in the south of the country, killing two people. Until now, however, there had been no recorded cases of Polish or allied defense systems shooting down drones on national territory. Ukrainian president <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/volodymyr-zelensky-q-and-a-ukraine-war-technology/\">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c2enwk1l9e1t?post=asset%3A89acd678-fc27-4cc6-9f0c-890375867289#post\">claimed</a> on Wednesday that “at least eight” Iranian-made Shahed drones were “aimed in the direction of Poland” during the nighttime attack, suggesting the incursion into Polish airspace was intentional.</p>\n    <h2>NATO Defense Activated</h2>\n    <p>Residents of the affected Polish areas reported hearing explosions in the sky during the night, followed by the activation of warning sirens. The alert was triggered precisely during a large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine's western regions, particularly those in Volyn and Lviv that directly border Poland.</p>\n    <p>According to information released by the Polish military command, national and NATO air defense systems were activated immediately after radar detected the entry of unmanned aircraft into Polish airspace. The interception operation continued for several hours, with the armed forces neutralizing objects deemed dangerous using air defense systems. The search for the wreckage of the downed drones is still ongoing in the eastern parts of the country as of midday Wednesday.</p>\n    <h2>Airports Temporarily Closed</h2>\n    <p>The intervention led to the temporary closure of four airports, including Warsaw-Chopin and Lublin, as well as the Rzeszów airport, which has become a crucial hub for sending Western military aid to Ukraine in the past two years. The United States Federal Aviation Administration <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/09/europe/poland-scramble-jets-russian-drone-reports-intl-hnk-ml\">confirmed</a> the temporary closure of the Polish airports for “unplanned military activity related to national security.”</p>\n    <p>The Russian drone strike also hit eastern Ukraine hard: According to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz08j8313o\">reports by the BBC</a> citing local Ukrainian officials, 24 people were killed and 19 wounded in an air raid on a village in the Donetsk region, where the victims were standing in line to collect their pensions. The incident comes amid a particularly intense phase of the conflict, where Moscow's troops are carrying out a slow but steady offensive in much of Donetsk, in western Ukraine. Meanwhile, diplomatic attempts to reach a peace agreement have essentially stalled, and contacts between Washington and Moscow in recent months have produced no concrete results.</p>\n    <h2>Rising Tensions</h2>\n    <p>The incident comes at a time of particular tension in the region. Only 24 hours before Poland shot down Russia's drones, the Polish president warned during a press conference in Helsinki that Russian president Vladimir Putin would be ready to invade other countries after the aggression against Ukraine. The timing of the incursion takes on even greater significance when one considers that on Friday, September 13, Russia and Belarus will kick off joint military exercises dubbed “Zapad,” which have already raised regional security concerns.</p>\n    <p>Poland had announced Tuesday that it was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-close-belarus-border-due-russia-led-military-exercises-pm-says-2025-09-09/\">closing its border with Belarus</a> precisely in response to what Warsaw calls “very aggressive” maneuvers, in addition to the growing number of provocations by Moscow and Minsk. Neighboring Lithuania has also decided to tighten border controls, a sign of widespread alertness among NATO member countries that border Russia and Belarus.</p>\n    <p>Wednesday's incident also comes at a delicate time for international diplomacy: US president <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/trump-says-he-is-ready-to-impose-new-sanctions-on-russia-what-does-this-mean-for-putins-war-in-ukraine\">declared</a> over the weekend that he was ready to move to a second phase of sanctions against Russia after months of unsuccessful negotiations for a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv. The downing of drones on Polish territory now risks further complicating any mediation efforts.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This story originally appeared on  WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/poland-shoots-down-russian-drones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The United States has emerged as the largest investor in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/\">commercial spyware</a>—a global industry that has enabled the covert surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, politicians, diplomats, and others, posing grave threats to human rights and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/national-security/\">national security</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2024, 20 new US-based spyware investors were identified, bringing the total number of American backers of this technology to 31. This growth has largely outpaced other major investing countries such as Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom, according to a <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/mythical-beasts-diving-into-the-depths-of-the-global-spyware-market/\">new report</a> published today by the Atlantic Council.</p>\n<p>The study <a href=\"https://staging--atlantic-council-spyware.netlify.app/\">surveyed</a> 561 entities across 46 countries between 1992 and 2024, identifying 34 new investors. This brings the total to 128, up from 94 in the <a href=\"https://mythicalbeasts.dfrlab.org/\">dataset</a> published last year.</p>\n<p>The number of identified investors in the EU Single Market, plus Switzerland, stands at 31, with Italy—a key <a href=\"https://therecord.media/how-italy-became-an-unexpected-spyware-hub\">spyware hub</a>—accounting for the largest share at 12. Investors based in Israel number 26.</p>\n<p>US-based investors <a href=\"https://staging--atlantic-council-spyware.netlify.app\">include</a> major hedge funds D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. and Millennium Management, prominent trading firm Jane Street, and mainstream financial-services company Ameriprise Financial—all of which, according to the Atlantic Council, have channeled funds to Israeli lawful-interception software provider Cognyte, a company allegedly <a href=\"https://files.nettsteder.regjeringen.no/wpuploads01/sites/275/2022/12/Rec-Cognyte-ENG.pdf\">linked</a> to human rights abuses in Azerbaijan and Indonesia, among others.</p>\n<p>Another notable example of a new US-based investment in spyware is the late-2024 acquisition of Israeli spyware vendor Paragon Solutions by AE Industrial Partners, a Florida-based, national-security-focused private equity firm. Paragon made headlines last week when its one-year contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-solutions-contract/\">first reported</a> by WIRED in October 2024—was suddenly reactivated after a lengthy pause.</p>\n<p>Civil society groups described the move by the Trump administration as “<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/eff-statement-ice-use-paragon-solutions-malware\">extremely troubling</a>” and said it “<a href=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/knight-institute-urges-congress-to-limit-ices-access-to-spyware-technologies-following-renewal-of-paragon-contract\">compounds the civil liberties concerns</a> surrounding the rapid and dramatic expansion of ICE’s budget and authority.”</p>\n<p>Paragon was linked to alleged misconduct in Europe after WhatsApp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware\">reported</a> that Italian journalists and civil society members had been targeted with its technology. An Italian parliamentary committee <a href=\"https://documenti.camera.it/_dati/leg19/lavori/documentiparlamentari/IndiceETesti/034/004/INTERO.pdf\">found</a> that the government had used its Graphite spyware to only surveil human rights defenders. However, University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/\">confirmed</a> the targeting of an Italian journalist and <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2025/03/a-first-look-at-paragons-proliferating-spyware-operations/\">identified</a> potential Paragon customers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Cyprus, Singapore, and Israel.</p>\n<p>Paragon, responding to the committee’s findings, accused Italian authorities of refusing to conduct a thorough technical verification—an assessment it argued could have resolved the issue.</p>\n<p>Apart from focusing on investment, the Atlantic Council notes that the global spyware market is “growing and evolving,” with its dataset expanded to include four new vendors, seven new resellers or brokers, 10 new suppliers, and 55 new individuals linked to the industry.</p>\n<p>Newly identified vendors include Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2021/06/02/bindecy-lays-hands-on-struggling-cyber-security-firm-merlinx,109670437-art\">Bindecy</a> and Italy’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/\">SIO</a>. Among the resellers are front companies connected to NSO products, such as Panama’s KBH and Mexico’s Comercializadora de Soluciones Integrales Mecale, as <a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/sspc/prensa/informe-de-la-secretaria-sobre-los-contratos-de-administraciones-pasadas-relacionados-con-el-software-pegasus\">highlighted</a> by the Mexican government. New suppliers named include the UK’s <a href=\"https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2025/02/19/coretech-supplies-zero-day-research-data-to-british-intelligence,110377154-art\">Coretech Security</a> and UAE’s <a href=\"https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2024/09/13/zerozenx-latest-to-join-dubai-s-buzzing-zero-day-marketplace,110285592-art\">ZeroZenX</a>.</p>\n<p>The report highlights the central role that these resellers and brokers play, stating that it is “a notably under-researched set of actors.” According to the report, “These entities act as intermediaries, obscuring the connections between vendors, suppliers, and buyers. Oftentimes, intermediaries connect vendors to new regional markets.”</p>\n<p>“This creates an expanded and opaque spyware supply chain which makes corporate structures, jurisdictional arbitrage, and ultimately accountability measures a challenge to disentangle,” Sarah Graham, who coauthored the report, tells WIRED.</p>\n<p>“Despite this, resellers and brokers are not a current feature of policy responses,” she says.</p>\n<p>The study reveals the addition of three new countries linked to spyware activity—Japan, Malaysia, and Panama. Japan in particular is a signatory to international efforts to curb spyware abuse, including the <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/joint-statement-on-efforts-to-counter-the-proliferation-and-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/\">Joint Statement</a> on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware and the Pall Mall Process <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-code-of-practice-for-states\">Code of Practice for States</a>.</p>\n<p>“The discovery of entities operating in new jurisdictions, like Japan, highlights potential conflicts of interest between international commitments and market dynamics,” Graham says.</p>\n<p>Despite efforts by the Biden administration to constrain the spyware market through its <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/30/2023-06730/prohibition-on-use-by-the-united-states-government-of-commercial-spyware-that-poses-risks-to\">executive order</a>, <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list\">trade</a> and <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/promoting-accountability-for-the-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/\">visa</a> restrictions, and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155\">sanctions</a>, the industry has continued to operate largely without restraint.</p>\n<p>“US policymakers have systematically targeted the proliferation and misuse of spyware through robust policy action, but there is a critical gap between them and US investors—where US dollars continue to fund the very entities US policymakers are trying to combat,” says Atlantic Council’s Jen Roberts, who also worked on the report.</p>\n<p>For example, spyware vendor Saito Tech (formerly Candiru), which has been on the US Commerce Department’s Entity List since 2021, <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/r1er11mi61e\">saw</a> new investment by US firm Integrity Partners in 2024. “[This] shows that signaling from the US government has not gone far enough to deter investment in this technology,” Roberts says.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is limited public awareness that some of the money spent on this controversial technology may ultimately come from ordinary citizens’ own pockets.</p>\n<p>In the case of AE Industrial Partners, investment performance reports show that the firm was backed by several US pension funds—among them the <a href=\"https://www.cccera.gov/sites/main/files/file-attachments/agenda_packet_05.22.24.pdf\">Contra Costa County Employees' Retirement Association</a>, <a href=\"https://comptroller.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09-04-AgendaWithTOC%20FINAL.pdf\">Baltimore Fire &amp; Police Retirement System</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buyoutsinsider.com/houston-firefighters-pe-allocation-swells-to-33pct/\">Houston Firefighters' Relief and Retirement Fund</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.erb.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Q3-NM-ERB-IPA-v.11-22-24.pdf\">New Mexico Educational Retirement Board</a>—providing cash that could help support the deal with Paragon, which could reach $900 million.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-spyware-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Nick Clegg chooses difficult jobs. He was the UK’s deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, a position from which he was surely pulled in multiple directions as he attempted to bridge the divide between David Cameron’s Conservatives and his own Liberal Democrats. A few years later he chose another challenging role, serving as Meta’s vice-president and then president of global affairs from 2018 until January 2025, where he was responsible for bridging the very different worlds of Silicon Valley and Washington DC (as well as other governments). How to Save the Internet is Clegg’s report on how he handled that Herculean task, along with his ideas for how to make the relationships between tech companies and regulators more cooperative and effective in the future.</p>\n<p>The main threat that Clegg addresses in the book is not one caused <i>by</i> the internet; it is the threat <i>to</i> the internet from those who would regulate it. As he puts it: “The real purpose of this book is not to defend myself or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta\">Meta</a> or big tech. It is to raise the alarm about what I believe are the truly profound stakes for the future of the internet and for who gets to benefit from these revolutionary new technologies.”</p>\n<p>But in fact, a great deal of the book is devoted to a defence of Meta and big tech, and that defence begins by conflating the internet (which is widely loved) with social media (a subset of internet activity that evokes more ambivalence). In his discussion of the “techlash” – the sharp turn in public opinion against big tech in the late 2010s – he asks: “Would we choose to turn off certain technologies if we could? Would we deny ourselves the next innovation? Would we be better off without the freedoms of the open internet?”</p>\n<p>As it happens, I recently conducted a survey with the Harris Poll that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/opinion/social-media-smartphones-harm-regret.html\">asked questions rather like these</a> to a nationally representative sample of young American adults – the very generation whose adolescence was grabbed and shaped by a few social media companies. We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, whether they wished each “was never invented”. The percentage of gen Z who regret the existence of the internet is low – 17%. For smartphones it is just 21%. But for the big social media platforms, regret is much higher, ranging from 34% for Instagram (which is owned by Meta) to 47% for TikTok and 50% for X. In our subsequent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/opinion/parents-smartphones-tiktok-facebook.html\">survey of parents</a>, levels of regret about the existence of social media are higher still. <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2023-131/\">Other researchers</a> <a href=\"https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/flrnzo5x/public-attitudes-to-smartphones-social-media-and-online-safety-1.pdf\">have made similar findings</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, yes, many of us would choose to turn off certain technologies if we could. Clegg frames the choice as a binary: open internet versus no internet. But the most serious problems are related to social media, which can be regulated without destroying “the internet”, and which is much harder to defend.</p>\n<p>Yet Clegg attempts to do so. In the first chapter he addresses the twin charges that social media has damaged global democracy and teen mental health. He acknowledges that both declined in the 2010s, but he claims that the declines merely correlate with the rise to dominance of social media, and are not caused by it. He cites academic studies, but his descriptions of them are Meta’s standard talking points, which ignore the many <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344657/\">studies</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.afterbabel.com/p/phone-based-childhood-cause-epidemic\">other side</a>. In fact, Clegg takes much of his defence word for word from <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/04/what-the-research-on-social-medias-impact-on-democracy-and-daily-life-says-and-doesnt-say/\">a rebuttal essay</a> that Meta put out in 2022 in response to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/\">one of my essays</a> laying out the case that social media is harming advanced democracies.</p>\n<p>So in this book, Clegg gives us Meta’s party line, but on teen mental health he once thought differently. Dozens of US state attorney generals are suing Meta, and the documents they have obtained show us who knew what, and when they knew it. From <a href=\"https://nmag.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-12-05-NM-v.-Meta-et-al.-COMPLAINT-REDACTED.pdf\">the brief</a> filed by the attorney general of New Mexico we learn that on 27 August 2021, Clegg forwarded an email to Mark Zuckerberg from an employee requesting more resources to address teen mental health concerns.

I mention this mistake because it testifies to something powerful about Patrick Ryan's new novel, <i>Buckeye</i>.</p><p>When I made a late request for an advance review copy of <i>Buckeye,</i> the copy I received looked fine, but when I opened it I realized it was mistakenly bound backwards. The title page was at the very end of this over-450-page novel. </p><p>So, as a kind of brain exercise, I began reading<i> Buckeye</i> backwards, my head moving from right to left. By page 9, I was already so caught up in the world Ryan creates, <i>Buckeye</i> could have been misprinted upside down and sideways and I still wouldn't have been able to put it down.</p><h4>Author Interviews</h4><h2>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h2><h4>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h4><p>As its title indicates, <i>Buckeye</i> is set in Ohio, in a fictional small town called Bonhomie. The story, which focuses on two married couples, stretches from pre-World War II to the close of the 20th century. Margaret Salt is married to Felix — a closeted gay man who kind of, maybe, harbors the unarticulated hope that marriage might render his same sex desires dormant. </p><p>When the novel opens, Margaret, who's a red-headed, green-eyed \"looker,\" walks into the town hardware store where Cal Jenkins works and demands that he turn on the radio. There's commotion on the streets outside and, especially since her husband, Felix, is serving in the Navy, Margaret wants to know what's happening. It turns out that Germany has just surrendered to the Allies. Hearing the news, Margaret grabs Cal by his shoulders and kisses him. And Cal — a good husband and new father — likes it.</p><p>From that impulsive moment all sorts of complications and secrets sprout. While this teaser of a plot summary may make <i>Buckeye</i> seem like the stuff of vintage soap operas, the atmosphere of this novel is wry and contemplative rather than melodramatic. Ryan — whose previous books include the standout 2016 short story collection, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/485842485/the-dream-life-of-astronauts-is-a-journey-to-emotional-deep-space\"> The Dream Life of Astronauts</a>, as well as three YA novels — ambitiously aims here to write an American epic and he has the chops to do so. Ryan's omniscient narrator takes turns experiencing events from the four main characters' points of view, always subtly underscoring how contingency shapes our lives.</p><p>Cal, for instance, was born with one leg two inches shorter than the other — two inches that would keep him out of World War II and put him in Margaret's path. Cal's wife, Becky, discovered in childhood that she has the ability to communicate with the dead — a gift that will prove to be a grim comfort during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Chapters roam fluidly here from flashbacks to Margaret's tough start in life in an orphanage to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/01/14/462923148/herman-wouk-says-hes-a-happy-gent-at-100\">Herman Wouk</a>-like section chronicling the torpedoing of that cargo ship Felix is serving on. Felix meets the love of his life on that ship, a fellow sailor who quotes St. Thomas Aquinas to him, saying: \"The things that we love tell us what we are.\" The decades-long aftermath of silent grief that Felix must endure after the loss of that relationship is the anguished emotional core of this novel.</p><p>What Ryan captures in <i>Buckeye</i> is both the sweep of history and the mostly mundane particularity of everyday life. If there's a flaw to find in this overwhelming novel it may be that the characters are a bit too uniformly eloquent and self-aware. But, really, why complain about too many epiphanies when they're expressed as beautifully as this? I leave you with our narrator describing Felix in old age realizing something about time:</p><blockquote><p>What is it about time that confounds us? We spend it. We save it. We while it away. We waste it. We kill it. ... We regret what we’ve done with it. We give it away. We want it back. ... Felix saw it so clearly: all we should ever want of time is more of it. Life was so simple when it was reduced to the barest of necessities: more time; more air; more Duke Ellington.</p></blockquote></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5535609/buckeye-patrick-ryan-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For example, he looked for ways to spend his allowance.</p>\n    <p>\"He was kind of a loner, but not in a bad way or a sad way,\" said Bonomo, an English professor at Northern Illinois University. \"He would go to this little dime store and this little fish store.

And so that was probably an extra factor in my being drawn to this book,\" he said.</p>\n    <h3>Henry Huggins' moral dilemma</h3>\n    <p>For Dirda, the ending of the book was a revelation.</p>\n    <p>In the last chapter of the first<i> Henry Huggins</i> (spoiler alert if you haven't read it!), an older boy comes looking for Henry after seeing a picture of him and Ribsy in the local paper. When he sees the dog, he shouts \"Dizzy!\" The dog jumps up on the boy, licks his hands and wags his tail.</p>\n    <p>Cleary writes: \"A terrible thought came to Henry. Ribsy must have belonged to the boy before he found him in the drugstore over a year ago.\"</p>\n    <p>Both boys claim ownership of the dog and tell of how much they care for him. The kids decide to have a contest to let Ribsy choose who gets to keep him.</p>\n    <p>Each boy stands \"twenty squares down the sidewalk in opposite directions\" of the dog. On \"Go,\" the older boy yells \"Here Dizzy!\" while Henry yells \"Here Ribsy!\" The tension builds as Ribsy seems torn, wagging his tail when he looks back and forth at both boys. Ultimately, he walks toward Henry.</p>\n    <p>\"I was glad Henry got to keep his dog,\" Dirda remembers. \"But then I thought, 'The other guy, he loved the dog, too. And is it right that Henry should take his dog?'\"</p>\n    <p>Dirda has written about how Henry Huggins was the first book that forced him to confront a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-henry-huggins-and-lolita-can-teach-us-about-tolerance--and-civil-discourse/2019/12/30/b7862014-2b30-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html\">moral dilemma</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"All these things ran through my head as a kid. And it was at that point that I started to recognize that books were not simple stories with all these Disney kind of happy endings where everything works out perfectly for everybody and everyone is happy,\" said Dirda. It showed him that \"in fact, life is much more complicated and that there are some issues where there isn't a clear cut answer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1920x1502+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fde%2F1f9a940641569cdc37dc1c6a9728%2Fhenry-huggins-jacqueline-rogers-aquarium.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of Henry Huggins.\"/>\n    <p>\n                An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of <i>Henry Huggins.</i>\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    HarperCollins\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <h3>A different dilemma: Native American stereotypes</h3>\n    <p>For decades, Cleary has been praised for her authenticity when describing the experiences of average, middle-class kids. In 1999, Beverly Cleary <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/26/311881785/beverly-cleary-creator-of-ramona-quimby-dies-at-104\">told</a> NPR, \"I think children like to find themselves in books.\" But her lead characters are white, and some of the plotlines perpetuate stereotypes.</p>\n    <p>In more than one Henry book, he pretends to be an American Indian. He's cast as \"Second Indian\" in a school play: He wears a robe and a feather from his mother's duster and says \"Ugh!\" In another book, his mother pretends to be afraid of him when he's dressed up as an Indian for Halloween.</p>\n    <p>Debbie Reese, who writes the blog <a href=\"https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2023/02/stereotypes-in-beverly-clearys-henry.html\">American Indians In Children's Literature</a>, says that while she understands why <i>Henry Huggins</i> is popular, she worries that white kids might \"read right through that problematic content … and not recognize it as harmful or a misrepresentation.\"</p>\n    <p>But Reese says the offensive text shouldn't be excised. She advises educators and parents to make it a teachable moment and tell kids: \"Oh, here's a mistake. That's not true. Native people didn't do this or they didn't look like that. I would like them to take it head on and say that it's a mistake.\"</p>\n    <p>Reese wants young readers and their families to know that \"books are not sacred. They are just someone's words, someone's stories. And some of those stories are wrong.\" At the same time, Reese said she \"wasn't surprised that it had problematic content because most of those classic books do.\"</p>\n    <p>To date, Cleary's first novel has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. She wrote five more <i>Henry Huggins</i> books, with the final one in the series revolving around his canine companion <i>Ribsy</i>. Another character in the series, his mischievous neighbor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/07/23/128689937/ramona-quimby-the-mischievous-girl-next-door\">Ramona Quimby</a>, was so popular that Cleary gave her an eponymous series of her own.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Meghan Sullivan</i>\n      <i> edited this story for broadcast and digital.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5418029/henry-huggins-beverly-cleary-ramona-quimby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>After a quarter century defending digital rights, Cindy Cohn announced on Tuesday that she is stepping down as executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Cohn, who has led the San Francisco–based nonprofit since 2015, says she will leave the role later this year, concluding a chapter that helped define the modern fight over online freedom.</p>\n<p>Cohn first rose to prominence as lead counsel in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1996/06/esbernstein/\"> Bernstein v. Department of Justice</a>, the 1990s case that overturned federal restrictions on publishing encryption code. As EFF’s legal director and later executive director, she guided the group through legal challenges to </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/surveillance/\">government surveillance</a>, reforms to computer crime laws, and efforts to hold corporations accountable for data collection. Over the past decade, EFF has expanded its influence, becoming a central force in shaping the debate over privacy, security, and digital freedom.</p>\n<p>In an interview with WIRED, Cohn reflected on EFF’s foundational encryption victories, its unfinished battles against <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/\">National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance</a>, and the organization’s work protecting independent security researchers. She spoke about the shifting balance of power between corporations and governments, the push for stronger state-level privacy laws, and the growing risks posed by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Though stepping down from leadership, Cohn tells WIRED she plans to remain active in the fight against mass surveillance and government secrecy. Describing herself as “more of a warrior than a manager,” she says her intent is to return to frontline advocacy. She is also at work on a forthcoming book, <i>Privacy’s Defender</i>, due out next spring, which she hopes will inspire a new generation of digital rights advocates.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>WIRED: Tell us about the fights you won, and the ones that still feel unfinished after 25 years.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>CINDY COHN</strong>: The early fight that we made to free up encryption from government regulation still stands out as setting the stage for a potentially secure internet. We're still working on turning that promise into a reality, but we're in such a different place than we would've been in had we lost that fight. Encryption protects anybody who buys anything online, anyone who uses Signal to be a whistleblower or journalists, or just regular people who want privacy and use <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-privacy-security-settings/\">WhatsApp</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/\">Signal</a>. Even the backend-certificate authorities provided by Let’s Encrypt—that make sure that when you think you're going to your bank, you're actually going to your bank website—are all made possible because of encryption. These are all things that would've been at risk if we hadn't won that fight. I think that win was foundational, even though the fights aren't over.</p>\n<p>The fights that we've had around the NSA and national security, those are still works in progress. We were not successful with our big challenge to the NSA spying in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2009/07/jewel/\"> Jewel v. NSA</a>, although over the long arc of that case and the accompanying legislative fights, we managed to claw back quite a bit of what the NSA started doing after 9/11.</p>\n<p>But it's unfinished business. A related question is the government's misuse of national security justifications to violate people's rights, including their privacy. I think it's especially important now that we do something about the misuse of national security arguments and secrecy, because in the hands of the Trump administration, it's become an all-purpose tool to go after political enemies, violate people’s rights, and to do so many other things that we have been warning about for years.</p>\n<p>Another thing that we've really accomplished at EFF that is sometimes overlooked is in the work we call “coders rights;” especially protecting people who do independent security research. The first year I was at EFF, the FBI arrested somebody at Defcon for having the audacity to reveal that Adobe's security on one of their products was lousy—the guy was Dmitry Sklyarov. Dramatic arrests of security researchers don’t happen anymore, thankfully. We’ve seen the software world really evolve on this. Now companies have bug-bounty programs to reward independent security researchers. And companies like Microsoft have come a long way in devoting themselves to security and supporting security research. While we still occasionally have to stand up for somebody revealing security flaws more often outside of traditional areas of software development for things like security in cars or medical devices, we just passed another Defcon where we didn’t have to bail anyone out of jail or fight a gag order, and that’s cause for celebration.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Tech companies often claim to take privacy seriously, even as many expand surveillance-driven business models. At this point, who poses the greater risk to personal privacy—government agencies or corporations?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>One thing that I've learned at EFF is that there isn't a bright line between those two. The NSA spying that we talk about was the NSA using the telecommunications, internet, and communications companies to spy on us.</p>\n<p>We’re seeing a lot more skepticism when it comes to company promises that they “take our privacy seriously.” The thing that jumps to my mind right now is the largest jury verdict in history just happened here in San Francisco on a privacy issue involving Google. That kind of tells you that people are pretty fed up, and they really don't think that the companies have their best interests at heart. And that wasn't always true.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/eff-cindy-cohn-stepping-down/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A first-of-its-kind marketplace <a href=\"https://thepublicservicealliance.com/\">rolled out on Tuesday</a> offering free and discounted privacy and security services to America’s 23 million current and former public servants. The marketplace is offered by Public Service Alliance (PSA), a private company that says it formed in response to an unprecedented rise in threats against government workers across the United States.</p>\n<p>Open to anyone who is serving or has served in government—federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial—the platform debuts amid heightened concern over the safety of public officials and their families, especially in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/christian-nationalist-roots-suspected-minnesota-assassin/\">June killing</a> of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and the attempted assassination of state senator John Hoffman and his wife.</p>\n<p>“Threats to public servants and their families have surged over the past decade, with no scalable support for those at risk. This is a broken business model for effective government and undermines everything America stands for,” PSA founder and CEO Isabella Ulloa says in a statement.</p>\n<p>The group says its marketplace is designed to connect public servants—from veterans and judges to first responders and lawmakers—with resources spanning four areas: privacy and security, legal and communications risk, career support, and personal well-being. The services, which anyone can browse for free, include online data removal, legal counsel, threat monitoring, job coaching, and stress management tools.</p>\n<p>After creating a free account and attesting to their government service, users will receive codes that unlock reduced rates from vetted vendors: data-privacy firms like Optery and Atlas, which help remove personal information from the web and keep it from reappearing; Alethea, a security firm that monitors for online harassment and physical threats; and Lifemart, which offers discounted lifestyle and wellness products. Additionally, while it does not itself provide legal advice, PSA says it can connect users to a network of attorneys that provide low-cost legal consultations.</p>\n<p>During a quiet launch last year, PSA tells WIRED, it amassed roughly 1,000 users by word of mouth alone, saying it so far touts a 100 percent retention rate. Users pay a 10 percent fee (based on the discounted rate of the services used) to help maintain the platform, but waivers are available for those for whom the added cost becomes prohibitive. Many of the discounts are steep, PSA says, noting that threat monitoring services, which can range from $5,000 to over $30,000 annually, can be obtained by its users for less than $1,000 per year.</p>\n<p>PSA casts itself as strictly nonpartisan, pointing to an advisory board that spans both parties as well as members of law enforcement, including former Republican congresswoman Barbara Comstock, Massachusetts sheriff Peter Koutoujian, and David Sundberg, a retired FBI assistant director. Ulloa, the founder, recently worked for the Department of Homeland Security. PSA says the bipartisan structure underscores its view that protecting people’s lives should always transcend politics.</p>\n<p>The group says it has plans to extend access to the discounts to other at-risk groups, including nonprofit workers, later this year.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/intimidation-state-and-local-officeholders\">January report</a> by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy nonprofit, underscored the widespread nature of the threats and harassment public officials are facing. Its researchers found that nearly half of state legislators and nearly one in five local officials reported being threatened, many saying the abuse has intensified in both frequency and tone. Women and officials of color bear the abuse at rates several times that of their peers.</p>\n<p>The threats are not only endangering people, the center says, but warping democratic participation; deterring candidates from running for office and silencing officials on controversial issues, pushing many to scale back public events and social media use.</p>\n<p>The US Capitol Police says it investigated <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2024\">9,474 threats</a> against members of Congress and those close to them last year, marking a second straight annual increase, more than doubling 2017’s total.</p>\n<p>Data brokers, which are often used for targeted abuse, sit at the heart of a multibillion-dollar industry that thrives on collecting, packaging, and selling detailing personal information, often without your knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers on nearly every American, from their location histories to political leanings and even religious affiliations. This data is sold and resold for a variety of purposes, ranging from targeting advertising to law-enforcement surveillance and immigration control.</p>\n<p>The risks are not abstract. People-search websites, which draw heavily on data broker feeds, have long been <a href=\"https://www.techsafety.org/data-brokers\">used by abusers</a> to track and harass victims. Data breaches have exposed the movements of politicians and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/phone-data-us-soldiers-spies-nuclear-germany/\">military personnel</a>. And even when opting out is possible, it’s a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/data-brokers-hiding-opt-out-pages-google-search/\">burdensome, piecemeal process</a> that requires repeatedly chasing down companies as information is re-collected and relisted.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has orchestrated a major rollback of efforts to rein in data broker abuse pursued by ex-Biden administration officials. In May 2025, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\">quietly withdrew</a> a Biden-era rule that would have required data brokers to get people’s consent before selling sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers or income details.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, privacy watchdogs like the Electronic Frontier Foundation report that hundreds of data brokers are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/693109/eff-privacy-advocates-state-investigate-data-brokers\">evading state transparency laws</a>—including failing to register in states where it’s required—further eroding oversight in the absence of federal regulation; a gap that’s left even basic privacy protections vulnerable to corporate gamesmanship.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/public-service-alliance-marketplace-privacy-threats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A leak of more than 100,000 documents shows that a little-known Chinese company has been quietly selling censorship systems seemingly modeled on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/04/high-tech-low-life/\">Great Firewall</a> to governments around the world.</p>\n<p>Geedge Networks, a company founded in 2018 that counts the “father” of China’s massive censorship infrastructure as one of its investors, styles itself as a network-monitoring provider, offering business-grade cybersecurity tools to “gain comprehensive visibility and minimize security risks” for its customers, the documents show. In fact, researchers found that it has been operating a sophisticated system that allows users to monitor online information, block certain websites and VPN tools, and spy on specific individuals.</p>\n<p>Researchers who reviewed the leaked material found that the company is able to package advanced surveillance capabilities into what amounts to a commercialized version of the Great Firewall—a wholesale solution with both hardware that can be installed in any telecom data center and software operated by local government officers. The documents also discuss desired functions that the company is working on, such as cyberattack-for-hire and geofencing certain users.</p>\n<p>According to the leaked documents, Geedge has already entered operation in Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Myanmar, as well as another unidentified country. A public job posting shows that Geedge is also looking for engineers who can travel to other countries for engineering work, including to several countries not named in the leaked documents, WIRED has found.</p>\n<p>The files, including Jira and Confluence entries, source code, and correspondence with a Chinese academic institution, mostly involve internal technical documentation, operation logs, and communications to solve issues and add functionalities. Provided through an anonymous leak, the files were studied by a consortium of human rights and media organizations including Amnesty International, InterSecLab, Justice For Myanmar, Paper Trail Media, The Globe and Mail, the Tor Project, the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, and Follow The Money.</p>\n<p>“This is not like lawful interception that every country does, including Western democracies,” says Marla Rivera, a technical researcher at InterSecLab, a global digital forensics research institution. In addition to mass censorship, the system allows governments to target specific individuals based on their website activities, like having visited a certain domain.</p>\n<p>The surveillance system that Geedge is selling “gives so much power to the government that really nobody should have,” Rivera says. “This is very frightening.”</p>\n<h2>Digital Authoritarianism as a Service</h2>\n<p>At the core of Geedge’s offering is a gateway tool called Tiangou Secure Gateway (TSG), designed to sit inside data centers and could be scaled to process the internet traffic of an entire country, <a href=\"https://interseclab.org/research/the-internet-coup/\">documents reveal</a>. According to researchers, every packet of internet traffic runs through it, where it can be scanned, filtered, or stopped outright. Besides monitoring the entire traffic, documents show that the system also allows setting up additional rules for specific users that it deems suspicious and collecting their network activities.</p>\n<p>For unencrypted internet traffic, the system is able to intercept sensitive information such as website content, passwords, and email attachments, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/09/pakistan-mass-surveillance-and-censorship-machine-is-fueled-by-chinese-european-emirati-and-north-american-companies/\">according to the leaked documents</a>. If the content is properly encrypted through the Transport Layer Security protocol, the system uses deep packet inspection and machine learning techniques to extract metadata from the encrypted traffic and predict whether it’s going through a censorship circumvention tool like a VPN. If it can’t distinguish the content of the encrypted traffic, the system can also opt to flag it as suspicious and block it for a period of time.</p>\n<p>One screenshot of the Geedge dashboard for Myanmar shows that the system is monitoring 81 million internet connections simultaneously, while it can theoretically be scaled even larger with more hardware, InterSecLab researchers say. Other documents show that as of February 2024, Geedge’s equipment had been installed in 26 data centers across 13 internet service providers in Myanmar. Frontiir, a local telecom operator in Myanmar, previously denied having “built, planned, or designed anything related to surveillance,” but it was found in the leak to have installed Geedge equipment at its data center. Investcom, a joint-venture telecom operator between Burmese and Lebanese companies, said it was “aware of claims relating to third-party technologies in Myanmar” but refused to “confirm or deny the existence of third-party systems” in <a href=\"https://www.justiceformyanmar.org/stories/silk-road-of-surveillance\">a written reply to the researchers at Justice for Myanmar</a>.</p>\n<p>Geedge sells a one-stop shop of censorship solutions, including internet gateway hardware. According to InterSecLab, Geedge originally used Western brand equipment from HP and Dell, but later moved to using hardware manufactured by Chinese companies to avoid being impacted by potential sanctions.</p>\n<p>Another fundamental product of Geedge is Cyber Narrator, the main user interface where non-technical government clients can access the data that Tiangou Secure Gateway monitors in real time with a bird’s-eye view, documents show.

    "body": "<p>Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, writing to you as I finish the audiobook version of Don DeLillo’s White Noise, which I can’t say I found compelling.</p>\n<p>In tech – artificial intelligence is having its day in court with an 11th-hour appearance in Google’s landmark antitrust trial and Anthropic’s major settlement with book authors.</p>\n<h2>Why OpenAI helped Google skirt a Chrome sale</h2>\n<p>Google dodged a catastrophic breakup, and it has its biggest competitor to thank for that, according to the judge who could have forced the tech giant to sell off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome\">Chrome</a>, the most popular web browser in the world, and perhaps Android, the world’s most widely used mobile operating system.</p>\n<p>Amit Mehta, who ruled in 2024 that Google had built and maintained an illegal monopoly over the internet search business, said last week that he would not force the most drastic remedy on the tech giant. The US government had requested that Mehta enjoin Google to divest Chrome. Instead, the company is prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution agreements for its search engine – but not barred from distribution agreements entirely – and must share data from its search business with competitors. Google is expected to appeal, but for now, one can imagine Sundar Pichai breathing a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>Critics said the penalties were weak, nothing more than a “slap on the wrist”, a phrase that appeared at least half a dozen times in the statements that flooded my inbox after the ruling came down.</p>\n<p>The reason for the relative tameness of the penalty is the emergence of real competition to Google – what the case concerned in the first place. United States v Google may have focused on search, but its aftermath concerned generative artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>“The emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case,” Mehta wrote. “These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among general search engines as ensuring that Google’s dominance in search does not carry over into the generative AI space.”</p>\n<p>Mehta said that in a prior era, internet search attracted neither investment nor innovation, so great was the fear of and dominance exerted by Google. That is no longer the case. Generative AI companies are attracting hundreds of billions of dollars in investment to create new products that threaten the primacy of internet search. It is no secret which company Mehta is referring to: he namechecks OpenAI and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt\">ChatGPT</a> 30 times each in his ruling.</p>\n<p>“These companies already are in a better position, both financially and technologically, to compete with Google than any traditional search company has been in decades,” Mehta wrote. “These new realities give the court hope that Google will not simply outbid competitors for distribution if superior products emerge. It also weighs in favor of ‘caution’ before disadvantaging Google in this highly competitive space.”</p>\n<p>Google has been Safari’s default search option since the iPhone debuted nearly 20 years ago. By contrast, you can see the competition in generative AI in action in Apple’s treatment of Google and OpenAI. In June 2024, Apple announced that it would partner with OpenAI on features for the iPhone. In August 2025, though, Apple engaged in talks with Google about using Gemini to revamp the beleaguered Siri, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/apple-explores-using-google-gemini-ai-to-power-revamped-siri\">Bloomberg</a>. May the best bot win.</p>\n<p>In April, I predicted that OpenAI would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/22/the-us-government-is-coming-for-google-and-meta-but-what-will-happen-next\">emerge as a potential buyer for Chrome</a>, would perhaps even take a chance on buying it. At the very least, the ChatGPT maker would benefit from a weakened Google. Later that month, an OpenAI executive testified that the company would <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-contemplated-exclusive-gemini-ai-deals-with-android-makers-2025-04-22/\">want to do just that</a>.</p>\n<p>It is poetic that OpenAI’s success saved Google. Perhaps the upstart owes the favor to its forebear. After all, a paper produced by Google researchers did provide the theoretical basis for ChatGPT. Researchers from the Mountain View campus proposed the foundational architecture that would make ChatGPT possible in 2017.</p>\n<p>Google, valued at $2.84tn, is surely the Goliath in this scenario to the David of OpenAI, possibly worth $500bn. Lest you think OpenAI is not Google’s biggest competition, put your ear close to the horse’s mouth. In December 2022, Google’s own management declared the nascent popularity of ChatGPT a “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html\">code red</a>” for its lucrative search business, which brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Pichai himself reassigned vast hordes of Google’s employees to artificial intelligence projects.</p>\n<p>Unlike Goliath, who disregarded his puny, slinging challenger, Google itself acknowledged that ChatGPT’s release, which marked the arrival of generative AI in the popular consciousness, had changed the competitive landscape. The threat was grave.</p>\n<p>Google has caught up to OpenAI in the AI race, but the David in the fight still holds the sling of first mover advantage. ChatGPT remains synonymous with generative AI, and perhaps AI in general, in the minds of many people. Google is enormous, though, and still the incumbent player. Billions of people encountering its search engine’s AI Overviews on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Google may have dodged catastrophe with Mehta’s decision to allow Chrome to remain in the fold. The wolves, however, are still circling. The tech giant faces another antitrust hearing later this year regarding the technology that underpins its advertising business, the financial engine of the company. Google owns the distribution mechanisms of online ad sales, and the digital location where the sale is taking place.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/08/google-antitrust-apocalypse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

After hours of driving, they were herded, tired and bemused, into a boat for a river crossing.</p>\n<p>The men were being taken to neighbouring Myanmar, where Okindo found himself inside a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0129\">walled compound guarded by rebel militia</a>.</p>\n<p>He was set to work every day for the next three months, forced to send thousands of messages from fake social-media profiles, posing as a rich American investor to swindle US real estate agents into cryptocurrency scams.</p>\n<p>When he failed to reach daily targets, he was beaten, locked inside a freezing-cold room and deprived of food for up to two days.

She served in Sir Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet before the general election and expected to be offered a cabinet job in his government after Labour had won.</p>\n    <p>No such offer came.</p>\n    <p>Now she is running to be deputy leader of the party.

Welfare. Gaza. Wealth tax,\" she wrote, adding, archly that she wouldn't \"just nod along,\" a line seemingly aimed at Phillipson and Alison McGovern, the other candidate who is also a government minister.</p>\n    <p>Imagine Labour's deputy leader, were Thornberry to win, spending the autumn talking up a wealth tax, in the weeks before the Budget in November.</p>\n    <p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, she has a lot of MPs to find to back her.</p>\n    <p>Attempting to do that, and in just a few days, led Ribeiro-Addy to publicly complain about the process being anti democratic.</p>\n    <p>She has also criticised the government for not scrapping the two-child benefit cap, she wants a full arms embargo and sanctions to be imposed on Israel, and the ban on Palestine Action to be removed.</p>\n    <p>Of course, hers is a campaign that may only last a few days. Let's see.</p>\n    <p>So, how many of the candidates are serious contenders here, and who are they?</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson is well on the way to 80 MPs backing her already, with 44.</p>\n    <p>Lucy Powell isn't far behind with 35.</p>\n    <p>The others are all in single figures.</p>\n    <p>But hundreds of Labour MPs are yet to endorse anyone.</p>\n    <p>The key question now is which candidates clear this first hurdle, and how many of them are not in government and so more free to criticise it as the race heads to its next stage?</p>\n    <p>This is likely to be a key factor in shaping the tenor and tone of the debate that follows – and the eventual winner.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

    "body": "<p>It’s not exactly every parent’s dream dinner-table conversation: “Mum, what’s porn?” But whether we like it or not, many children stumble across mainstream internet pornography. A recent study in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/18/children-exposure-to-porn-online-safety-act-commissioner\">found that</a> more than a quarter of children encounter porn online before the age of 11. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf\">studies show</a> the average age of first exposure to online porn is 12, with some encountering it earlier. For many parents, that knowledge can spark panic: “What if this is the first place my child learns about sex? What if they think that’s what real intimacy looks like?”</p>\n<p>Here’s the good news: you don’t need to panic, but you do need to prepare. The truth is, your child will be exposed to ideas about sex, whether through peers, media or yes, pornography. And it will happen – long before you’d ideally want it to. The most protective factor isn’t monitoring phones or giving lectures. It’s you showing up as an honest, calm and approachable parent.</p>\n<p>Here’s an approach to make the conversation less intimidating.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Set the stage</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>First, set the stage for yourself. If you start from fear: (“Oh no, my child might see this terrible thing!”), the conversation will probably be shut down quickly. But if you ground yourself, it changes everything.</p>\n<p>Think about the bigger picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/pornography\">Pornography</a> is not going away. Equipping your child to understand what they see and to ask questions is far more effective than pretending it doesn’t exist.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Start with your values</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Before talking about porn, take a moment to reflect on what you <i>do</i> want your child to know about sex and relationships. Do you want them to value consent? To understand that intimacy is about connection, not just performance? To know that their bodies (and other people’s bodies) deserve care and dignity?</p>\n<p>Rooting the conversation in your family’s values shifts the focus from “don’t watch this” to “here’s what we believe about relationships – and why porn doesn’t offer that”. It usually shows a very narrow version of sex. One that skips over communication, respect or even mutual pleasure.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Explain what porn is (and what it isn’t)</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>There is a wide spectrum of adult content, including work that’s ethical and respectful. But most of what young people stumble across online isn’t that. It’s mainstream porn, which often misrepresents sex and relationships.</p>\n<p>The key here is to use language that matches your child’s age and developmental stage. For tweens, a simple definition works: “Porn is when people make videos or pictures of sex to sell online.” For teens, you might add: “It’s entertainment, like a movie, but it misrepresents relationships, emotions and sex itself.”</p>\n<p>The main point: porn is entertainment, not sex education.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Keep it open and shame-free</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Many parents worry: “If I talk about porn, won’t it make my child want to watch it?” Talking about porn doesn’t spark curiosity, it builds critical thinking. Kids are already exposed to sexual content through media, jokes and the internet. Silence doesn’t protect them, it just leaves them figuring it out alone.</p>\n<p>This is where being “askable” comes in. If your child knows they can come to you with a question (even an awkward, cringe-inducing one) and not get shut down, they’re far more likely to seek your guidance in the future. That means resisting the urge to overreact when the subject comes up. A deep breath, a calm tone, and phrases such as:</p>\n<p>● “That’s a good question, let’s talk about it.”</p>\n<p>● “I’m glad you asked me instead of just Googling it.”</p>\n<p>● “I don’t have all the answers, but we can figure it out together.”</p>\n<p>That’s the energy that makes you the go-to resource, not the last resort.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Practical conversation starters</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Many parents just want to know what to say.<i> </i>Here are ways to start the conversation, depending on your child’s age, plus how to gauge where they’re at.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Warm it up with a temperature check</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Ask your child what they already know or have heard.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-24\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>●<i> </i>“Have you ever seen something online that made you feel weird or uncomfortable?”</p>\n<p>● If yes: “Oh really? Tell me more about that.”</p>\n<p>● If no or unsure: “Thanks for your honesty. Let me ask you this: what do you think of when you hear the words ‘adult content’ or ‘sexually explicit material’?”</p>\n<p>This might give you an idea of what they’ve seen so you can tailor your response.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Tailor your response</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>● Younger tweens (10–12):</p>\n<p>“Sometimes kids see things online that aren’t made for them, like pornography. It might show people’s bodies and sexual stuff, but not what real relationships look like. If you ever see something that makes you uncomfortable, you can tell me.”</p>\n<p>● Teens:</p>\n<p>“You might hear about porn from friends, or even see it yourself. Just so you know, it’s made to be entertainment, not education. Real sex involves communication, consent, and care – things mainstream porn usually skips.”</p>\n<p>● For any age:</p>\n<p>“I know this can feel awkward, but I’d rather we talk about it together than leave you to figure it out alone.”</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Keep the conversation going</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>The goal isn’t covering everything at once. It’s about creating an ongoing dialogue so your child knows your door is open and their questions won’t be met with judgment or punishment. Small, honest conversations over time are what stick.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/08/parents-porn-talk-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That's not so clear.</p>\n    <p>At the weekend John Healey, the defence secretary, said the government was looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels.</p>\n    <p>That was in the works before the reshuffle. It may be that Mahmood seeks to accelerate the timetable for closing hotels.</p>\n    <p>Sir Keir has said that he wants to close them all before the next general election though he alluded in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live last week to bringing that deadline forward.</p>\n    <p>Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from which both Reform UK and increasingly the Conservatives say the UK must withdraw to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was looking at ways to change UK law to make clearer to judges here the way in which the government believes the convention should be interpreted.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood may want to go further but it is hard to see how that would be possible given Lord Hermer, who remains in post as attorney general, not to mention the prime minister himself, are both ardently opposed to withdrawal.</p>\n    <p>We may not need to wait long to find out what Mahmood's new direction will be. Only a week after taking office as justice secretary last year, she announced plans to release thousands of prisoners earlier than planned to avoid what she called \"total collapse\" of the prison system.</p>\n    <p>Her handling of prison overcrowding, especially her willingness to grasp the nettle so early on, has been frequently compared favourably by Labour MPs to other cabinet ministers who were seen as taking too long to work out how they wanted to deal with their portfolios.</p>\n    <p>One ally of Mahmood told the BBC: \"She knows that time is of the essence. She didn't take long to take big decisions at the Ministry of Justice, and she doesn't tend to hang about.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95ec/live/97747df0-8ca2-11f0-a721-a79c3c3eadc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Shabana Mahmood visits HMP Bedford, alongside the prison's governor, Sarah Bott. The pair walk along a while corridor and in the background there is a prison officer holding open a white gate.\"/>\n    <p>One of the biggest changes might come in rhetoric and communication style.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was shadow home secretary for seven years in two stints and also spent five years as chairwoman of the home affairs select committee. Some in Labour pushing for a harder line on immigration occasionally complained that her deep knowledge of the issues involved made her public comments too nuanced to embody public dissatisfaction.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is likely to go another way.</p>\n    <p>That was definitely the sense from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7xyn03yno\">her first brief interview in the role</a> on Monday, in which she repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration, suggested she could withdraw visas from countries that do not \"play ball\" on migrant returns and embraced the potential introduction of ID cards  - all in clear, plain language.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood, 44, has been an MP for 15 years representing a constituency in Birmingham, but it is only in the past two years that she has moved into front-line, high-profile roles.</p>\n    <p>After spending her first five years in Parliament in a range of junior shadow ministerial portfolios, she co-chaired Cooper's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 2015. She then refused to serve under Jeremy Corbyn, instead dedicating her time during his leadership to fighting those on Labour's left-wing from a position on Labour's national executive committee, to which she was elected by Labour MPs.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, at the lowest ebb of Sir Keir's leadership, she was brought into the shadow cabinet to take charge of Labour's election campaign infrastructure. Even in that job, though, she was pushing her party to get over what she called its \"queasiness\" about talking tough on immigration.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/shabana-mahmood-the-woman-behind-labours-election-campaign-pk5vx3bn3\">In an interview with the Times in 2023</a>, she said: \"In the commentariat, among very politically engaged people, there's a sort of assumption about who is motivated by immigration as an electoral issue. </p>\n    <p>\"My constituency experience is that, actually, that's not got very much to do with race. I represent a very diverse constituency that's 70% non-white, and immigration comes up as an issue that my voters who are black or Asian and from other ethnic minorities want to talk about.\"</p>\n    <p>That is an argument you can be sure she will be making as home secretary in the coming weeks.</p>\n    <p>Whether she can address those concerns will determine not just her political fortunes but those of this government and prime minister too.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Firstly, she’s the Mother Teresa of Aussie supermarkets. Secondly, I don’t know anything about her personally because this savvy queen doesn’t market herself like your average influencer. She lets her work speak for itself.</p>\n    <p>The work in question? Weekly uploads of POV-style videos where Tennille meticulously goes through major supermarkets to show you what’s on special that week. Her soothing voice and steady hand shepherds you through a sea of yellow price tags. It’s detailed work, considerate and necessary.</p>\n    <p>This article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n    <p>A deep shame I used to harbour is that I would wait by my phone every Monday at 5pm for the Coles and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/woolworths-australia\">Woolworths</a> catalogues to drop. Wednesday was even more special – that’s Aldi catalogue day, and nothing can rival the feeling of a niche European snack or a new power-cleaning tool with a 75% discount.</p>\n    <p>For me, looking through a supermarket catalogue produces a frisson I’ve only ever experienced while scouring the Royal Easter Show showbag booklet as a child of the early 2000s. The excitement I would feel running my finger over each lolly listed in the $15 (slightly offensively named) Mega Sumo Bag. The burden picking between Wonka or Wizz Fizz because I knew my mum wouldn’t let me get both. A supermarket catalogue offers the same thrill: an anticipation of what could soon be yours.</p>\n    <p>But the days of flipping through paper catalogues are well and truly over. That’s why Tennilles_deals is so important, giving us tight, three-minute videos that provide us with a 360-degree view of each product: a walking, talking catalogue. We’re in the combat zone of the Woolies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/coles\">Coles</a> duopoly with her and she is protecting us, guiding us through each aisle. She is our mum. We are her children.</p>\n    <p>And I’m not alone in the admiration I have for this woman. There’s a reason Tennilles_deals has amassed almost 100,000 followers. She offers the people something the mega-chain supermarkets could never: a personable touch; a space where cash-strapped Aussies can vent about price-gouging.</p>\n    <p>One of her videos about the price of extra virgin olive oil starts a debate in the comments. Kerry from Tamworth says she remembers when it was only $7; we love-react Kerry’s comment in solidarity. She is not alone. We are not alone. Barry from Wagga Wagga voices outrage on the Cadbury chocolate block deal. We agree that two for $10 is ridiculous and we remember the simpler $3 block days. Barry then says something out of the blue about his hot cousin, but we ignore it because we agreed about the chocolate thing and we don’t need to go any further.</p>\n    <p>The effect of cozzie livs gives the average Australian fear when entering a supermarket. Gone are the days when I would enter a store without a list and a finite plan of what to purchase. Having the opportunity to see that I can get five Chobani pots for $10 soothes me. As do the gently encouraging words of Carol from Broken Hill: “Do not pass up that Chobani deal.” It means I can enter a Woolies free from the anxiety that I’ll go over budget in pursuit of protecting my gut microbiome.</p>\n    <p>This article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, <strong>click 'Allow and continue'</strong>.</p>\n    <p>What Tennilles_deals is doing is building community. “Australian of the year,” one TikToker comments under her “Woolworths half price items spotted in store this week 29/7/25” post – and I couldn’t reply with three fire emojis more quickly if I tried.</p>\n    <p>Unfortunately, nominations for 2026 Australian of the year are closed, so my only way to show my respect is via this very public essay. Keep doing the lord’s work, Tennille. The people love you and the people need you. You’re the real deal.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/08/woman-cataloguing-grocery-deals-on-tiktok-mother-teresa-aussie-supermarkets-tennilles-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She seems to be everywhere you turn in Birmingham, popping up on three panels, including two appearances on the main stage.</p>\n    <p>A lawyer and former prosecutor, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK in June, she says she entered politics to improve outcomes for the victims of crime.</p>\n    <p>A Conservative supporter since a teenager, Cunningham says she was a \"huge fan\" of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n    <p>\"But the Tory party changed,\" she says, accusing the Conservatives of failures over home ownership, taxation and crime over many years.</p>\n    <p>She has been tipped to be Reform's candidate for the London mayoral election in 2028, although she's coy about that prospect and stresses the party hasn't even started the selection process yet.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll help the party in any way they need me,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Atkinson is the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council - another name party bosses have high hopes for.</p>\n    <p>A self-taught engineer who set up a business that makes school furniture, Atkinson rose through the ranks of local politics with the Conservative Party in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>Then the Brexit years came, and like an increasing number of Reform UK's new joiners, Atkinson quit the Conservatives after becoming disillusioned with the party.</p>\n    <p>Since becoming council leader in Lancashire in May, Atkinson says he has focused on the \"huge financial challenges\" facing his Reform UK administration, alongside bread-and-butter issues such as fixing potholes.</p>\n    <p>In the future, he says, it would be a \"great honour\" to be a parliamentary candidate for the party where he lives in the Ribble Valley, if he was selected.</p>\n    <p>\"But that's a decision for other people,\" he adds.</p>\n    <p>If Reform does manage to get into government, and four years out from a general election it is still a very big \"if\", some of the party's would-be MPs may find fewer opportunities to rise to the highest levels of politics.</p>\n    <p>Farage and Zia Yusuf, the party's new head of policy, have talked about appointing dozens of new peers to take up roles in a Reform UK cabinet.</p>\n    <p>Could former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries - unveiled this week to much fanfare as Reform UK's latest Tory defector - be drafted into the Lords?</p>\n    <p>Former Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry was also doing the media rounds in Birmingham, and was seen walking into Friday night's afterparty in the main hall, where US pop legends the Jacksons made a surprise appearance on stage.</p>\n    <p>Like one of the back-up singers, Berry may be one of those called upon to make up the numbers in one of the many elections Reform UK wants to win.</p>\n    <p>In his conference speech, Farage said the party was taking the London mayoral election \"seriously\", as well as polls in Wales and Scotland next year.</p>\n    <p>He said Reform needed 5,000 vetted candidates to fight those polls, which he called \"an essential building block as we head towards a general election\".</p>\n    <p>As he closed the Birmingham conference, he called for volunteers in the audience to get to their feet if they wanted to stand in next year's elections.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the people's army in operation,\" Farage said.</p>\n    <p>In a symbolic gesture, some in the audience did stand, but the actual process for selection is designed to be far more rigorous.</p>\n    <p>Candidate selection has always been a thorny issue for Farage's various electoral vehicles, with election campaigns blown off course by scandals.</p>\n    <p>Party insiders like to describe Reform's rapid expansion - while ensuring candidates are properly vetted - as being like assembling a jumbo jet while flying it.</p>\n    <p>They insist they have improved their vetting system since last year's general election, after some candidates were ditched or suspended over offensive comments on social media ahead of the general election.</p>\n    <p>The party now has assessment centres, where candidates are put through their paces, and a centre for excellence, where activists are caught how to campaign effectively.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1182/live/c3cf4aa0-8b1d-11f0-b7cb-a948b12ba583.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Stephen Atkinson, the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council\"/>\n    <p>Thomas Kerr, the former group leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy48p5132qno\">defected to Reform in January</a>, was also doing the rounds of the fringe panels in Birmingham, and says he hopes to stand in next year's Holyrood elections.</p>\n    <p>Asked if Reform UK is one-man band, Kerr says: \"I don't think that if Farage was to fall under a bus that Reform wouldn't be polling where we are, because of the momentum behind the party.\"</p>\n    <p>Is the party getting more recognisable spokespeople though?</p>\n    <p>\"I think they are slowly starting to do that,\" Kerr says.</p>\n    <p>\"You see people like me and others appearing on panels at fringe events at conferences. You'll be seeing people speaking at conferences.</p>\n    <p>\"We are four years from a general election, Nigel is the man we are hoping will be prime minister but there will be a team behind him.\"</p>\n    <p>And with that, Kerr is interrupted by a Tannoy announcement that \"Nigel Farage will be on the main stage at 1pm\", and a mad rush to the main stage ensues.</p>\n    <p>Minutes before, Farage told his team he had wanted to rip up the conference schedule and deliver his main speech early, to react to Angela Rayner resigning as deputy prime minister and other roles.</p>\n    <p>Reform UK's new faces do their best to put themselves in the frame.</p>\n    <p>But for now, this is a picture that's very much dominated by one big figure.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl1k744548o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Trump administration this week rescinded <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-contract-white-house-review/\">a Biden administration order</a> that blocked the ICE from obtaining hacking tools sold by Paragon, the Israeli firm with which it <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-solutions-contract/\">signed a $2 million contract last September</a>. Now ICE will have access to the company’s spyware, including tools for remotely breaking into phones and obtaining their contents and messages.</p>\n<p>Paragon has been compared to the more notorious Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, with similar examples of its tools being used to spy on journalists and activists: WhatsApp said earlier this year that it had discovered Paragon’s spyware being used against activists and journalists in Europe, and two Italian media outlets filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors seeking an investigation into the hacking incidents. As a result of that blowup, Italian intelligence services canceled a contract with the company, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-06-09/ty-article/.premium/paragon-questions-journalist-hack-probe-after-contract-nixed/00000197-511f-ddae-a1ff-5b5fb4bf0000\">according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz</a>.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration considered spyware used to hack phones controversial enough that it was tightly restricted for US government use in an executive order signed in March 2024. In Trump’s no-holds-barred effort to empower his deportation force—already by far the most well-funded law enforcement agency in the US government—that’s about to change, and the result could be a powerful new form of domestic surveillance.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://therecord.media/salesloft-drift-breach-cloudflare-zscaler-palo-alto-networks\">Security Companies Impacted in Hacking Campaign Against AI Chatbot Maker</a>\n    </h2>\n<p>Multiple tech and security companies—including Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, Spycloud, and Zscaler—have confirmed <a href=\"https://therecord.media/salesloft-drift-breach-cloudflare-zscaler-palo-alto-networks\">customer information was stolen in a hack</a> that originally targeted a chatbot system belonging to sales and revenue generation company Salesloft. The sprawling data theft started in August, but in recent days more companies have revealed they had customer information stolen.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of August, <a href=\"https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift%2FSalesforce+Security+Update\">Salesloft first confirmed</a> it had discovered a “security issue” in its Drift application, an AI chatbot system that allows companies to track potential customers who engage with the chatbot. The company said the security issue is linked to Drift’s integration with Salesforce. Between August 8 and August 18, hackers used compromised OAuth tokens associated with Drift to steal data from accounts.</p>\n<p>Google’s security researchers <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift?e=48754805\">revealed</a> the breach at the end of August. “The actor systematically exported large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances,” Google wrote in a blog post, pointing out that the hackers were looking for passwords and other credentials contained in the data. More than 700 companies may have been impacted, with Google later saying it had seen Drift’s email integration being abused.</p>\n<p>On August 28, Salesloft <a href=\"https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Salesloft+Security+Update%3A+Salesforce+Integrations+%286%3A15PM+ET%29\">paused</a> its Salesforce-Salesloft integration as it investigated the security issues; then on September 2 it <a href=\"https://trust.salesloft.com/?uid=Drift+Will+Be+Temporarily+Offline+%281%3A55PM+ET%29\">said</a>, “Drift will be temporarily taken offline in the very near future” so it can “build additional resiliency and security in the system.” It’s likely more companies impacted by the attack will notify customers in the coming days.</p>\n<h2>\n      <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/us/navy-seal-north-korea-trump-2019.html\">Seal Team 6 Tried—and Failed—to Plant a Spy Device in North Korea</a>\n    </h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-has-spyware-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When the chief executive of the Financial Times suggested at a media conference this summer that rival publishers might consider a “Nato for news” alliance to strengthen negotiations with artificial intelligence companies there was a ripple of chuckles from attendees.</p>\n<p>Yet Jon Slade’s revelation that his website had seen a “pretty sudden and sustained” decline of 25% to 30% in traffic to its articles from readers arriving via internet search engines quickly made clear the serious nature of the threat the AI revolution poses.</p>\n<p>Queries typed into sites such as Google, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/14/google-investigated-uk-search-dominance-cma-data\">accounts for more than 90% of the search market</a>, have been central to online journalism since its inception, with news providers optimising headlines and content to ensure a top ranking and revenue-raising clicks.</p>\n<p>But now Google’s AI Overviews, which sit at the top of the results page and summarise responses and often negate the need to follow links to content, as well as its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/20/google-ai-mode-search-engine-developers-conference\">recently launched AI Mode tab</a> that answers queries in a chatbot format, have prompted fears of a “Google zero” future where traffic referrals dry up.</p>\n<p>“This is the single biggest change to search I have seen in decades,” says one senior editorial tech executive. “Google has always felt like it would always be there for publishers. Now the one constant in digital publishing is undergoing a transformation that may completely change the landscape.”</p>\n<p>Last week, the owner of the Daily Mail revealed in its submission to the Competition and Markets Authority’s consultation on Google’s search services that AI Overviews have fuelled a drop in click-through traffic to its sites by as much as 89%.</p>\n<p>DMG Media and other leading news organisations, including Guardian Media Group and the magazine trade body the Professional Publishers Association (PPA), have urged the competition watchdog to <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/publishers-call-for-cma-to-include-gemini-in-google-investigation/\">make Google more transparent</a> and provide traffic statistics from AI Overview and AI Mode to publishers as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/14/google-investigated-uk-search-dominance-cma-data\">its investigation into the tech firm’s search dominance</a>.</p>\n<p>Publishers – already under financial pressure from soaring costs, falling advertising revenues, the decline of print and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety\">wider trend of readers turning away from news</a> – argue that they are effectively being forced by Google to either accept deals, including on how content is used in AI Overview and AI Mode, or “drop out of all search results”, according to several sources.</p>\n<p>On top of the threat to funding, there are concerns about AI’s impact on accuracy. While Google has improved the quality of its overviews since earlier iterations advised users <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/31/google-ai-summaries-sge-changes\">to eat rocks and add glue to pizza</a>, problems with “hallucinations” – where AI presents incorrect or fabricated information as fact – remain, as do issues with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/ai-discrimination-is-a-bigger-risk-than-human-extinction-eu-chief\">in-built bias</a>, when a computer rather than a human decides how to summarise sources.</p>\n<p>In January, Apple promised to update an AI feature that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/07/apple-update-ai-inaccurate-news-alerts-bbc-apple-intelligence-iphone\">issued untrue summaries of BBC news alerts</a>, stamped with the corporation’s logo, on its latest iPhones; alerts incorrectly claimed that the man accused of killing a US insurance boss had shot himself and that tennis star Rafael Nadal had come out as gay.</p>\n<p>In a blogpost last month, Liz Reid, Google’s head of search, said the introduction of AI in search was <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-search-driving-more-queries-higher-quality-clicks/\">“driving more queries and quality clicks”</a>.</p>\n<p>“This data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic,” she said. “[These reports] are often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the rollout of AI features in search.”</p>\n<p>However, she also said that while overall traffic to all websites is “relatively stable” she admitted that the “vast” web means that user trends are shifting traffic to different sites “resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others”.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Google Discover, which feeds users articles and videos tailored to them based on their past online activity, has replaced search as the main source of click-throughs to content.</p>\n<p>However, David Buttle, founder of the consultancy DJB Strategies, says the service, which is also tied to publishers’ overall search deals, does not deliver the quality traffic that most publishers need to drive their long-term strategies.</p>\n<p>“Google Discover is of zero product importance to Google at all,” he says. “It allows Google to funnel more traffic to publishers as traffic from search declines … Publishers have no choice but to agree or lose their organic search. It also tends to reward clickbaity type content. It pulls in the opposite direction to the kind of relationship publishers want.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, publishers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/25/unjust-threat-murdoch-and-artists-align-in-fight-over-ai-content-scraping\">fighting a wider battle</a> with AI companies seeking to plunder their content to train their large language models.</p>\n<p>The creative industry is intensively lobbying the government to ensure that proposed legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/04/bbc-sky-government-uk-ai-technology-copyright\">does not allow AI firms to use copyright-protected work</a> without permission, a move that would stop the “value being scraped” out of the £125bn sector.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-19\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>Some publishers have struck bilateral licensing deals with AI companies – such as the FT, the German media group Axel Springer, the Guardian and the Nordic publisher Schibsted with the ChatGPT maker OpenAI – while others<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/20/bbc-threatens-legal-action-against-ai-startup-over-content-scraping\"> such as the BBC</a> have taken action against AI companies alleging copyright theft.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/06/existential-crisis-google-use-ai-search-upended-web-publishers-models\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025.</p>\n<p>The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style.</p>\n<p>And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times.</p>\n<p>These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping \"How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy\" was a joke.</p>\n<p>And what was planned as No 10's \"get back in charge week\" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jl43400jo\">not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax</a> on her expensive new house.</p>\n<p>Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team.</p>\n<p>The start of this political season has been wild.</p>\n<p>In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut.</p>\n<p>The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken.</p>\n<p>Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed.</p>\n<p>There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake.</p>\n<p>It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster.</p>\n<p>It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis.</p>\n<p>She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called \"Mr Rules\" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, <i>ahem</i>, flexible attitude to the normal rules.</p>\n<p>She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust.</p>\n<p>For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the \"service of the people\", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels.</p>\n<p>For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, \"it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight\".</p>\n<p>And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world.</p>\n<p>\"There's just the smell test,\" a Labour insider said.</p>\n<p>This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not.</p>\n<p>Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now.</p>\n<p>The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument.</p>\n<p>Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust.</p>\n<p>Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0veg88g7jyo\">Making changes to his ministers.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making.</p>\n<p>Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: \"None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership.\"</p>\n<p>You and I might translate that as: \"The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway.\"</p>\n<p>One insider described it as moving those who were \"a bit awkward, or a bit tired\".</p>\n<p>What those changes add up to depends on who you ask.</p>\n<p>One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle \"is all about immigration\", believing \"Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this\" to solve the small boats issue or \"we're all done for\".</p>\n<p>Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings.</p>\n<p>But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper.</p>\n<p>Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't bet we'll see her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr68vde7nvo\">meeting JD Vance in waders</a> any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that.</p>\n<p>Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry.</p>\n<p>He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical.</p>\n<p>But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves.</p>\n<p>This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition.</p>\n<p>His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the \"time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long\", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck.</p>\n<p>Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: \"I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions.\"</p>\n<p>This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for.</p>\n<p>\"Phase 2\" was meant to be \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". Another bout of political jargon that followed, \"change\", \"renewal\", \"security\", \"fairness\", \"milestones\", \"first steps\", you get the point.</p>\n<p>Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing.</p>\n<p>\"You can see the problem from Mars,\" another party insider says, \"there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything\", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week.</p>\n<p>But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work.</p>\n<p>And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39rk4jlpw7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/about/affiliate-link-policy/\">Learn more.</a></p>\n<h2>Featured in this article</h2>\n<p>Even the best password managers are the vegetables of the internet. We know they’re good for us, but most of us are happier snacking on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/7-steps-to-password-perfection/\">password equivalent of junk food</a>. For nearly a decade, that’s been “123456” and “password”—the two <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/01/worst-passwords-list/\">most commonly used passwords</a> on the web. The problem is, most of us don’t know what makes a good password and aren’t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.</p>\n<p>The safest (if craziest) way to store your passwords is to memorize them all. (Make sure they are long, strong, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/05/password-tips-experts/\">secure</a>!) Just kidding. That might work for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Cooke_(author)\">Memory Grand Master Ed Cooke</a>, but most of us are not capable of such fantastic feats. We need to offload that work to password managers, which offer secure vaults that can serve as a substitute for our memory. The best password manager offers convenience and, more importantly, helps you create better passwords, which makes your online existence less vulnerable to password-based attacks.</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/\">our guide to VPN providers</a> for more ideas on how you can upgrade your security, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-back-up-your-digital-life/\">our guide to backing up your data</a> to make sure you don’t lose anything if the unexpected happens.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Updated September 2025: We've updated our list to include Proton Pass and Zoho Vault.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Why Not Use Your Browser?</p>\n<p>Most web browsers offer at least a rudimentary password manager. (This is where your passwords are stored when Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox ask if you’d like to save a password.) This is better than reusing the same password everywhere, but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/08/browser-password-manager-probably-isnt-enough/\">browser-based password managers are limited</a>. In recent years, Google has improved the password manager built into Chrome, and it's better than the rest, but it's still not as full-featured or widely supported as a dedicated password manager like those below.</p>\n<p>It's not as secure, either. Although your passwords are encrypted in your browser, they're trivially easy to decrypt if someone has access to your PC. Avoid using your browser's password manager if someone else can potentially access your PC.</p>\n<p>WIRED readers have also asked about Apple’s password manager, which syncs through iCloud and has some nice integrations with the Safari web browser—even a dedicated app. There’s nothing wrong with Apple’s system. It doesn’t have some of the nice extras you get with dedicated services, but it handles securing your passwords and syncing them between Apple devices. The main problem is that if you have any non-Apple devices, you won’t be able to sync your passwords to them. All in on Apple? Then this is a viable, free, built-in option worth considering.</p>\n<p>What Are Passkeys?</p>\n<p>A concerted effort to get rid of passwords began roughly two days after the password was invented. Passwords are a pain—you’ll get no argument here—but we don’t see them going away in the foreseeable future. The latest effort to eliminate the password comes from the <a href=\"https://www.passkeycentral.org/introduction-to-passkeys/how-passkeys-work\">FIDO Alliance</a>, an industry group aimed at standardizing authentication methods online. Does this sound a little bit like the infamous <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\">xkcd 927</a>? Yes, yes it does. But thanks to the monopolistic nature of devices, it might work this time.</p>\n<p>Apple supports the FIDO specs and coined the term <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-a-passkey-and-how-to-use-them/\">passkeys</a>, which has caught on. Passkeys are generated cryptographic keys managed by your device (usually your phone). They’re easy to create—you don’t need to do anything, your device handles the details. Your passkeys are stored on your device and protected by either biometrics or PINs. Since passkeys are generated key pairs instead of passwords, there's nothing to remember. If you are familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard\">GPG keys</a>, they're somewhat similar in that there's a public and private key; the website you want to log in to has a public key and sends it to your device. Your device compares that to the private key it has and you're signed in (or not if the keys don't match). While passkeys aren't a radical departure, they're still an improvement by virtue of being a preinstalled tool for people who aren't going to read this article and immediately sign up to use one of the services below. If millions of people suddenly stop using 12345678 as a password, that's a win for security.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the apps we've suggested here can store passkeys, which means you can store your passkeys right alongside your passwords. Our two favorites, Bitwarden and 1Password, can generate, save, store, and sync passkeys. You can even log in to Bitwarden using a passkey, which pretty much eliminates the need for a password at all. Once you have a passkey stored, it will automatically sync to all your devices the same way Bitwarden and 1Password sync your passwords. When you return to that site, your password manager will log you in using the passkey you generated.</p>\n<p>Think of passkeys as credit cards next to the cash (passwords) in your wallet. One day passkeys may work everywhere and there will be no passwords, no password managers. In the mean time we think it's better to stick with a password manager, even if all you're doing with that manager is storing passkeys.</p>\n<p>How a Password Manager Works</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The Pentagon’s website and social media channels were overhauled Friday at President <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>’s behest to reflect the United States Defense Department’s new “Department of War” persona, shifting from Defense.gov to War.gov—a symbolic rebranding that highlights the administration’s preference for projecting strength through the language of war rather than the idiom of defense.</p>\n    <p>Trump on Friday signed an executive order directing the Pentagon to once again be named the so-called Department of War, reviving a name retired after World War II to mark America’s turn to deterrence as the principle bulwark against nuclear annihilation.</p>\n    <p>At an Oval Office ceremony, Trump said the change was about attitude, declaring, “It’s really about winning.”</p>\n    <p>“We won the First World War, we won the Second World War, we won everything before that and in between,” Trump said during the order's signing. “And then we decided to go woke and we changed the name to the Department of Defense.”</p>\n    <p>The order authorizes defense secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials to use titles such as “secretary of war” in official correspondence, though Trump also instructed Hegseth to recommend steps needed to make the change permanent.</p>\n    <p>“We’re going to go on offense, not just on defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct,” Hegseth said during Friday's signing ceremony. “We’re going to raise up warriors, not just defenders.”</p>\n    <p>Every prior name change—from the War Department created by Congress in 1789, to the National Military Establishment in 1947, to the Department of Defense in 1949—came through legislation. Allies in Congress quickly introduced a bill to back Friday's change to the so-called Department of War, but the administration appears to be seeking a workaround anyway, as it has done in the past, whether by invoking <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-makes-broad-use-of-emergency-powersto-advance-policy-priorities-0b2378a4\">sweeping emergency powers</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb136ab7-c14a-4997-bbd7-88210dcc9e33\">withholding congressionally approved foreign aid</a>. Currently, “Department of War” is a “secondary” title after the Department of Defense.</p>\n    <p>Within hours of Trump’s order, Pentagon officials rebranded the department’s social media platforms. The Department of Defense’s official <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DepartmentofWar/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/Deptofwar\">Instagram</a>, and <a href=\"https://x.com/DeptofDefense\">X accounts</a> quietly rolled out the “Department of War” name and seal, adopting labels at odds with its legal identity.</p>\n    <p>As of around 6 pm ET on Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DepartmentofWar/\">new Department of War page</a> still lists all the department's other social channels and its website as using the “Defense” name, as did its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/deptofdefense\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n    <p>How far the rebranding might go is unclear, but any comprehensive effort would saddle taxpayers with costs in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars, as every sign, logo, uniform, computer system, and piece of official paperwork tied to the Pentagon’s identity across the globe would need to be replaced.</p>\n    <p>A prior effort to recommend changes at military installations commemorating the Confederacy carried a projected cost of $39 million and covered only nine bases. The Defense Department’s real property portfolio spans hundreds of thousands of facilities, from major bases to small outposts worldwide.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/department-of-defense-department-of-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He is wearing a dark suit and is imposed over the BBC Verify colours and branding. \"/>\n    <p>As conference season begins for the UK's political parties, Reform UK will be seeking to use its gathering in Birmingham to maintain the momentum it has gathered since the general election.</p>\n    <p>But with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g75we8jk9o\">Nigel Farage claiming that he is ready to be the country's next prime minister,</a> Reform's economic plans are coming under greater scrutiny.</p>\n    <p>BBC Verify has examined what we know - and don't know - about the party's aspirations when it comes to taxation, spending and borrowing.</p>\n    <h2>Net zero</h2>\n    <p>The party has long claimed it will be able to make considerable government savings from entirely scrapping attempts by the government to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>\n    <p>The party's 2024 manifesto  - which it called a \"contract\" - suggested it could save <a href=\"https://assets.nationbuilder.com/reformuk/pages/253/attachments/original/1718625371/Reform_UK_Our_Contract_with_You.pdf?1718625371\">£30bn every year for the next 25 years</a> by ending subsidies related to renewable power generation and emission reductions.</p>\n    <p>Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader, told the BBC on Friday that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Government's independent spending forecaster, now \"agrees\" with those figures.</p>\n    <p>In its most recent <a href=\"https://obr.uk/frs/fiscal-risks-and-sustainability-july-2025/\">Fiscal Risks and Stability Report from July 2025</a> the OBR said the peak annual public sector investment cost of the Government's decarbonisation policy was £16.1bn in 2035, declining to £2.8bn in 2050.</p>\n    <p>It added that the average annual cost over the 25 years would be £9.9bn, or 0.3% per cent of GDP.</p>\n    <p>In that report, the OBR did put the overall \"fiscal cost\" of the net zero transition at an average of £30bn a year - though it attributed around two third of this figure to lost fuel duty receipts, as people choose to switch to electric vehicles, not additional public spending.</p>\n    <p>If people continued to switch to electric vehicles - and the government did not replace fuel duty with a new levy on road users - those fiscal costs would still face a future Reform government, even if they scrapped all net zero public investments.</p>\n    <p>It's also important to bear in mind that the OBR stresses the economic and fiscal costs to the UK from the UK and the world not reaching net zero.</p>\n    <p>Its latest report estimates the fiscal costs from climate-related damage - where global temperatures rise to just below 3°C above pre-industrial levels - could add 2% of GDP to UK primary borrowing (before interest costs] by the early 2070s.</p>\n    <h2>Tax plans</h2>\n    <p>Richard Tice told the BBC on Friday that: \"The manifesto in July 2024 is not appropriate for a manifesto, or a contract, whenever the next general election is.\"</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, that document is the most comprehensive and recent guide to the economic aspirations of the party - and the leadership have indicated that parts of it still stand.</p>\n    <p>The manifesto pledged considerable tax cuts to individuals and businesses.</p>\n    <p>The party said it would, among other things, lift the income tax starting threshold to £20,000 (from its current level of £12,570) and take 7 million people out of paying income tax.</p>\n    <p>It said its personal tax pledges would add up to an estimated cost of £70bn a year.</p>\n    <p>Reform also said it would abolish business rates, which are charged on most non-residential premises by councils.</p>\n    <p>It put an estimated cost of £18bn a year on its various proposed tax cuts on businesses.</p>\n    <p>That total £88bn a year of tax cuts would have been almost double the £45bn a year of tax cuts in Liz Truss's 2022 mini budget.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5475/live/fd074f10-8a65-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.png.webp\" alt=\"A BBC graphic showing Reform's manifesto costings. \"/>\n    <p>As well as cutting taxes, Reform's manifesto also said it would considerably increase spending, including on the NHS, defence, policing and prisons.</p>\n    <p>It said its health pledges would cost £17bn a year and its defence pledges £14bn a year and total spending pledges would add up to £53bn a year.</p>\n    <p>Since the election, Reform has pledged to deport some 600,000 unauthorised migrants over the next Parliament, which it has claimed would cost £10bn but save £17bn - so delivering a net saving of £7bn over the Parliament.</p>\n    <p>We don't have a detailed document from Reform, breaking down these costs and where these savings would be made, so it's not possible to verify this.</p>\n    <p>But these costings would, in any case, be subject to very high uncertainty.

    "body": "<p>Angela Rayner has resigned as deputy prime minister, housing secretary and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, after admitting <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c0lk8ye1979t\">she underpaid tax after buying a flat in Hove</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is her resignation letter in full, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's response and a letter from Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial ethics, in which he sets out that Rayner breached the ministerial code.</p>\n<h2>Rayner's resignation letter</h2>\n<p>Dear Keir,</p>\n<p>Thank you for the personal and public support you have shown me in recent days. As you know, on Wednesday I referred myself to your Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to conduct a thorough investigation into my personal financial circumstances after I became aware that it is likely I inadvertently paid the incorrect rate for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).</p>\n<p>I have always taken my responsibilities as Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as a Member of Parliament with the utmost seriousness. I have long believed that people who serve the British public in government must always observe the highest standards, and while the Independent Adviser has concluded that I acted in good faith and with honesty and integrity throughout, I accept that I did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.</p>\n<p>I deeply regret my decision to not seek additional specialist tax advice given both my position as Housing Secretary and my complex family arrangements. I take full responsibility for this error. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount.</p>\n<p>I must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family. While I rightly expect proper scrutiny on me and my life, my family did not choose to have their private lives interrogated and exposed so publicly. I have been clear throughout this process that my priority has, and always will be, protecting my children and the strain I am putting them under through staying in post has become unbearable.</p>\n<p>Given the findings, and the impact on my family, I have therefore decided to resign as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>\n<p>For a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport to serve as the highest level of government has been the honour of my life. The challenges of government are nothing compared to the challenge of putting food on the table and getting a roof over our head when I brought up kids working as a home help. Too many people face the same across our country.</p>\n<p>I've always known that politics changes lives because it changed mine. The last Labour government gave me the tools I needed to build a better life for me and my young son, and that's why I've been working relentlessly from day one in government to do the same for the next generation. Every day I had in office, I worked to serve working class communities like the one that I grew up in, which are too often overlooked by those in power. I am proud that in every decision I made, I did it for them. I would never have become Deputy Prime Minister if not for the decisions taken by the last Labour Government, giving me a council house to support me, Sure Start to help raise my kids, and the security of a minimum wage - and I can only hope that the changes I made in government will have the same impact for young girls growing up on council estates like I did.</p>\n<p>Through my Employment Rights Bill people across the country will receive the biggest uplift in workers' rights in a generation. This landmark legislation will be game changing for millions of people stuck in insecure and low-paid work, giving them the dignity and security they don't just need but also deserve. I am and will remain deeply proud of that legacy. I am so proud to have worked alongside the trade union movement, who have given me everything, to deliver that.</p>\n<p>Our Renters' Rights Bill will finally ban the oppressive rule of no-fault evictions and will reset the balance between renters and landlords through ground breaking protection for renters. Everyone deserves to live in a safe and decent home, and I know this legislation will deliver that for millions of people across the country.</p>\n<p>The Planning and Infrastructure Bill will also be instrumental in getting the homes so many people across this country need built, and I am so proud that at the Spending Review we announced the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation with the overwhelming amount of this going to genuinely social rent homes.</p>\n<p>And last week, I introduced the English Devolution Bill to Parliament. The largest single package of devolution from any Westminster government to local people across England. This landmark legislation will permanently change the balance of power, giving true control to those with skin in game. We delivered an Elections Strategy which will mean 16 and 17 year olds getting the vote for the first time, as well as ambitious plans to ensure the most marginalised communities are registered to vote. We took steps to stabilise the broken foundations of local government and deliver the first genuinely fair funding review and the first multi-year settlement for a decade.</p>\n<p>My department, through my excellent team of Ministers, has also provided the largest ever investment in homelessness prevention services to local authorities, to get Britain back on track to ending homelessness for good. We've worked relentlessly to bring an end to the building safety crisis and developed new measures to get peoples' homes fixed quicker and hold rogue freeholders to account. We've also worked to boost community cohesion, tackle hate crime and reset the relationship with faith communities.</p>\n<p>I have been lucky to work alongside the most talented group of Ministers who worked with dedication to deliver for working people. I thank Matthew Pennycook, Jim McMahon, Alex Norris, Wajid Khan and Sharon Taylor. I too am grateful to my brilliant parliamentary team, Harpreet Uppal, Mark Ferguson, and Gen Kitchen.</p>\n<p>For me, being in office is the chance to change the lives of the people I grew up alongside. I will do whatever I can to continue doing so.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your leadership and for your friendship. I will continue to serve you, our country and the party and movement I love in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Rt. Hon. Angela Rayner MP Representing Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Droylsden and Dukinfield Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government</p>\n<h2>Sir Keir's reply to Rayner</h2>\n<p>Dear Angela,</p>\n<p>Thank you for informing me of your decision to resign from the Government. I am very sad that your time as Deputy prime Minister, Secretary of State and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party has ended in this way.</p>\n<p>As you know we acted in accordance with the strengthened system relating to ministerial conduct that we put in place on coming into Government. You were right to refer yourself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards and right to act on his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Although I believe you have reached the right decision, it is a decision which I know is very painful for you. You have given your all to making the Labour Government a success and you have been a central part of our plan to make Britain fairer for working families. Your work at MHCLG to help build the homes that Britain needs has been hugely important and your work to create more fairness in the workplace through the Employment Rights Bill represents a very significant achievement that will change the lives of millions of people.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I am very sad to be losing you from the Government. You have been a trusted colleague and a true friend for many years. I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievement in politics. I know that many people of all political persuasions admire that someone as talented as you is the living embodiment of social mobility.</p>\n<p>Even though you won't be part of the Government, you will remain a major figure in our party. I know that you will continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about.</p>\n<p>My very best wishes, and with real sadness,</p>\n<p>Keir</p>\n<h2>Ethics adviser's letter to PM on Rayner's conduct</h2>\n<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>\n<p>Following a self-referral by The Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 3 September 2025, I have undertaken an examination of the circumstances and facts connected to recent allegations about Ms Rayner's property ownership and tax affairs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyn051990o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I remember, at 10, my mum being suicidal and me sleeping like a dog on the end of her bed, just to try and stay next to her so she didn't do any harm to herself,\" Rayner said.</p>\n    <p>She has also recalled going to her grandmother's flat on Sundays, so the family could take it in turns to have a bath there. Hot water was too expensive for them to use at home.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0b5/live/55dde2b0-8a35-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner speaks at a general election campaign event in Manchester on 7 November 2019. She holds her hands out in front of a red screen.\"/>\n    <p>Rayner has often spoken about being told she would \"never amount to anything\", after she left school without any qualifications.</p>\n    <p>But after having her first child at 16, Rayner studied part-time at college, learning British sign language and gaining a vocational qualification in social care.</p>\n    <p>She spent a number of years as a care worker in Stockport, mainly looking after elderly people in their own homes, while also rising quickly through the ranks of the union, Unison.</p>\n    <p>She has described herself as \"mouthy\", someone who would \"take no messing from management\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c7a/live/27e0a200-8a38-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Alamy Angela Rayner with members of Unison and protesters from Save Our Ambulance Service on their way to the Department of Health. They hold a purple sign reading Unison.\"/>\n    <p>In her 20s, she became a full-time union official and eventually, after battles over working conditions and zero-hour contracts, rose to the most senior elected role in Unison in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>It was at Unison she met Mark Rayner, a fellow union official whom she married in 2010 and divorced in 2023. The couple went on to have two sons, one of whom was born so prematurely he is registered blind and has special educational needs.</p>\n    <p>At the age of 37, the mum-of-three became a grandmother, sparking the nickname \"Grangela\".</p>\n    <p>She credits the trade union movement with encouraging her to enter politics and taking her from - in her own words - \"the girl on a council estate\" to \"a woman who feels like she can conquer the world\".</p>\n    <p>Those ambitions started to be realised in 2015, when she was elected as the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne - a seat not far from her hometown. She later said she had only stood to make the point that \"people like me can't get elected\" and had \"accidentally\" won the seat.</p>\n    <h2>The Prescott role</h2>\n    <p>Rayner rose quickly in Westminster, taking up the women and equalities, and education briefs in the shadow cabinet of former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n    <p>When Corbyn stood down in 2020, following Labour's worst general election result since 1935, Rayner did not run for the leadership, and backed her ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second to Sir Keir.</p>\n    <p>Instead, Rayner stood for the deputy leadership and won election to that post comfortably - going on to be a central figure in Sir Keir's bid to remake the party.</p>\n    <p>But relations between Sir Keir and Rayner have sometimes been tense. After Labour lost control of eight English councils and lost the seat of Hartlepool in a parliamentary by-election in May 2021, the deputy leader was removed from her post as party chairwoman.</p>\n    <p>She pushed back and was appointed shadow first secretary of state among other titles.</p>\n    <p>By that point, Rayner had a strong support base and a powerful role likened to that of John Prescott, who was seen as a political bridge between the working class and the New Labour project during Tony Blair's premiership.</p>\n    <p>Rayner heavily leaned into that role and tried to use it to her party's advantage in the years before Labour's general election win in 2024.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58ff/live/0a856a50-8a39-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chairwoman of the Labour Party visit Seaton Carew seafront on 1 May 2021 in Seaton Carew.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/department-of-homeland-security/\">DHS</a>) this month quietly awarded a $30,000 no-bid contract for sniper and combat training to a Virginia firm run by Dan LaLota, the brother of US representative Nick LaLota, a second-term Republican from New York.</p>\n    <p>Finalized on September 2, the award went to Target Down Group of Mechanicsville, Virginia, which will provide a five-day precision fire and observation course for the Homeland Security Investigations’ Special Response Team (SRT) sniper program. The course, intended to help inform new DHS procedures, is “aimed at equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively conduct law enforcement sniper operations in high-risk environments,” per records reviewed by WIRED.</p>\n    <p>The SRT functions as the agency’s version of a SWAT team, composed of special agents with advanced tactical training for situations deemed too dangerous for standard personnel. SRT members wear military-style camouflage and helmets, carry a range of weapons, and train in breaching, sniper tactics, and close-quarters combat.</p>\n    <p>According to federal procurement records, the SRT contract was issued on a sole-source basis, with officials citing Target Down Group’s prior work with Homeland Security Investigations as well as its pre-clearance to conduct live-fire exercises at a law enforcement facility in Arizona.</p>\n    <p>Congressman LaLota, who served on the House Homeland Security Committee in the previous session, could not be reached for comment. Calls to his New York and Washington, DC, offices went unanswered Thursday.</p>\n    <p>DHS did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n    <p>Reached by phone, Dan LaLota said his firm’s deal with ICE has nothing to do with his brother’s position in Congress. “I’m not a new guy on the block,” he tells WIRED, adding there’s only a few people qualified to provide the training DHS requested. “To say my company would be the only one eligible would not be unsound.”</p>\n    <p>LaLota added he could not speak on ICE’s behalf and declined to discuss details of his company’s work, calling the questions an invasion of privacy while directing reporters to his firm’s website for information about its staff and expertise.</p>\n    <p>Target Down Group’s website lists Dan LaLota, a retired Marine sniper, as the company’s president. According to his brother’s <a href=\"https://www.nicklalota.com/about-nick\">congressional biography</a>, LaLota served two decades in the Marine Corps, including tours with Force Reconnaissance and Marine Special Operations Command, earning a Bronze Star with Valor for actions in Fallujah, Iraq. LaLota told WIRED he also has seven years as a scout sniper instructor.</p>\n    <p>Federal procurement records list Target Down Group as a Virginia company; however, state records show the firm is not legally authorized to operate as a Virginia corporation at this time, having been terminated in November 2024 after failing to meet yearly filing and fee requirements with the state’s corporate registry. Nevertheless, the company was registered separately in Florida as of July. (Asked about the discrepancy, Target Down Group CEO Christopher Allison acknowledged the inquiry but did not provide comment.)</p>\n    <p>Federal acquisition rules allow sole-source contracts under certain conditions, effectively bypassing the competitive bidding process often required for federal awards. In a <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26083599/151-ssj-redact-redacted.pdf\">redacted justification memo</a>, DHS said Target Down Group was the only vendor able to deliver the training, citing a tight operational schedule as well as the firm’s prior work with its sniper program and established ties to Arizona police, some of whom will participate in the exercise.</p>\n    <p>LaLota declined to discuss any previous work for the government. “I’m not at liberty to discuss what business I have with a stranger like yourself. I hope you can understand that,” he said.</p>\n    <p>In June, NBC News <a href=\"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/ice-to-send-tactical-units-to-multiple-cities-including-philly-sources-say/4207515/\">reported</a> that SRT units were preparing to deploy to several Democratic-led cities, including Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, and New York. The planned deployments followed immigration raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/\">protests</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/non-lethal-weapons-la-protests/\">clashes with law enforcement</a>. Philadelphia officials told NBC they had received no notice of incoming ICE forces.</p>\n    <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly defended sending federal law enforcement and National Guard troops into blue strongholds by claiming they are plagued by “runaway crime,” a description critics call exaggerated and politically driven. In cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, local and state officials have resisted the deployments, arguing they are motivated by politics, not public safety.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/us-congressmans-brother-lands-no-bid-contract-to-train-dhs-snipers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On 3 October 2021, Reform UK held its first conference - a modest one-day get-together in Manchester - only a short distance from the much larger Conservative Party gathering, taking place nearby at the city's Convention Complex at the same time.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At the Reform event, only a few hundred activists were present in the function room - and Nigel Farage, not yet party leader, was reportedly not among them. Reform was polling around 3% and had won just two councillors in that May's local elections.</p>\n<p>What a difference four years makes.</p>\n<p>Reform's annual conference takes place this weekend in Birmingham, with 5,500 tickets reportedly already sold. It is thought that one in five of the nation's lobbyists will be there too. The party has now been ahead in the polls for five months.</p>\n<p>Never before has a party other than Conservative or Labour been ahead in the polls for so long. Indeed, since the party's success in English local elections in May, it has consistently been averaging 30% to 31%, enough to put it well ahead of all its rivals.</p>\n<p>Recent attempts by YouGov and More in Common to estimate what the party's support might mean in terms of MPs suggest that if an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority. At the moment, Nigel Farage - now firmly in place as Reform's leader - appears potentially on course to become the UK's next prime minister.</p>\n<p>The question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?</p>\n<p>The next general election could be almost four years away. Much could happen between now and then. A year into the last parliament the Conservatives were narrowly ahead in the polls – only to crash to a heavy defeat in last summer's election.</p>\n<p>But what could make a difference – one way or the other – to Reform's prospects? Analysis of who is - and who is not - backing the party, and why, provides us with vital clues.</p>\n<p>So too does an understanding of the broader UK political landscape, one in which a fragmentation of the vote away from the main parties is offering Reform an unprecedented opportunity.</p>\n<h2>A plague on both their houses?</h2>\n<p>Support for Reform might be thought to be simply a protest vote by an electorate fed up with slow growth, an ailing health service, and high levels of immigration. If so, the party's popularity would seem likely to wane should the country's prospects look brighter in four years.</p>\n<p>Dissatisfaction with the state of the country certainly underpins support for Reform. For example, according to Ipsos, 68% of voters feel that the economy will get worse over the next year, up from 43% at the time of last year's election and as high as it has ever been a year into a new Parliament. Among those whose current party preference is Reform, a remarkable 89% are pessimistic about the prospects for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the most recent British Social Attitudes survey, conducted last autumn, showed that a record 59% are dissatisfied with the NHS. Among those who voted Reform last year, the figure is even higher – 69%.</p>\n<p>Most voters think that immigration is too high. An Opinium poll in August found that 71% feel that way. But nearly everyone who is now backing Reform (97%) expresses that view.</p>\n<p>Reform supporters have little confidence in the ability of either Labour's leader, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, or the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to address these issues. Most lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to handle the economy, the NHS, and immigration. However, at the same time, on balance their judgement of Badenoch's abilities is a negative one too.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Reform supporters have even less confidence than Conservative supporters in Sir Keir's abilities. At the same time, Reform supporters have less confidence than Labour supporters in Badenoch's capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, 58% of Conservatives lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to turn the economy around – well short of the 76% of Reform supporters who express that view. Meanwhile, 40% of Labour supporters doubt that Badenoch can tackle the economy, less than the 47% figure among Reform supporters.</p>\n<h2>A powerful magnet</h2>\n<p>Reform supporters seem to have lost faith in the ability of either of Britain's two traditional governing parties to address the country's most pressing problems.</p>\n<p>In contrast, they do have confidence in Farage. This is especially so for immigration, but he also scores well on the economy and the NHS.</p>\n<p>Among those currently backing Reform, 84% approve of the job Farage is doing – far higher than the equivalent figure for Sir Keir among Labour supporters (62%) or Badenoch (46%) among Conservatives.</p>\n<p>While Farage is not so widely admired in the wider population, his ratings among voters in general still compare favourably with those of his rivals.</p>\n<p>In Opinium's most recent poll, for example, rather more say they disapprove (40%) than approve (30%) of how Farage is handling his job as Reform leader. But that still means that more approve of the job he is doing than approve of Sir Keir (21%) or Badenoch (16%).</p>\n<p>The Reform leader is proving a powerful magnet that is attracting discontented voters into his party's camp.</p>\n<p>The party's future prospects seemingly rest heavily on Farage remaining its leader. The party might struggle to keep its support if Farage departed the political scene. At the same time, voters might drift away if the country's prospects improve under Labour or if Badenoch can persuade them that she and her party have better solutions than Farage.</p>\n<h2>The Brexit factor</h2>\n<p>Politicians do not talk much about Brexit these days. Yet, Brexit is a major fault line that sharply distinguishes those who do and do not support Reform. The party's support stands at no less than 53% among those who voted Leave in 2016. In contrast, just 11% of those who backed Remain are to be found in the ranks of current Reform supporters.</p>\n<p>But to misquote a former prime minister, Brexit means more than Brexit. Those who voted Leave in 2016 have distinctive views on a range of so-called cultural issues.</p>\n<p>They are especially concerned about immigration, they are doubtful about many equalities policies, and they are more inclined to be sceptical about climate change.</p>\n<p>These views are widely prevalent among those currently inclined to vote for Reform but are often out of kilter with the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>According to the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 81% of those who voted Reform last year believe that migrants have undermined rather than enriched the country's culture. Equally 73% feel that migrants have been bad for the country's economy. These figures are very different from those among voters in general, just 31% of whom believe that migration has undermined Britain's culture, and only 32% feel it has been bad for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 53% of Reform voters believe that attempts to give equal opportunities for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals have \"gone too far\". Some 49% say the same of equal opportunities for black and Asian people, while 71% express that view in the case of transgender people. The equivalent figures among the general public are 33%, 18% and 50% respectively.</p>\n<p>Only 33% of Reform voters believe that climate change is being caused mainly by human activity, far fewer than the 54% figure among the public in general. As many as 25% state that the climate is largely changing as a result of natural processes, a view shared by just 8% of all voters. Reform voters are less supportive than other voters of virtually any measure designed to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Opposition to immigration, equal opportunities policies, and climate change measures feature prominently in Reform's campaigning – which often cites spending on these issues as alleged examples of government waste. Indeed, Reform voters are noticeably less keen on government spending too. Only one in four (25%) believe taxes should be increased in order to spend more on \"health, education and social benefits\", much lower than the 46% of all voters who take that view.</p>\n<p>The party is singing a tune that is widely popular among the many Brexiteers who have been recruited into the ranks of its supporters.</p>\n<p>Doing so has enabled the party to capture much of the coalition of Leave voters that gave Boris Johnson his mandate in 2019 to deliver Brexit. The Conservatives lost one in four of their 2019 supporters to Reform at the last election - and now, on top of that, Badenoch's party has lost another three in 10 of those who were still loyal to the Conservatives last year. In total, that means half of those who voted for Johnson in 2019 are now backing Farage.</p>\n<p>Consequently, support for the Conservatives among 2016 Leave voters (23%) is only a little higher now than among Remain supporters (14%). In 2019, 75% of Leave voters (and just 20% of Remainers) backed Johnson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy853rj2kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The same judge had ruled in favor of US prosecutors nearly a year ago, finding that Google built and maintained an illegal monopoly with its namesake search engine.</p>\n<p>Groups critical of Google’s dominance in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet\">internet</a> search and online <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/advertising\">advertising</a> industry are furious. They contend the judge missed an opportunity to enact meaningful change in an industry that has suffocated under the crushing weight of its heaviest player. Tech industry groups and investors, by contrast, are thrilled. Shares in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet\">Alphabet</a>, Google’s parent company, have risen 9% since Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Judge Amit Mehta did order Google to share data from its search engine with its rivals. He also enjoined the company from entering or maintaining exclusive contracts relating to the distribution of its products including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chrome\">Chrome</a>, Google Assistant and the Gemini app. That penalty will not, however, prevent it from paying distributors such as Apple and Mozilla, which use Google as the default search engine for their respective browsers. Google faces a separate hearing later this year on its monopoly over online advertising technology.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice celebrated the ruling in a Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google\">press release</a> that called Mehta’s proposed remedies “significant”.</p>\n<p>“The court’s ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade,” the announcement reads.</p>\n<p>It’s not enough, say free market advocates.</p>\n<h2>Critics say judge handed Google a lenient win</h2>\n<p>Mehta’s decision resulted in an immediate wave of backlash from big tech critics who have been closely following the antitrust case for years. Many of these thinktanks and advocacy groups had <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/how-us-history-and-googles-own-behavior-justifies-a-breakup-to-restore-competition-in-search/\">long called</a> for Google to be broken up for its monopolistic tactics, arguing that forceful action was needed to restore meaningful competition.</p>\n<p>Instead of opening up the online search industry, however, critics of the ruling allege that it will now retrench Google’s dominance while setting a precedent that big tech need not fear serious consequences for breaking the law.</p>\n<p>“Google for years has wielded its vast power over all layers of the digital economy to crush competitors, halt innovation and rob Americans of their right to read, watch and buy what they want without being manipulated by one of the most powerful corporations in human history,” Barry Lynn, executive director at the Open Markets Institute thinktank, said. “Judge Mehta’s order that Google share search data with competitors and cease entering into exclusive contracts does nothing to right those wrongs. Instead, it lets Google and every other monopolist know that even the most egregious violation of law will be met with a slap on the wrist.”</p>\n<p>Some groups and experts took issue with how Mehta’s ruling that Google had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/google-loses-antitrust-lawsuit\">illegally maintained a monopoly</a> could result in the more lenient decision handed down this week.</p>\n<p>“You don’t find someone guilty of robbing a bank and then sentence him to writing a thank you note for the loot,” said Nidhi Hegde, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project non-profit.</p>\n<p>Several tech leaders, including the CEOs of Yelp, search engine DuckDuckGo and Epic Games, additionally condemned the decision for failing to adequately level the playing field for competitors. Yelp and Epic Games have both sued Google over antitrust issues, while DuckDuckGo’s CEO testified in the government’s antitrust trial against the search giant.</p>\n<p>“It’s like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, posted on X in yet another use of a bank robbing analogy.</p>\n<p>Democratic lawmakers who have urged for stronger regulations on big tech similarly denounced the ruling, in some cases calling for the justice department to appeal the decision.</p>\n<p>“The court previously ruled that Google’s search business is an illegal monopoly, but now the judge’s remedies fail to hold Google accountable for breaking the law,” the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said in <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-on-court-ruling-to-address-googles-illegal-search-monopoly\">a statement</a>. “Instead of restoring competition and ending Google’s dominance, this ruling is a slap on the wrist for unlawful behavior that warranted the breakup of this tech giant.”</p>\n<p>The chairs of the Monopoly Busters caucus – US representatives Chris Deluzio, Pramila Jayapal, Pat Ryan and Angie Craig – also issued a statement calling the decision a “slap on the wrist” and alleging it undermines bipartisan efforts to rein in tech monopolies.</p>\n<p>“In practice, this ruling allows Google to stay a monopoly. Despite finding Google guilty of search monopolization, the court is allowing the company to retain Chrome and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/android\">Android</a>, key tools that Google uses to dominate the market,” the caucus said.</p>\n<p>The decision also drew the ire of the human rights group Amnesty International, which said that Google’s business model was built on <strong>“</strong>pervasive surveillance” and that Chrome was an important tool used for harvesting the personal data of Google users.</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-20\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n<p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n<p>“Forcing Google to break up its search business and sell Chrome could have marked a first step toward a digital world that respects our rights,” said Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/03/google-monopoly-case-ruling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Farage condemned as 'Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant' by ranking Democrat on House judiciary committee</p>\n<p>Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House judiciary committee, says they do have free speech in the UK. He says Keir Starmer has not shut down GB News, even though Farage has a show on that station in which he criticises the government and calls for bans on peaceful protests.</p>\n<p>He says Farage is able to parrot “Putin’s absurd talking points” on TV. He goes on:</p>\n<p>For a man who fancies himself to some kind of a free speech martyr, Mr Farage seems most at home with the autocrats and dictators of the world who are crushing freedom on earth.</p>\n<p>He says Farage wants to get rid of the Online Safety Act. But if he wants to do that, he should be advancing those arguments in the UK parliament, which is meeting today, Raskin says.</p>\n<p>He goes on:</p>\n<p>To the people of the UK who think this Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant will protect freedom in your country, come over to America and see what Trump and Mega are doing to destroy our freedom, kidnap college students off the street, ban books from our libraries, militarise our police and unleash them against our communities, take over our universities … You might think twice before you let Mr Farage “make Britain great again”.</p>\n<p>Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has been accused of being a “Putin-loving, free speech impostor and Trump sycophant” by a leading Democrat congressman in a committee hearing on Capitol Hill. (See 3.39pm.) And Labour has criticised Farage for suggesting that Donald Trump should use the threat of higher tariffs on the UK to secure exemptions for US firms from the Online Safety Act. (See 6.18pm.)</p>\n<p>For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the blog.</p>\n<p>Labour revives claim that Farage urging Trump to use tariff threat against UK to win concessions for tech firms</p>\n<p>Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has rejected suggestions that he has been urging Donald Trump to use the threat of sanctions to get US companies exempted from the Online Safety Act.</p>\n<p>But he was quite careful about the words he used. In an interview with Sky News, when the reporter asked about Farage urging Trump to “sanction countries” (the reporter was referring to tariffs), Farage replied: “I have not used that word in any way.” (See 3.11pm.) Later he told the House judiciary committee: “I’ve not suggested sanctions, at all in any way.” (See 5.17pm.)</p>\n<p>But sanctions are not the same as tariffs. (Rather, the word ‘sanction’ can be used generally, to mean a punitive measure, but it also has an explicit meaning in international law.) Farage may not have been proposing sanctions in the narrow sense of the word, but he was suggesting that the US might use tariff threats as leverage.</p>\n<p>In his Sky interview, Farage said:</p>\n<p>I’ve said that I hope that American political parties, leaders and businesses have a frank conversation with the British government and say, if you don’t sort this out, it’s going to have serious trade implications for both of us.</p>\n<p>And Harry Cole from the Sun has posted this on social media defending his Sun story saying Farage was urging Trump to use the tariff threat.</p>\n<p>Farage will also recommend the Committee “Declare as U.S. policy that foreign speech restrictions have no effect on Americans acting in the United States and on U.S.-hosted services even if accessed abroad, and instruct the Executive to defend this position in diplomacy and trade fora.”</p>\n<p>Commenting on Farage’s Sky interview, Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said:</p>\n<p>Jetting off to another country and hyping up the prospect of the UK’s trade with our closest allies being hit is about as anti-British as you can get. Labour negotiated a deal with the US that secured tens of thousands of jobs and Farage is advocating putting that at risk.</p>\n<p>This just shows the risk Farage’s Reform pose if they ever got close to power. He waves our flag, but he represents anything but the best interests of the British people. And it’s working people who would be left to pay the price.</p>\n<p>While Farage’s “Talk Britain Down” tour ramps up a gear, this Labour government is delivering the second phase of our Plan for Change, making sure we get more money back into working people’s pockets as quickly as possible and bring about the national renewal Britain needs.</p>\n<p>UK may not have 'drawn line in right place' when it applies ECHR, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood tells peers</p>\n<p>At another committee hearing earlier today, Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretarty, said she was not sure the UK has “the line in the right place” in the way it applies the European convention on human rights.</p>\n<p>Giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee, Mahmood ruled out withdrawing from the ECHR. She said:</p>\n<p>If you withdraw, you’re in a club that currently has two members [Russia and Belarus], and then we would be a third. The position of our government is the direct opposite of that.</p>\n<p>But she confirmed that the government is committed to changing the way article 9 – the right to family life – is applied in the UK. She said:</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/03/farage-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-news-updates-uk-politics-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She smiles at the camera while wearing a hi-vis jacket, gloves, protection googles and a hard hat. The CEO of Berkeley Group, Rob Perrinns, watches on smiling. He is also wearing a hi-vis vest.\"/>\n    <p>It is going to be a long 12 weeks, critical to the chancellor, the government and the nation's economy.</p>\n    <p>Rachel Reeves chose to talk to me at a Birmingham housebuilding development to launch the Budget process as she tried her hand at some bricklaying.</p>\n    <p>However, the obligatory hard hat might come in rather handy away from the site as the chancellor wanted to get across that the point of her Budget would not just be to \"raise enough money\" for public services - which is code for tax rises.</p>\n    <p>She wants to be known as a reforming chancellor who made much-needed structural reforms to how the tax system operates, in a bid to boost economic productivity and growth to improve living standards.</p>\n    <p>First and foremost, that requires a reassertion that she is in charge of this process.</p>\n    <p>\"I will make the decisions,\" she said, \"in lockstep\" with Number 10.</p>\n    <p>That statement is in a week of economist transfers where the Treasury has become something of a feeder club to Number 10.</p>\n    <p>Off the junior ministers' bench has been Darren Jones, Reeves' former deputy, who has taken up a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce93k7l0zpro\">newly-created role as Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister</a>. </p>\n    <p>Football analogies aside, the immediate challenge facing Reeves is the size of the gap in the public finances.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor chose to dismiss the suggestion of a \"£50bn black hole\", and talk of a need for a visit to the International Monetary Fund to request a bailout.</p>\n    <p>She also savaged some of the Budget speculation over tax rises on property, banks and pensions as not just \"wrong\" but \"irresponsible\".</p>\n    <p>The Treasury says it has not been flying kites over the summer.</p>\n    <p>I also put to her the very interesting words of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in July, on levelling with the public that \"promises made are constantly not kept\" on tax and spending.</p>\n    <p>There was the mildest air of annoyance with the forecaster whose analyses are so critical to the Budget process.</p>\n    <p>\"The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce four forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy,\" she replied.</p>\n    <p>While the chancellor has been a massive supporter of the OBR, granting it more independence, this nerdy point could reflect some looming tension over its assessment of her economic policies.</p>\n    <p>Expect some considerable haggling with the OBR from the freshly recruited array of high-powered Downing Street economists.</p>\n    <p>Reeves will stick to her fiscal rules around borrowing, she says.</p>\n    <p>But there will be pressure from her backbenchers to fudge them.</p>\n    <p>What spending reductions could be on the cards? Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.</p>\n    <p>She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8%, down.</p>\n    <p>Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.</p>\n    <p>Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.</p>\n    <p>She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics.</p>\n    <p>It's going to be a rough ride to 26 November.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

JLR told its parent company that it was “working at pace to resolve global IT issues impacting our business”.</p>\n    <p>One cybersecurity specialist said the speed of the shutdown underlined the seriousness of the threat facing JLR’s operations.</p>\n    <p>“JLR’s decision to proactively shut down global manufacturing suggests this attack may have been targeting their operational systems, not just customer data,” said Oakley Cox, a director at the UK cybersecurity firm Darktrace. “The speed of their response is telling – you don’t typically halt production across multiple sites unless there’s genuine concern about operational impact.”</p>\n    <p>JLR did not give more details about who was behind the cyber incident, when it was discovered or how long it would take to recover from it.</p>\n    <p>The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre was contacted for comment.</p>\n    <p>In April, Marks &amp; Spencer revealed it had been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/22/marks-and-spencer-apologises-cyber-incident-contactless-payments-online-orders\">victim of a devastating cyber-attack</a> which resulted in the closure of its online store for almost seven weeks and cost it hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>\n    <p>The Co-op was attacked in the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system. Both had been targeted by ransomware, which locks up a victim’s computer files.</p>\n    <p>JLR has given no indication that its incident also involves such malware, but in a separate and unconfirmed incident in March, the Hellcat ransomware group claimed it had <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/ransomware-group-claims-attacks-on-ascom-jaguar-land-rover/amp/\">extracted data from JLR’s systems</a>. JLR has been contacted for comment about the Hellcat claim.</p>\n    <p>In May, the luxury retailer Harrods said that it had been targeted, and restricted internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access to its system.

Autocar reported that JLR dealers had been unable to register cars with the new plate.</p>\n    <p>JLR also said in July that it had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/18/jaguar-land-rover-delays-launch-range-rover-electric\">delay the planned launches</a> of its new electric Range Rover and electric Jaguar models until 2026, after initially aiming for late 2025.

For that they’ve been subject to the brunt of our zeitgeist’s wrath in the years since.</p>\n    <p>Resentful boomers began the anti-millennial crusade. That’s to be expected; older people griping about the kids is nothing new, but rather a rite of passage that signifies a healthy ecosystem within the age groups. Hell, even gen X occasionally joins in on the action.</p>\n    <p>But now millennials face a brand-new beast of an enemy: their younger, meaner and far more tech-literate younger sibling, generation Z.</p>\n    <p>It’s not hard to find anti-millennial sentiments on practically every mainstream social media site out there – zoomers are the new apex predator of the internet after all – even coining an antonym custom-fit for millennial uncoolness: cheugy.</p>\n    <p>I was born at the tail-end of 1997, making me either the most fresh-faced millennial or the oldest gen Z hag, depending on who you ask. I’m otherwise known as a “zillennial”.</p>\n    <p>So as a generational fence-sitter with a foot in both camps, I reckon that I’m an excellent candidate to unravel this sibling rivalry.</p>\n    <p>First, let’s point out the obvious: I’m sorry, dear millennials, but you are pretty easy to make fun of. From your bygone affinity for putting moustaches on literally everything, inventing stupid words like “doggo” and letting BuzzFeed control the culture for a couple of years, you really have a lot to answer for.</p>\n    <p>I’ll be the first to admit I’ve partaken in bullying millennials but I’ve begun to hold back because – let’s face it – it’s pretty mean, and it’s not as though zoomers are that much cooler. Sure, they talk a big game but I don’t think the generation that made Labubus, JoJo Siwa and broccoli haircuts popular has a solid leg to stand on.</p>\n    <p>Clearly, there is a cringe goldmine to be found in both generations. So why is it that it’s mostly millennials taking the heat?</p>\n    <p>The truth is, millennials (for the most part) take cringe in their stride. Gen Z, on the other hand, is deeply terrified of being perceived as anything other than a specific type of curated cool.</p>\n    <p>The poet and author <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMRuChLhuJF/\">Ocean Vuong spoke to the ABC</a> in July about this phenomenon, saying “cringe culture” is holding young people back from enjoying life and pursuing what they want, whether related to their career, relationships or hobbies.</p>\n    <p>Both generations share the dismal reality of never owning a home (without parental assistance) and being young under an ever-increasing threat of climate devastation. But while millennials unabashedly cultivated modern nerd culture and weren’t afraid to be seen as sincere online and IRL, gen Z find themselves weighed down by the heavy shackles of irony culture.</p>\n    <p>To be perceived as earnest is a fate worse than death for the self-conscious, aura-farming zoomer, which leads them to lash out against those who do not follow the rules of their anti-cringe world.</p>\n    <p>Millennials grew up quite literally alongside the internet, complete with awkward phases, while zoomers have never known a world devoid of near-constant and hyper-polished social monitoring.</p>\n    <p>The digital landscape once ruled by millennials was “awesome”. Think back to those days when Photoshopped edits of cats in space, AutoTuned news reports and chaotically creative seven-second Vines were commonplace.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, zoomers inherited AI slop, fascist influencers and megalomaniac tech overlords who also play a hand in global politics. How is that fair!?</p>\n    <p>And while gen Z might be <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/04/16/generation-z-is-unprecedentedly-rich\">making more money than millennials</a>, they also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/05/gen-z-and-young-millennials-battling-negative-wealth-as-debt-burden-grows\">have more debt</a>, might be having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jun/29/gen-z-sexual-revolution\">less sex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/10/meet-generation-stay-at-home-dont-pay-to-go-clubbing-watch-it-at-home-on-your-phone\">fewer parties</a> and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/09/health/gen-z-happiness-gallup-wellness\">seem generally unhappier</a>.</p>\n    <p>We can chalk that up to unease about the state of the world and an unprecedented access to witnessing the successes of their seemingly happier peers. Things that millennials are all too familiar with.</p>\n    <p>As the saying goes, millennials walked so that gen Z could run … and then make fun of them for it.</p>\n    <p>I propose that gen Z open up their hearts and see that millennials, despite their cheuginess, share more commonalities with them than differences. Maybe then, after they finally embrace their own cringey attributes, they’d see that their “too cool” exterior is a prison of their own making.</p>\n    <p>And yes, sure, millennial cringe is sometimes a bit too much to bear – I for one put forward that we completely remove the phrase “but first, coffee” from the lexicon – but perhaps this type of swagless bravado is the only antidote we have to the hellscape we find ourselves in.</p>\n    <p>To be cringe is to be free. Live, laugh, love.</p>\n    <p>Besides, gen alpha is steadily but surely on their way to dethrone the zoomers from their top spot, so are you ready to be bullied by the “skibidi toilet” generation with no one there to back you up?</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/02/dear-gen-z-lesson-from-zillennial-be-cringe-be-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>I may have found what will finally wean me off social media. It’s this “things I’ve learned” trend. Take, for example, advice that will supposedly “change your brain chemistry”, courtesy of someone who is definitely not a neuroscientist. Or “my nutrition rules”, from a dewy, gen Alpha sylph who doesn’t realise what they actually have is a teenager’s metabolism. Or “45 things you need to understand” about a place from someone who has spent 45 minutes there. Endless lists of the bleeding obvious: eat intuitively, embrace nature, exercise compassion, remain curious, be childlike, contact friends, put down your phone, put your head in a blender.</p>\n    <p>OK, not that last one, but it’s how this stuff makes me feel. I don’t know what to call it – expertise overload? Advice pollution? A bottomless pit of wisdom brain rot? – but authoritatively delivered life advice dominates what I see online, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/substack\">Substack</a> (the online home of cosy, bookish elders) to TikTok (the opposite). It’s not just my algorithm or demographic: men, young people, pregnant people and new parents all get inundated with advice, albeit with different slants.</p>\n    <p>I sort of admire the confidence it must take to tell people what to do. I can barely muster a tentative suggestion of what to have for dinner (crisps?). But it also makes me pine for the internet before everything was a bossy, bullet-pointed self-optimisation plan; for the gentler days of cat memes and rambling blog posts about strangers’ marital problems.</p>\n    <p>Of course, no one is forcing me to consume this content, to roll my eyes at another earnest reel or wrathfully scroll through 1,000 words telling me to “prioritise rest”. But I’m a sucker for it, which is exactly why it’s everywhere: it gets us “engaging” and consuming. It’s undeniably appealing to be told how to live your life when you’re flailing, failing and bewildered (and aren’t we all?). Unfortunately, the only thing I’ve realised from endlessly clicking is that the cure for my confusion will not come from content creators. Uh oh – did I just offer “things I’ve learned” advice?</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/01/ready-to-give-up-social-media-advice-pollution-might-just-get-you-there\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is a violation of international law for an occupier to settle its citizens on the land it has taken.</p>\n<p>Last year, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory that said the entire occupation was illegal.</p>\n<p>But the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is hungry for more settlements.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, the defence minister Israel Katz and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that 22 new settlements would be built in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Katz said the massive expansion, the biggest in decades, was making a \"strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel and serves as a buffer against our enemies\" .</p>\n<p>\"This is a Zionist, security, and national response - and a clear decision on the future of the country,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Next to Katz was the ultra-nationalist leader Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a settlement in the West Bank and believes that the land was given to the Jews by God. He is finance minister but also is effectively the governor of the West Bank with sweeping powers over planning.</p>\n<p>Smotrich called the settlement expansion a \"once-in-a-generation decision\" and declared: \"Next step sovereignty!\"</p>\n<p>Everyone in Israel, and the Palestinians in the territories, know that when Smotrich and his allies say \"sovereignty\" they mean annexation.</p>\n<p>Smotrich wants all the land for Jews and has openly discussed finding ways of removing Palestinians.</p>\n<h2>'We were very, very scared'</h2>\n<p>On hilltop after hilltop in the West Bank are settlements at different stages of their development, from well-established small towns with mature gardens and schools, to outposts with handful of caravans and a militant population of young settlers who often mix religion with extreme Jewish nationalism, firearms and sometimes deadly aggression towards their Palestinian neighbours.</p>\n<p>Statistics collected by the UN and peace campaigners show that violent settlers have increased attacks on their Palestinian neighbours since the 7 October attacks.</p>\n<p>I went to see how that has affected Taybeh, an entirely Christian village of around 1,500 people.</p>\n<p>It is a quiet place that seems to have many more houses than residents. After nearly six hard decades of Israeli occupation, more Taybeh people have been forced to emigrate than now live in the village.</p>\n<p>Two nights before the visit, settlers entered the village when most people were in bed. They burned Kamal Tayea's car and tried unsuccessfully to get into his new house, part of a pleasant development overlooking acres of olive groves. They daubed the walls with graffiti in Hebrew sprayed with red paint.</p>\n<p>Kamal, a middle-aged man reassessing whether his decision to move his family to the edge of the village was wise, is installing a network of security cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We were very, very scared,\" Kamal said. \"I have children and an old mum. Our lives were threatened, and it was terrifying.\"</p>\n<p>I asked him whether Britain's plan to recognise Palestine would make his life any easier.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so. It's a big step to have a superpower like Britain support us, but on the ground, it does not change much. Israel is not compliant with any international resolutions or laws.</p>\n<p>\"It does not listen to any other country in the whole world.\"</p>\n<h2>'Our roots are here. We can't move'</h2>\n<p>During the next night, Jewish settlers raided neighbouring Palestinian communities, burning cars and spraying graffiti. It is more than just vandalism.</p>\n<p>The settlers want the Palestinians out and, in some places in the occupied territories, have succeeded, forcing Palestinians in remote villages out of their farms and stealing their livestock.</p>\n<p>The Greek Orthodox priest, 74-year-old David Khoury was born in Taybeh. In his church he told me that settlers who have threatened him and other residents are often armed.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, they have guns… they'll use them if we argue with them. They want us out, they want us to leave.\"</p>\n<p>The old priest was defiant.</p>\n<p>\"We are here, since Jesus Christ, 2,000 years. Our roots are here. We can't move. We will not move, even if we die here, we will not move from here… Palestine is inside our blood, how we can live without our blood?\"</p>\n<h2>'If you really seek two states, recognise [both]'</h2>\n<p>It was not many miles to Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank, but I wasn't able to get there in person. Israel's checkpoints can make driving back to Jerusalem slow and difficult, so I reached Husam Zomlot via Zoom. He is the head of the Palestinian delegation to the United Kingdom, effectively their ambassador in London. He is back home for the summer and was delighted by Britain's plan to recognise Palestine.</p>\n<p>\"It is a sign that the UK and with it, the rest of the international community are really serious about the two-state solution. We are no longer in the business of the lip service that has lost us three decades. Actually, if you really seek two states, recognise the two states.\"</p>\n<p>\"We see the recognition as the starting gun to a sprint towards implementing and establishing the state of Palestine and fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\"</p>\n<p>Zomlot was jubilant. It was, he said, a first step, and Britain's decision would make a real difference.</p>\n<p>History is one of the powerful drivers of this conflict. Britain, he added, was atoning at last for the wrongs it had done Palestinians when it was the imperial power here between 1917 and 1948.</p>\n<p>He was referring to the promises made in a short, typewritten letter, dated 2 November 1917, signed by the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of Britain's Jewish community. It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p>\n<p>Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p>\n<p>It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p>\n<p>He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p>\n<p>At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p>\n<p>At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p>\n<p>Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East. He is not in a position to punish us, and it definitely will not bring peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"And it's against justice, history, religion, culture... he's giving a huge reward for Yahya Sinwar [the Hamas leader who led the 7 October attacks and was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year].</p>\n<p>\"Wherever he is in hell today, he sees what Keir Starmer says - and says, 'good partner'.\"</p>\n<p>Back in Taybeh, I had asked a group of leading local citizens who were drinking coffee with the mayor in his office what they thought of the UK's recognition plan.</p>\n<p>One of them, a local businessman, said: \"Thank you Britain. But it's too late.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Top image: Getty Images</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6n0eeqp54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Who is in charge? You might think the answer should be obvious.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\"This government should be walking on water, there should be nothing it can't do,\" a Whitehall insider suggests, given the rows and rows and rows - and yes, rows - of Labour MPs who line up behind the prime minister every Wednesday.</p>\n<p>But, by booting out a small band of backbenchers this week, Sir Keir Starmer's put the question of his authority back on the table.</p>\n<p>Answering the question of who is in charge isn't so simple after all.</p>\n<p>This government has a \"backbench they - and we - are surprised to discover they can't control,\" says one senior official.</p>\n<p>The financial markets are breathing down its neck, with the country's debts sky high, and for good measure, what a No 10 source describes as a \"deep current of instability\" around the world.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's next one-to-one meeting with President Donald Trump is a case in point – who knows what he will or won't say alongside the prime minister on Scottish soil next week?</p>\n<p>No-one in government can be sure how that is going to shake down, although I was very definitively told we will not be seeing Sir Keir swinging a club with his transatlantic pal.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, impossible for any administration to be the master of all it surveys. But convincingly displaying authority, inhabiting its power, is a different task.</p>\n<p>And neither all of Sir Keir's MPs, nor all of the people inside the government are sure it's being met.</p>\n<h2>Backbench bust-ups</h2>\n<p>Let's start with the prime minister kicking out four MPs this week after they had objected to various Labour plans and proposals.</p>\n<p>But if Sir Keir really felt in control of his party, why did he need to bother about a group of MPs that wouldn't even fill a family saloon? And why did he do it, just days before accepting some of the logic of one of those he kicked out, Chris Hinchliff, over tweaks to proposed planning laws?</p>\n<p>Bemused? You wouldn't be the only one.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's allies say he always believed there would have to be repercussions for MPs who plot against the government repeatedly, in part because others are asked to defend decisions that might be unpopular or difficult.</p>\n<p>So after the welfare fiasco, the whips were asked to make a list of those who had been actively trying to organise resistance to government plans, rather than just expressing objections.</p>\n<p>After gathering evidence about MPs' behaviour, those four were then shown the door, at least for now, to exert discipline over the backbenches.</p>\n<p>A senior government figure said: \"You can have as big a majority as you want, but if you have no discipline whatsoever it can get chaotic. You can't get chaotic at a time when the country desperately needs its government to get on with things.\"</p>\n<p>It was a separate decision to suspend Diane Abbott - again, a choice made by Labour HQ who felt it had no choice but to act, interpreting her comments as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwye24vjnn8o\">repeating a claim that Jewish people don't experience racism in the same way as black people.</a></p>\n<p>So, \"behave - or else\", is the message to the rest of the backbenches, just when they are about to leave Westminster.</p>\n<p>But have the moves this week made a difference? One senior MP said: \"A lot of people keep wondering, 'Is Keir beholden to his back benches?' I don't think people are like, 'Oh we're going to rebel if we're unhappy all the time'. But there has to be more respect for MPs who are actually out talking to their constituents.\"</p>\n<p>Another senior Labour figure told me, \"No 10 was completely spooked by what happened over welfare – I don't think backbenchers are running it, but they do have a taste for power.\"</p>\n<h2>Are ministers the masters?</h2>\n<p>Who then, is really in charge, I ask a member of the government. They laugh, and say, \"I don't have an answer\".</p>\n<p>The same question posed to another Whitehall figure: \"There is no way of knowing,\" they respond, suggesting sometimes government, even 12 months in, feels chaotic, with contradictory instructions to officials being given, even on the same day.</p>\n<p>It's no secret, and it's not surprising, that working out how to run a country when you haven't done it before is hard.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of ministers and staffers who will of course say loyally that No 10 is now firmly in control after understandable teething troubles, who are also somewhat fed up with the noises off.</p>\n<p>As one government source reckons, \"a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss\". Another insider believes Whitehall is working much better than before. \"In the first six months they were disappointed in us, and we were disappointed with them\".</p>\n<p>The Spending Review process occupied huge amounts of time and effort across government. Now that is over, it's not just the government's purse strings that have been set, but the political priorities alongside. In theory, as that source suggests, \"they are now starting to get on with the doing\".</p>\n<p>But that optimism is not springing from every source.</p>\n<p>One experienced senior official told me: \"A government is in charge if it has a plan, but if it doesn't, it cedes that. They still don't really have a governing plan, so it feels like the PM is in charge, but it is hard for his writ to be made to work.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, it's clearer now, particularly after the big review of spending, what the government wants to do, but not how they plan to do it.</p>\n<p>Another senior figure said: \"They're busy and exhausted going to meetings with each other, and producing documents that no-one ever reads, and conversations that don't lead to anything and telling each other how difficult it is – they don't inhabit their power.\"</p>\n<p>And there's obvious frustration among the government's own members too, one warning of a passive attitude among some colleagues, who could get to the next election and think only, \"Well, I enjoyed driving around in my ministerial car and having my red box\". There is a feeling, like, \"Oh, we are here just to manage, not to lead and drive, and that's not good enough\".</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, one cabinet minister defended the operation, \"It's only been a year, people focus on the problems, if you look at it in the round we have been very, very effective,\" they told me.</p>\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0mn7gmpplo#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20the%20Off%20Air%20with%20Laura%20K%20newsletter%20to%20get%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%27s%20expert%20insight%20and%20insider%20stories%20every%20week%2C%20emailed%20directly%20to%20you.\">Off Air with Laura K</a> newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n<p>Governments are, of course, never short on helpful advice. As well as No 10's own learning on the job, and plans to improve its operations, like a review of communications across government that is under way, there will be other more formal suggestions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Later in the summer a set of proposals will be published by a think-tank with close links to No 10 and Labour, the Future Governance Forum, that's chaired by the former senior civil servant, Helen MacNamara.</p>\n<p>The review will recommend a new government department, called \"Downing Street\", to give this and future prime ministers a more powerful centre of government so that No 10 can make decisions more quickly, and execute its plans more effectively.</p>\n<p>Government insiders may not have appetite for any big bang changes, although they have pledged themselves on many occasions to \"rewire\" the government.</p>\n<p>The respected Institute for Government already warned this week that big changes were needed if \"ministers were serious\" about their promise to rewire the state, concluding in its own research that Sir Keir's notion of \"mission driven government\" looks \"shaky\", and that government departments had reverted to old habits.</p>\n<p>Moving desks and chairs around Whitehall, whether creating new departments or axing the old, wouldn't exactly make the pulse of the public quicken, but perhaps it ought to be on the agenda for a government that has struggled sometimes to exert its will.</p>\n<h2>The mighty markets</h2>\n<p>If ministers' grip isn't as tight as it might be, and backbenchers aren't calling the shots, there is no doubt there's another huge controlling factor.</p>\n<p>A senior Labour source tells me, \"People like to boil this down to palace politics,\" the jockeying for power between politicians, or the competing beliefs inside the party.</p>\n<p>Surely not, Westminster enjoying a soap opera about the battle for the party's soul?</p>\n<p>But instead they argue, \"The markets are fundamentally a really major part of it – the government isn't making challenging decisions because it enjoys annoying people, or making life hard\".</p>\n<p>It's true the fights inside and outside the government are so often driven by cash sloshing around or falling down the back of the sofa.</p>\n<p>Spoiler, overall spending is enormous but Rachel Reeves keeps a very tight grip on her wallet.</p>\n<p>By instinct, Labour politicians normally want public spending to be generous.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxwe3g4wl5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And the swing to Sir Keir Starmer's party in both places was enormous, nearly 20%.</p>\n    <p>Our panel was selected by the political research group, More in Common, and the questions were asked to the group not by me, but by its director, Luke Tryl.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7834/live/299388f0-58f2-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.png.webp\" alt=\"Jack Hill/The Times/PA Wire Rachel Reeves listens to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaking at the launch of the Government's 10-year health plan&#10;\"/>\n    <p>It's worth knowing too, when our panel was recruited, they were not told they would be asked about politics.</p>\n    <p>It could have been for any other market research exercise, for washing powder or water bills, rather than anything to do with Westminster - so it wasn't a gathering of political junkies.</p>\n    <p>But our group, who all voted Labour last time, certainly had a strong sense of what has happened to the government they elected just twelve months ago, and it wasn't pretty.</p>\n    <p>First of all, we asked the group about their impressions of Labour's first year back in office, overall.</p>\n    <p>The overwhelming sense, and one of the words used most often, was \"disappointed\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e36f/live/f9bff3d0-59b3-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp\" alt=\"From top left (L-R): Yvette, Kirsty, Ramesh, Hayley.

She was frustrated about what she sees as a lack of progress on immigration. \"Everything they promised, nothing has come of it yet,\" Kelly said. \"Immigration is a big thing for me.\"</p>\n    <p>Adam, is an illustrator aged 37. He was a bit more forgiving of Sir Keir's problems: \"They are patching things up, the first year is not the year to push the big ideas, let's steady the ship.\"</p>\n    <p>But 30-year-old Sodiq, who owns his own business, reckons Labour hadn't been completely straight about what its plans were to start with.</p>\n    <p>\"I think a lot of the things that were promised were never going to happen,\" Sodiq said.</p>\n    <p>Kirsty, who's 35 and a teacher, even told us, \"I feel lied to\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9ed/live/224e92b0-58f2-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.png.webp\" alt=\"House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire Screen grab of Rachel Reeves (right) crying as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London&#10;\"/>\n    <p>What about the chaos of Parliament this week, and Labour's many changes of direction since they've been in office? The group had definitely noticed what had gone on in the last seven days, not always the case when it comes to shenanigans in SW1.</p>\n    <p>Veronica, a 64-year-old carer, had seen the chancellor's tears and had some sympathy.</p>\n    <p>\"I think she's trying her best - there are going to be teething problems, it's only the first year.\" But she said, \"crying at the Commons the other day and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did?

Kelly said: \"They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive.\"</p>\n    <p>Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round.</p>\n    <p>\"If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,\" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though \"a lot of bad things are said about him\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f0d/live/393463b0-58f2-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.png.webp\" alt=\"Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer  &#10;\"/>\n    <p>But Sodiq said: \"I'm at the other end of the scale.

    "body": "<p>The Trump administration has ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to carry out sweeping raids, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-arrests-under-trump-100k/\">deporting thousands of immigrants</a>, often without due process. It has targeted left-leaning foreign students and entire universities, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/nx-s1-5424450/ways-trump-administration-is-going-after-colleges\">canceling visas and threatening to withhold federal funding</a>. United States Supreme Court appointments from the previous Trump administration have resulted in decisions that enabled roughly half of US states to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/videos/370668/how-trump-could-ban-abortion-medication-president\">severely restrict or ban abortions</a>. And Trump’s threats of a further crackdown still hang over the country, including vows to jail <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/22/nx-s1-5161480/trump-media-threats-abc-cbs-60-minutes-journalists\">journalists</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/trump-vows-prosecute-political-foes-others-corrupt-cheaters-rcna169292\">political foes</a>.</p>\n<p>To carry out these plans, the administration has tapped into, and may yet expand, the American government’s vast surveillance machinery. That means now is the time for anyone in an at-risk group and those who communicate with them—or even those who want to normalize privacy and create cover for more vulnerable people—to think about how they can upgrade their data security and surveillance resistance.</p>\n<p>“Undocumented immigrants, Muslims, pregnant people, journalists, really anyone who doesn't support him” need to reconsider their personal privacy safeguards, says Runa Sandvik, a former digital security staffer for The New York Times and the founder of the security firm Granitt, which focuses on protecting members of civil society. “Whatever platforms you're on, whatever devices you have, you need to have a sense of what kind of data you’re generating and then use the controls available to limit who can see what you're doing.”</p>\n<p>Protection from surveillance comes in two forms: top-down legal and policy limits on data collection, and bottom-up technological protections in the hands of the targets of that surveillance. The US is now in an era where Trump allies control all three branches of government and tech companies appear to be ready to bend to their will—as evidenced by the Silicon Valley CEOs’ postelection <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/big-tech-ceos-send-well-wishes-trump-musk-bezos-zuckerberg-rcna179010\">race to congratulate the president-elect</a>.</p>\n<p>That may leave the technology you choose to use as a last line of defense, says Harlo Holmes, the director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “This is the last recourse of a lot of people in vulnerable positions,” says Holmes. “We’re just going to have to increase our efforts to make sure that people have the best tools in their hands and their pockets to maintain their privacy. And it's going to matter more and more.”</p>\n<p>To respond to that new reality, WIRED asked security and privacy experts for their advice for hardening personal privacy protections and resisting surveillance. Here are their recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Encrypted Communications</h2>\n<p>Securing your data starts with securing your communications, and securing your communications means using end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/\">End-to-end encrypted messengers</a> like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/\">Signal</a>, WhatsApp, and Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime are all designed to encrypt your messages and phone calls such that no one can decrypt and access your conversations other than the recipient—not even the company that offers the service. That’s very different from traditional calls and texts, which are subject to law enforcement interception and data requests to your phone carrier.</p>\n<p>Digital services like Facebook Messenger, Telegram, or X may say their direct messages offer “encryption,” but in the default setting that almost everyone uses, they only encrypt information in transit to the server that runs the service. On that server, the information is then decrypted and accessible to the company that controls that server, or any government agency that demands they share that data—like the Nebraska police who demanded Facebook <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-turned-chat-messages-mother-daughter-now-charged-abortion-rcna42185\">hand over chats about a 17-year-old’s illegal abortion in 2022</a>, then brought criminal charges against her and her mother.</p>\n<p>Among actual end-to-end encrypted messengers, Signal is broadly recommended as offering the best privacy protections. Importantly, Signal doesn’t collect or store metadata about who is calling or texting whom, information that can often be nearly as sensitive as the content of conversations. That’s a crucial safeguard given that Trump has said in his recent campaigning, for instance, that he will hunt down and prosecute government staffers leaking information to journalists—and his previous administration <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-business-arts-and-entertainment-government-and-politics-ca37d8079ee3ae88ba1bea1158e14f59\">seized the phone and email records of reporters</a> at The New York Times and CNN. With Signal, there are no records to seize. “Metadata matters,” says Holmes.</p>\n<p>Just as important is that Signal offers flexible settings for “disappearing messages” that self-delete on every device used in a conversation after a chosen time, in as little as five seconds. Be sure to turn this feature on to prevent messages from being read in the event that your phone is seized—or the phone of the person on the other side of the conversation. Signal also doesn’t back up communication logs to iCloud or other cloud services, so there’s less risk that a participant in the conversation will accidentally leak everyone’s messages to a server where they can be accessed. “If it's up to me, I will choose Signal, because I know that there is less that you can do on <i>your</i> end to potentially put our communications at risk,” says Granitt’s Sandvik.</p>\n<h2>Encrypted Devices</h2>\n<p>Just as important as encrypting your conversations is strongly encrypting your devices themselves.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>A major groundswell of nationwide protests against the second Trump administration has arrived.</p>\n<p>If you're going to join any protests, as is your right under the First Amendment, you need to think beyond your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-gear-tips/\">physical well-being</a> to your digital security, too. The same <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/\">surveillance apparatus</a> that’s enabling the Trump administration’s raids of undocumented people and targeting of left-leaning activists will no doubt be out in full force on the streets.</p>\n<p>Two key elements of digital surveillance should be top of mind for protestors. One is the data that authorities could potentially <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/guide-getting-past-customs-digital-privacy-intact/\">obtain from your phone</a> if you are detained, arrested, or they confiscate your device. The other is surveillance of all the identifying and revealing information that you produce when you attend a protest, which can include wireless interception of text messages and more, and tracking tools like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-license-plate-readers-cheaper-drive-carefully/\">license plate scanners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/few-rules-govern-police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology/\">face recognition</a>. You should be mindful of both.</p>\n<p>After all, police have already <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/george-floyd-protests-police-violence.html?via=homepage_taps_top\">demonstrated their willingness</a> to arrest and attack entirely peaceful protesters as well as journalists observing demonstrations. In that light, you should assume that any digital evidence that you were at or near a protest could be used against you.</p>\n<p>“The Trump administration is weaponizing essentially every lever of government to shut down, suppress, and curtail criticism of the administration and of the US government generally, and there have never been more surveillance toys available to law enforcement and to US government agencies,” says Evan Greer, the deputy director of the activist organization Fight for the Future, who also wrote a helpful <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evan_greer/status/1266907715437121536\">X (then-Twitter) thread laying out digital security advice</a> during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. “That said, there are a number of very simple, concrete things that you can do that make it exponentially more difficult for someone to intercept your communications, for a bad actor to ascertain your real-time location, or for the government to gain access to your private information.”</p>\n<p>\n      <i>This story was originally published on May 31, 2020 and updated on June 12, 2025.</i>\n    </p>\n<h2>Your Phone</h2>\n<p>The most important decision to make before leaving home for a protest is whether to bring your phone—or what phone to bring. A smartphone broadcasts all sorts of identifying information; law enforcement can force your mobile carrier to cough up data about what cell towers your phone connects to and when. Police in the US have also been documented using so-called stingray devices, or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dnc-hidden-signal-hunt/\">IMSI catchers</a>, that impersonate cell towers and trick all the phones in a certain area into connecting to them. This can give cops the individual mobile subscriber identity number of everyone at a protest at a given time, undermining the anonymity of entire crowds en masse.</p>\n<p>“The device in your pocket is definitely going to give off information that could be used to identify you,” says Harlo Holmes, director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a nonprofit press advocacy group. (Disclosure: WIRED’s global editorial director, Katie Drummond, serves on Freedom of the Press Foundation’s board.)</p>\n<p>For that reason, Holmes suggests that protesters who want anonymity leave their primary phone at home altogether. If you do need a phone for coordination or as a way to call friends or a lawyer in case of an emergency, keep it off as much as possible to reduce the chances that it connects to a rogue cell tower or Wi-Fi hot spot being used by law enforcement for surveillance. Sort out logistics with friends in advance so you only need to turn your phone on if something goes awry. Or to be even more certain that your phone won’t be tracked, keep it in a Faraday bag that blocks all of its radio communications. Open the bag only when necessary. Holmes herself uses and recommends the <a href=\"https://mosequipment.com/products/mission-darkness-small-window-faraday-bag?variant=10642588229\">Mission Darkness Faraday bag</a>.</p>\n<p>If you do need a mobile device, consider bringing only a secondary phone you don’t use often, or a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-burner-phone/\">burner</a>. Your main smartphone likely has the majority of your digital accounts and data on it, all of which law enforcement could conceivably access if they confiscate your phone. But don’t assume that any backup phone you buy will grant you anonymity. If you give a prepaid carrier your identifying details, after all, your “burner” phone could be no more anonymous than your primary device. “Don’t expect because you got it from Duane Reade that you’re automatically a character from <i>The Wire</i>,” Holmes cautions.</p>\n<p>Instead of a burner phone, Holmes argues that it may be far more practical to simply own a secondary phone that you’ve set up to be less sensitive—leaving off accounts and apps that offer your most private information to anyone who seizes it, such as social media, email, and messaging apps. “Choosing a secondary device that limits the amount of personal data that you have on you at all times is probably your best protection,” Holmes says.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what phone you’re using, consider that traditional calls and text messages are vulnerable to surveillance. That means you need to use end-to-end encryption. Ideally, you and those you communicate with should use disappearing messages set to self-delete after a few hours or days. The encrypted messaging and calling app <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/\">Signal</a> has <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/signal-encrypted-messaging-features-mainstream/\">perhaps the best and longest track record</a>. Just make sure you and the people you’re communicating with are using the same app, since they’re not interoperable.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protest-safely-surveillance-digital-privacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Imagine you meet someone new. Be it on a dating app or social media, you chance across each other online and get to talking. They’re genuine and relatable, so you quickly take it out of the DMs to a platform like Telegram or WhatsApp. You exchange photos and even video call each over. You start to get comfortable. Then, suddenly, they bring up money.</p>\n<p>They need you to cover the cost of their Wi-Fi access, maybe. Or they’re trying out this new cryptocurrency. You should really get in on it early! And then, only after it’s too late, you realize that the person you were talking to was in fact not real at all.</p>\n<p>They were a real-time AI-generated deepfake hiding the face of someone running a scam.</p>\n<p>This scenario might sound too dystopian or science-fictional to be true, but it has happened to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/yahoo-boys-real-time-deepfake-scams/\">countless people already</a>. With the spike in the capabilities of generative AI over the past few years, scammers can now create realistic fake faces and voices to mask their own in real time. And experts warn that those deepfakes can supercharge a dizzying variety of online scams, from romance to employment to tax fraud.</p>\n<p>David Maimon, the head of fraud insights at identity verification firm SentiLink and a professor of criminology at Georgia State University, has been tracking the evolution of AI romance scams and other kinds of AI fraud for the past six years. “We’re seeing a dramatic increase in the volume of deepfakes, especially in comparison to 2023 and 2024,” Maimon says.</p>\n<p>“It wasn’t a whole lot. We’re talking about maybe four or five a month,” he says. “Now, we’re seeing hundreds of these on a monthly basis across the board, which is mind-boggling.”</p>\n<p>Deepfakes are already being used in a variety of online scams. One finance worker in Hong Kong, for example, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/\">paid $25 million</a> to a scammer posing as the company’s chief financial officer in a deepfaked video call. Some deepfake scammers have even posted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ7lYgSZ0Vc\">instructional videos</a> on YouTube, which have a disclaimer as being for “pranks and educational purposes only.” Those videos usually open with a romance scam call, where an AI-generated handsome young man is talking to an older woman.</p>\n<p>More traditional deepfakes—such as a pre-rendered video of a celebrity or politician, rather than a live fake—have also become more prevalent. Last year, a retiree in New Zealand <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/pensioner-loses-224k-after-being-tricked-by-ai-deepfake-christopher-luxon-cryptocurrency-investment-scam/YLG3EQMOAZATVARBL5ITDRL2DA/\">lost around $133,000</a> to a cryptocurrency investment scam after seeing a Facebook advertisement featuring a deepfake of the country’s prime minister encouraging people to buy in.</p>\n<p>Maimon says SentiLink has started to see deepfakes used to create bank accounts in order to lease an apartment or engage in tax refund fraud. He says an increasing number of companies have also seen deepfakes in video job interviews.</p>\n<p>“ Anything that requires folks to be online and which supports the opportunity of swapping faces with someone—that will be available and open for fraud to take advantage of,” Maimon says.</p>\n<p>Part of the reason for this increase is that the barriers for creating deepfakes are getting lower. There are a lot of easily accessible AI tools that can generate realistic faces and a lot of tools that can animate those faces or create full-length videos out of them. Scammers often use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY5suVb0BSI\">images and videos of real people</a>, deepfaked to slightly change their faces or alter what they’re saying, to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ai-phone-scam-voice-call-b2459449.html\">target their loved ones</a> or hijack their public influence.</p>\n<p>Matt Groh, a professor of management at Northwestern University who researches people’s ability to detect deepfakes, says that point-and-click generative AI tools make it much easier to make small, believable changes to already-existing media.</p>\n<p>“If there’s an image of you on the internet, that would be enough to manipulate a face to look like it’s saying something that you haven’t said before or doing something you haven’t done before,” Groh says.</p>\n<p>It’s not just fake video that you need to be worried about. With a few clips of audio, it’s also possible to make a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-account-scam-deepfakes-ai-voice-generator-crime-fraud-2025-5\">believable copy of somebody’s voice</a>. One study in 2023 found that humans failed to detect deepfake audio <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0285333\">over a quarter of the time</a>.</p>\n<p>“ Just a single image and five seconds of audio online mean that it’s definitely possible for a scammer to make some kind of realistic deepfake of you,” Groh says.</p>\n<p>Deepfakes are becoming more pervasive in contexts other than outright scams. Social media has been <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/inside-the-booming-ai-pimping-industry-3/\">flooded over the past year</a> with AI-generated “influencers” stealing content from adult creators by deepfaking new faces onto their bodies and monetizing the resulting videos. Deepfakes have even bled over into geopolitics, like when the mayors of multiple European capital cities held video calls with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/european-leaders-deepfake-video-calls-mayor-of-kyiv-vitali-klitschko\">fake version of the mayor of Kyiv, Ukraine</a>. People have started using deepfakes for personal reasons, like <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/05/12/1250835619/deepfakes-for-the-dead\">bringing back a dead relative</a> or creating an avatar of <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/i-loved-that-ai-judge-moved-by-ai-generated-avatar-of-man-killed-in-road-rage-incident/\">a victim to testify in court</a>.</p>\n<p>So, if deepfakes are everywhere, how do you spot one? The answer is not technology. A number of technology companies, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/07/technology/openai-deepfake-detector.html\">including OpenAI</a>, have launched deepfake detection tools. Researchers have also proposed mechanisms to detect deepfakes based on things like <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/an-astronomy-technique-could-detect-deepfakes-through-peoples-eyes/\">light reflected in a person’s eyes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/ai-can-now-detect-deepfakes-by-looking-for-weird-facial-movements/?ref=404media.co\">inconsistent facial movements</a>, and have started investigating how to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13152947\">implement them in real time</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/youre-not-ready-for-ai-powered-scams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The fate of President Joe Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n            The justices <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-arguments-takeaways/index.html\">heard arguments on February 28</a> in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\n    </p>\n<p>About 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 – prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.</p>\n<p>\n            The administration <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-launch/index.html\">officially launched the application</a> on October 17, 2022, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            If the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/means-testing-student-loan-forgiveness-what-matters/index.html\">eligible for the debt relief</a>. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded. \n    </p>\n<p>Second, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.</p>\n<p>\n            If a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html\">qualifying borrower</a> also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/pell-grant-student-loan-forgiveness/index.html\">Pell grants</a> are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and <a href=\"https://ticas.org/files/pub_files/students_at_the_greatest_risk_of_default.pdf\">end up in default</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>Here’s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:</p>\n<h2>What are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?</h2>\n<p>The Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.</p>\n<p>\n            One of the lawsuits was brought by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-ruling/index.html\">six Republican-led states</a>, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n    </p>\n<p>A lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.</p>\n<p>\n            The other challenge that the Supreme Court heard<i> </i>was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some. \n    </p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.</p>\n<p>\n            Lawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1528451/download\">memo</a> from<i> </i>the Department of Justice. \n    </p>\n<h2>When will I receive my debt relief?</h2>\n<p>It’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.</p>\n<p>Administration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won’t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.</p>\n<p>\n            On November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/politics/student-loan-payments-pause-ends-october/index.html\">due starting in October</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-payments-debt-ceiling-deal/index.html\">law passed in early June </a>that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\n    </p>\n<p>The White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.</p>\n<p>If and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.</p>\n<p>\n            If the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application\">https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Applicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.</p>\n<p>Borrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.</p>\n<h2>What kind of federal loans are eligible?</h2>\n<p>There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.</p>\n<p>But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>\n            The Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-lawsuit/index.html\">but reversed course last September</a> when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers. \n    </p>\n<p>Defaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.</p>\n<h2>What year is the income threshold based on?</h2>\n<p>\n            If Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income\">adjusted gross income</a> for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n    </p>\n<p>A taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.</p>\n<h2>How will the government know what my income was?</h2>\n<p>The Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.</p>\n<p>Millions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.</p>\n<h2>Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?</h2>\n<p>Borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.</p>\n<p>But it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.</p>\n<h2>I’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.</p>\n<p>\n            Eligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency\">dependent students</a>, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n    </p>\n<h2>I have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.</p>\n<h2>I’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?</h2>\n<p>\n            Yes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent\">Parent PLUS</a> loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n    </p>\n<p>But a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.</p>\n<h2>How do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.</p>\n    <p>In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.</p>\n    <p>Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.</p>\n    <p>Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.</p>\n    <p>\n            Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as <i>Pseudoliparis belyaevi</i> – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.</p>\n    <p>Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.</p>\n    <p>“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/asia/deepest-fish-filmed-off-japan-scn-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/world/climate-warming-emissions-study-intl/index.html\">escalating climate crisis</a> is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Strategy and consulting firm <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/sites/default/files/studies/Simon-Kucher_Global_Sustainability_Study_2021.pdf\">Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021</a> found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            This shift in consumer preferences has propelled <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/business/business-climate-earth-day-roundup/index.html\">many beauty brands to set environmental goals</a>: to move away from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/us/plastic-recycling-climate-impact-lbg/index.html\">single-use and virgin plastics</a>, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.\n    </p>\n<p>However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.</p>\n<h2>Ingredient and branding transparency</h2>\n<p>\n            There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2023/03/13/jessica-alba-honest-company-criticism-wtcw-vpx.cnn\">“greenwashing,”</a> where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Companies often use marketing language like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/clean-beauty-vs-green-beauty\">“clean beauty”</a> to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.\n    </p>\n<p>“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”</p>\n<p>\n            In a <a href=\"https://britishbeautycouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-courage-to-change.pdf\">2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change”</a> their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”\n    </p>\n<p>“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.</p>\n<p>\n            Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/health/makeup-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html\">including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde</a> — it claims to never use in its products.)\n    </p>\n<p>“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”</p>\n<p>“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”</p>\n<p>Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”</p>\n<h2>Unpacking plastics</h2>\n<p>\n            The industry’s plastic packaging is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/energy/single-use-plastics-volume-grows-climate-intl-hnk/index.html\">a particular sustainability challenge</a> — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used <a href=\"https://gc-22.emf.org/ppu/\">144,430 metric tons of plastic</a> in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/environment/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.htm\">only recycles 4% of its plastic waste</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)</p>\n<p>“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.</p>\n<p>However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.</p>\n<p>Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.</p>\n<p>“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”</p>\n<h2>The weight of retail</h2>\n<p>Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.</p>\n<p>\n            “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/beauty-brand-recycling-programs\">Smaller businesses do more</a>, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Sephora launched its “<a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/eco-friendly-beauty\">Clean + Planet Positive</a>” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/economy/climate-change-inflation-food-energy-prices/index.html\">throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping</a>, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with. \n    </p>\n<h2>The missing player</h2>\n<p>\n            The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/\">B Corporation, or B Corp</a>. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/how-to-shop-big-box-retailers-vs-brands-sustainably\">eco-conscious consumers</a>, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.\n    </p>\n<p>Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.</p>\n<p>Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.</p>\n<p>“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.</p>\n<p>\n            And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency <a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/cosmetics-prohibited-substances?p_p_id=eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByCol=fld_erc2_appname&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_substance_identifier_field_key=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_delta=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByType=asc&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_doSearch=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_deltaParamValue=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_resetCur=false&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_cur=3\"> lists 2,495 substances</a> banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/prohibited-restricted-ingredients-cosmetics\">only lists 11</a>, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/does-europe-have-better-sunscreens/#.Wl-GvpM-d-U\">lab tests of 51 sunscreen products</a> in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard. \n    </p>\n<p>However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.</p>\n<p>“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>OPEC and its allies’ surprise move to slash oil production will soon be felt at US gas pumps.</p>\n    <p>\n            The group known as OPEC+ announced Sunday it would<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/opec-production-cuts/index.html\"> cut oil production</a> by more than 1.6 million barrels a day starting in May, running through the end of the year. The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday. \n    </p>\n    <p>The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.</p>\n    <p>“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”</p>\n    <p>The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.</p>\n    <p>“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.</p>\n    <p>\n            The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html\">record $5.02 a gallon on June 14</a>, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/energy/gas-prices-rise/index.html\">average price fell every day</a>. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/strategic-petroleum-reserve-joe-biden/index.html\">US Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a>, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline. \n    </p>\n    <p>Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.</p>\n    <p>“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194318-02-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.\"/>\n    <h2>Rising pressure</h2>\n    <p>\n            The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/kevin-mccarthy-taiwan-president-meeting-china/index.html\">announced</a> earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication<strong> </strong>amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\">suspected Chinese surveillance balloon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/us-sanctions-chips-china-xi-tech-ambitions-intl-hnk/index.html\">semiconductor supply chains</a> – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n    </p>\n    <p>Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.</p>\n    <p>But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.</p>\n    <p>For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.</p>\n    <p>China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.</p>\n    <p>The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”</p>\n    <p>It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.</p>\n    <p>While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.</p>\n    <p>Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.</p>\n    <p>Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.</p>\n    <p>Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194350-03-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency.\"/>\n    <h2>Beijing watching</h2>\n    <p>A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>\n            Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-public-opinion-military-response-pelosi-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric</a> in mainland China. \n    </p>\n    <p>This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.</p>\n    <p>But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.</p>\n    <p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.</p>\n    <p>\n            It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/asia/taiwan-former-president-ma-visit-china-intl-hnk/index.html\">Ma Ying-jeou</a>, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n    </p>\n    <p>Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.</p>\n    <p>\n            China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/china/taiwan-ukraine-parallels-china-russia-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">global spotlight</a> following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Beijing has recently sought to position itself as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/china/china-position-political-settlement-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">an agent of peace</a> in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n    </p>\n    <p>This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.</p>\n    <p>\n            An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/biden-xi-meeting-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/h_93dc31c74b4bfe3b5ab35a8c0bb23901\">face-to-face meeting</a> in Bali. \n    </p>\n    <p>“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p>\n    <p>“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220819143103-china-amb-nicholas-burns-vpx.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"China Amb Nicholas Burns vpx\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed reporting.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.</p>\n    <p>He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/victor-j-glover/biography\">Glover</a> is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/02/tech/nasa-spacex-astronauts-return-iss-highlights-scn/index.html\">piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft</a> and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n    </p>\n    <p>“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.</p>\n    <p>Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/christina-hammock-koch/biography/\">Koch</a>, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/world/nasa-all-female-spacewalk-koch-meir-scn-trnd/index.html\">first all-female spacewalk in 2019</a>. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\n    </p>\n    <h2>About this mission</h2>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/world/nasa-splashdown-artemis-i-orion-sunday-scn/index.html\">uncrewed test mission</a> that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120057-artemis-ii-crew-official-portrait.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The Artemis II lunar flyby mission crew members include (from left): NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman (foreground) and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\"/>\n    <p>If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n    <p>The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.</p>\n    <p>The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.</p>\n    <p>After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n    <p>Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/world/nasa-spacesuits-moon-artemis-unveil-scn/index.html\">spacesuits</a> for walking on the moon and a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/business/spacex-static-fire-starship-super-heavy-scn/index.html\">lunar lander</a> to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            NASA is targeting a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis-iii/\">2025 launch date</a> for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf\">2026 or later</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.</p>\n    <h2>Picking the astronauts</h2>\n    <p>\n            Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/world/nasa-artemis-moon-secretive-crew-selection-process/index.html\">selection process</a>. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/astronaut-right-stuff-apollo-11-trnd-scn/index.html\">inaugural missions</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.</p>\n    <p>“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”</p>\n    <p>She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”</p>\n    <p>“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.</p>\n    <p>\n  <i>CNN’s Kristin Fisher contributed to this story.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.\n    </p>\n    <p>Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.</p>\n    <p>The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.</p>\n    <p>This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.</p>\n    <p>\n            Inflation in the United Kingdom also <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/22/economy/inflation-uk-surprise-rise-february/index.html\">jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February</a>, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The pound turnaround</h2>\n    <p>The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.</p>\n    <p>The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.</p>\n    <p>“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.</p>\n    <p>But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.</p>\n    <p>“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.</p>\n    <p>The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.</p>\n    <p>Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.</p>\n    <p>A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.</p>\n    <p>Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.</p>\n    <p>“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The group is performing well as a whole.”</p>\n    <p>Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120210-01-hsbc-shareholders-040323-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, left, and Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, departing following the bank's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.\"/>\n    <p>\n            Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/investing/dividends-coronavirus-recession/index.html\">scrapping its dividend</a> in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.</p>\n    <p>“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.</p>\n    <p>“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/investing/hsbc-stock-earnings-2021-intl-hnk/index.html\">bringing back its dividend</a> in 2021, albeit at a lower level.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403082458-hsbc-hong-kong-file-2022-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"An HSBC bank branch in Hong Kong last July. HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors' portfolios in the city, which is also its top market.\"/>\n    <p>Ken Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.</p>\n    <p>The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.</p>\n    <p>Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”</p>\n    <p>His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.</p>\n    <h2>The Ping An question</h2>\n    <p>HSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.</p>\n    <p>\n            Ping An\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PNGAY&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (PNGAY)</a>, China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            In a series of <a href=\"https://group.pingan.com/media/news/2022/Ping-An-Asset-Management--HSBC-advised-to-carefully-study-proposals-to-improve-operating-performance-and-enhance-value.html\">remarks</a> made public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve HSBC’s performance and value.” \n    </p>\n    <p>Since then, the insurance giant’s views haven’t changed, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n    <p>The source told CNN that Ping An has been calling for HSBC to explore a reorganization, with an eye on boosting its valuation and simplifying its regulatory obligations around the globe.</p>\n    <p>The insurer has not recommended a specific path forward but will support any initiatives, including a spinoff of its Asian business, that could boost its stock performance or value, the person added. Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.</p>\n    <h2>Banking sector turmoil</h2>\n    <p>\n            HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/investing/svb-uk-business-deal-intl-hnk/index.html\">scooped up</a> the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.\n    </p>\n    <p>Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.</p>\n    <p>“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.</p>\n    <p>Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers. They pushed back on the notion that management hadn’t had time to carry out proper due diligence.</p>\n    <p>Tucker also weighed in on recent tumult in the banking industry, saying he did not expect an “immediate impact” on HSBC.</p>\n    <p>“After the collapse of a number of smaller regional banks and the takeover of Credit Suisse, the share prices of all banks have been suppressed,” he noted.</p>\n    <p>But he said he did not believe such developments represented “a systemic risk” to the sector. “I do expect a period of uncertainty” before nerves settle, he added.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/business/hsbc-spin-off-hk-shareholder-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In 2019, they <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/business/ceo-letter-abortion-ad-new-york-times/index.html\">called</a> abortion bans “bad for business.” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/01/business/corporate-pac-suspensions/\">pledged</a> to halt their political giving.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/companies-pulling-back-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html\">curtail</a> their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Dick’s Sporting Goods <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/10/business/dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-edward-stack-profile/index.html\">stopped selling</a> semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/22/news/companies/citigroup-gun-restrictions/index.html\">new restrictions</a> on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/business/walmart-gun-policy-reactions/index.html\">Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past <a href=\"https://www.ceosforgunsafety.org/pages/2022-letter\">summer</a> nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/business/sonnenfeld-yale-corporate-responsibility-uvalde/index.html\">address it</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            That’s why corporate America’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/business/guns-corporate-america-nashville/index.html\">silence</a> in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/11/sonnenfeld-russia-ukraine-corporations/\">vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility</a> who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said. \n    </p>\n    <p>Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>This interview has been edited for clarity and length. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: </strong>Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism? \n    </p>\n    <p>The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.</p>\n    <p>The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Yeah, they’re frustrated.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.</p>\n    <h2>Tesla sales again fall short of production</h2>\n    <p>\n            <i>By CNN’s Chris Isidore </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Tesla <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/investing/tesla-sales?utm_source=business_ribbon\">reported. </a> a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.\n    </p>\n    <p>The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.</p>\n    <p>Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n    <p>But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.</p>\n    <p>“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.</p>\n    <p>But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122521-03-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_256,c_fill\" alt=\"Eric Tourigny\"/>\n    <p>\n            The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">country’s first public pet cemetery.</a> Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">50% of families own a pet.</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            How did a city that is <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">home to 180,000 dogs</a> not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.com/20230314/barcelona-to-be-first-city-in-spain-to-create-a-public-pet-cemetery/\">according to</a> Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UvjZDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=human+and+animal+space+in+historic+pet+cemeteries+in+london+new+york+and+paris&amp;ots=5DyRzv-Zg6&amp;sig=VwfcnzIu98xlWlqi8eVWtpMN4kw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20and%20animal%20space%20in%20historic%20pet%20cemeteries%20in%20london%20new%20york%20and%20paris&amp;f=false\">since the late 19th century.</a> Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A grave discovery</h2>\n    <p>I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.</p>\n    <p>This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.</p>\n    <p>This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122425-02-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;Darling Sammie,&quot; reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks.\"/>\n    <p>This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.</p>\n    <p>Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.</p>\n    <p>The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.</p>\n    <h2>A member of the family</h2>\n    <p>Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.</p>\n    <p>\n            My <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2020.191\">study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain</a> from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.\n    </p>\n    <p>By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”</p>\n    <p>Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”</p>\n    <p>I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.</p>\n    <p>\n            Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/nyregion/new-york-burial-plots-will-now-allow-four-legged-companions.html\">co-burial of cremated animals and people</a>, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Modern mourning</h2>\n    <p>For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.</p>\n    <p>The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.</p>\n    <p>\n            The RSPCA reassures the public <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/bereavement\">on its website</a> that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the <a href=\"https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet-bereavement-and-pet-loss\">Blue Cross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rainbowsbridge.com/grief_support_center/grief_support_home.htm\">Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center</a> offer counseling to bereaved humans.\n    </p>\n    <p>Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.</p>\n    <p>At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.</p>\n    <p>\n            This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and <a href=\"https://www.virtualpetcemetery.org/pet/index.html\">digital pet cemeteries</a> also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.\n    </p>\n    <p>Whether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief – and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/opinions/pet-cemeteries-burying-animals-history-tourigny/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n            Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/health/mucosal-immunity-covid-19/index.html\">virus gets its first foothold</a> in the body.\n    </p>\n    <p>In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.</p>\n    <p>Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.</p>\n    <h2>Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines</h2>\n    <p>The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.</p>\n    <p>As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.</p>\n    <p>Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.</p>\n    <p>One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.</p>\n    <p>It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.</p>\n    <p>The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.</p>\n    <p>“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.</p>\n    <p>The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.</p>\n    <p>The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.</p>\n    <p>“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <h2>Promising results in animal studies</h2>\n    <p>\n            In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nmicrobiol/\">Nature Microbiology</a>, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.</p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.</p>\n    <p>As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.</p>\n    <p>“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.</p>\n    <p>The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.</p>\n    <p>It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.</p>\n    <p>In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.</p>\n    <h2>More on the way</h2>\n    <p>\n            At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines\">according t</a>o the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.  \n    </p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.</p>\n    <p>Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.</p>\n    <p>One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.</p>\n    <p>The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.</p>\n    <p>“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.</p>\n    <p>FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.</p>\n    <h3>Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://form.cnn.com/results_are_in?source=article\">Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    </p>\n    <p>Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.</p>\n    <p>Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.</p>\n    <p>“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.</p>\n    <p>They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.</p>\n    <p>“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”</p>\n    <p>Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.</p>\n    <p>Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.</p>\n    <p>But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230327154938-06-israel-protests-0327.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Israelis protest during a demonstration after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Jerusalem, on March 27, 2023. \"/>\n    <p>\n            Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.” <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans.

    "body": "<p>\n    <strong>Editor’s Note: </strong><i>A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. </i><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/newsletters/meanwhile-in-middle-east\"> Sign up here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n            Turkey’s persecuted <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/world/2015/06/09/intv-amanpour-selahattin-demirtas-coalition.cnn\">pro-Kurdish party</a> has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/01/27/middleeast/turkey-elections-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.  \n    </p>\n<p>In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.</p>\n<p>\n            “We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HDPenglish/status/1638870402364747776\">statement on March 23</a>. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.” \n    </p>\n<p>\n            It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/07/22/exp-ctw-selahattin-demirtas.cnn\">Selahattin Demirtas</a> has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Kemal Kilicdaroglu</a>, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media. \n    </p>\n<p>Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.</p>\n<p>“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”</p>\n<p>\n            Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">an ethnic minority</a> from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.  \n    </p>\n<p>The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.</p>\n<p>But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.</p>\n<p>Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.</p>\n<h2>Precarious position</h2>\n<p>The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.</p>\n<p>If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.</p>\n<p>“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.</p>\n<p>“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”</p>\n<p>The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”</p>\n<p>Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.</p>\n<p>Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.</p>\n<p>The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p>A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”</p>\n<p>Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>The digest </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            <strong>Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’ </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/middleeast/women-arrested-hijab-yogurt-iran-intl/index.html\">Two women were arrested</a> in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/04/03/man-throws-yogurt-on-women-iran-president-raisi-hijab-is-law-nada-bashir-ovn-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn\">showed footage of the man</a>approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters</i>: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/opec-production-cuts/index.html\">Oil prices spiked Monday</a> after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters:</i>The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond  </strong> \n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/kurdish-kingmaker-turkish-elections-mime-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.</p>\n    <p>Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.</p>\n    <p>A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”</p>\n    <p>\n            The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/spy-balloon-technology/index.html\">officials have said</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-balloon-tracking-method/index.html\">developed a method of tracking</a> what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n    </p>\n    <p>The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.</p>\n    <p>\n            CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-spy-balloon-collected-intelligence-us-military-bases-rcna77155\">first to report</a> on the new intelligence.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/politics/china-spy-balloon-us-latest/index.html\">eventually shot down</a> by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n    </p>\n    <p>A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”</p>\n    <p>Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”</p>\n    <p>The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/politics/us-tracking-china-spy-balloon/index.html\">reported</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe.

Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.</p>\n    <p>Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.</p>\n    <p>Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>\n            France is currently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/europe/france-pension-reform-protests-biarritz-airport-intl/index.html\">in the throes of a political and social crisis</a> triggered by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/macron-france-pension-no-confidence-intl/index.html\">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.</p>\n    <p>French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.</p>\n    <p>“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”</p>\n    <p>French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”</p>\n    <p>“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.</p>\n    <p>\n            Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/europe/sanna-marin-finland-partying-video-intl/index.html\">her partying</a> and her government’s public spending.\n    </p>\n    <p>While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.</p>\n    <p>The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.</p>\n    <p>Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.</p>\n    <p>Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.</p>\n    <p>Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230402171721-02-finland-election-petteri-orpo.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The National Coalition Chairman Petteri Orpo celebrates with supporters following the Finnish parliamentary elections, on April 2, 2023, in Helsinki.\"/>\n    <p>The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.</p>\n    <p>\n            Most notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/europe/ukraine\">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>That process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/sanna-marin-finland-elections-concedes-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The Biden administration managed to rack up a long list of major legislative wins in its first two years despite facing one of the most closely-divided Congresses in history.<br/>From bipartisan action on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html\">infrastructure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/senate-bipartisan-gun-bill/index.html\">gun safety</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html\">same-sex marriage</a> to party-line bills tackling <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/senate-democrats-climate-health-care-bill-vote/index.html\">climate change and expanding health care coverage</a>, it’s a record President Joe Biden and Democrats on the ballot were all eager to tout on the campaign trail during the midterms. \n    </p>\n<p>But far from the spotlight is a woman who helped make all that happen: Louisa Terrell.</p>\n<p>As the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, Terrell, 53, leads a team that is the president’s collective eyes and ears in Congress.</p>\n<p>“Making sure we’re responding, making sure we’re being proactive, figuring out what’s happening here in this building,” Terrell told CNN, explaining her job while standing in front of the Capitol, where she spends a considerable amount of time even though she works for the White House.</p>\n<p>She describes her role as a conductor for moving Biden’s agenda through Congress.</p>\n<p>“You want to be talking to committees, caucuses. Who’s talking to leadership? Who are the up-and-comers? What’s the floor action? What’s running quickly? What’s slowing down? And you need all these sort of tentacles out there, and then bringing that back every day.”</p>\n<p>But unlike an actual conductor who is front and center of an orchestra, Terrell operates very much behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>In fact, when we sat down for our conversation in the White House Executive Office Building, she said it was her first television interview – ever.</p>\n<p>Terrell’s years of experience in Washington have been critical to her success. She first started on the Hill over 20 years ago as a staffer for then-Sen. Biden on the Judiciary Committee. Looking back, she describes herself at the time as being just a “gal from Delaware,” in awe of the experienced legal clerks and seasoned staffers surrounding her. She quickly found her footing and thrived, going on to serve as Biden’s deputy chief of staff and later worked in the Obama administration’s Office of Legal Affairs – the very team she now leads.</p>\n<p>Even with her expansive resume, however, Terrell readily admits that today’s Washington is tougher to navigate than the one she first arrived in two decades ago.</p>\n<p>“The extremes have gotten extreme and I think that makes it harder,” she said. “You have to really work a lot harder to find where you can meet in the middle.”</p>\n<p>Being able to call on the personal relationships she’s forged over the years on Capitol Hill proved critical to working across the aisle to find that middle ground, particularly given Democrats’ razor-thin majorities.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be very clear on what the president’s position is and why we want to see what we want to see done,” she said of her conversations with Republican lawmakers. “Republicans know that when this White House – and whether it’s us on our team or a senior official – gives the word, then we stand by our word. And I think that kind of credibility on the Hill has been very important to move things.”</p>\n<p>Deep relationships matter too, she said.</p>\n<p>“You get fuel from the other people you work with. And I get an incredible amount of fuel from the senior team here at the White House and just people who have years and years of experience and relationships in those matters.”</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of work that can make or break a president, and even though it’s largely unheralded, that doesn’t mean it goes unnoticed. Following her confirmation to the Supreme Court as its first Black justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson included Terrell in her shout-outs as one of the “brilliant folks” who helped make the historic achievement possible.</p>\n<h2>A lifelong Biden connection</h2>\n<p>Terrell’s longest relationship in the White House is with the president himself. Though their professional relationship started when she came to Washington two decades ago, she first met Biden when she was just 5 years old.</p>\n<p>“I met Beau Biden in kindergarten,” Terrell, who is from Wilmington, recalled with a smile. “It (was) a very quick bike ride from my house to where Beau grew up. So we were childhood friends (and) stayed friends for … all our adulthood.”</p>\n<p>She remembers visiting the Biden household as a kid, sharing with CNN a running joke from her childhood.</p>\n<p>“When we would go to Beau’s house, there was a fax machine in the living room and all you needed to know (was), do not screw up the fax machine,” she says with a laugh. “And again, this is Delaware and it was probably the first fax machine in Delaware, this is high tech equipment.”</p>\n<p>Terrell’s lifelong relationship with the Biden family means she brings a unique perspective to her work in the White House.</p>\n<p>“He knows my folks and just being connected that way,” she said. “You know where the person came from and I think that helps.”</p>\n<p>“It brings a warmth to the work and I feel very, very lucky about that,” she added.</p>\n<p>\n            Terrell said her friend Beau, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/obit-vice-president-son-beau-biden/index.html\">died of a brain tumor in 2015</a>, is always on her mind.\n    </p>\n<p>“You want to represent what … the President wants you to do,” she said. “And then there’s always this other question of, what would Beau do? And I think of those things as kind of intertwined and they’re part of the background driver of how we do the work.”</p>\n<h2>Paying it forward for women</h2>\n<p>Two years into her work on the Judiciary Committee, Terrell became pregnant. She says Biden’s office maintained a family-first culture. But as she continued her career in Washington, her kids got a bit older, and the balancing act became more complicated.</p>\n<p>“I had the job in the Obama administration when my kids were say, like, around 6 and 8 – or 4 and 6. It’s all a little bit of a blur,” she joked.</p>\n<p>She describes her time after work as “bed, bath and beyond,” an entire “second shift” after a full day at the office. It’s something she’s extra mindful of now, as a senior woman in the administration.</p>\n<p>“I look across the White House, the women whose kids are that age, and you really have to (remember) how long their days and their nights are,” Terrell said. “And then to think about the kind of performance and the kind of 100% they’re giving at the office every day. I have so much gratitude and admiration.”</p>\n<p>Women having a seat at the table is not just a phrase in Terrell’s office. When CNN stopped by one of her team meetings in the West Wing, the room was packed with young staffers – mostly women. Terrell says that was a conscious decision, not because of their gender, but because they were the best for the job.</p>\n<p>“(The) expectation is, be ready to contribute. And that’s kind of what I mean – be prepared and ready to play,” she said of the more junior staff. “Don’t be afraid to do that.”</p>\n<p>But when asked what advice she would give to young women starting out in government today, Terrell didn’t hesitate.</p>\n<p>“I think that women today are way braver than I was,” she said. “It’s really impressive. So, I kind of think they don’t need my advice, actually, so, yeah, they don’t need me. I’m just happy to have drinks and coffee with them when they’ll take me,” she said with a laugh.</p>\n<h2>New challenges ahead</h2>\n<p>Terrell and her team are knee-deep in negotiations for the final weeks of a Democratic House majority, which means competing priorities for the rest of the lame duck session – the most important of which is Congress’ basic function of funding the government.</p>\n<p>As some Democrats tried to squeeze in legislation to regulate social media companies, Terrell’s stint at Facebook raised some questions among some advocacy groups, though Terrell maintains her stint at the tech giant 10 years ago doesn’t conflict with the president’s legislative agenda.</p>\n<p>“I think the president kind of came into office and campaigned on this about a very pro-competition, pro-accountability and pro-transparency in social media platforms, which obviously, what they are today is not what they were 10 years ago. So we worked really hard, I think, to promote those executive actions, the regulatory actions, the people that we brought into the administration to work on those, and worked hard on legislative pieces, and hope to continue to do that next year.”</p>\n<p>\n            And though the Democratic majority in the Senate will slightly expand in January, Terrell’s office is on the front lines preparing for Republicans to take over the House and launch a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/house-republicans-white-house-hunter-biden/index.html\">wave of congressional investigations into Biden officials</a>.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/politics/louisa-terrell-legislative-director/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kyrsten Sinema </a>decided to shake up the political world on Friday by becoming an independent. The former Democrat is still caucusing with the party in the Senate, so the Democratic caucus still has 51 members. Now, instead of 49 Democrats and two independents within their ranks, the caucus has 48 Democrats and three independents. \n    </p>\n    <p>But that simple math hides a more clouded picture for Democrats and for Sinema herself. Sinema’s interests are no longer necessarily the Democrats’ best interests in the next Congress, and the 2024 Senate map became even more complicated for Democrats with Sinema’s decision.</p>\n    <p>\n            To be clear, Sinema has always been a thorn in the Democrats side during her time in Congress. Over the last two years, Democrats have had to almost always make sure that any bill or nomination had Sinema’s support to have any chance of passing. That’s the math when you have only 50 Senate seats in a 100-seat chamber. A lot of bills and nominations <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2022/03/01/party-unity-vote-studies-underscore-polarized-state-of-the-union/\">were never voted on</a> without Sinema and Manchin’s backing. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            From 2013 (Sinema’s first term in Congress) to 2020, Sinema <a href=\"https://media.cq.com/votewatch/\">voted against her party </a>more than almost any other member of Congress. She stayed with the party about 69% of the time on votes where at least one half of the Democrats voted differently than half of Republicans. The average Democrat voted with their party about 90% of the time on these votes. \n    </p>\n    <p>It’s quite possible that Sinema’s percentage of sticking with the party will lower now that she is an independent. Consider the example of former Sen. Joe Lieberman. The longtime Democrat won reelection as a third-party candidate in 2006, after losing the Democratic primary to a left-wing challenger (the now fairly moderate Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont)</p>\n    <p>Relative to the average Senate Democrat, Lieberman voted with the party 10 points less of the time after becoming an independent than he had in his last term as a Democrat. If that happens with Sinema, she’ll become even more conservative than West Virginia’s Joe Manchin (the most conservative member of the Democratic caucus).</p>\n    <p>This would make sense because the incentive structure is now very different for Sinema. Ahead of a 2024 reelection campaign, she no longer has to worry about winning a Democratic primary. Sinema has to worry about building a coalition of Democrats, independents and Republicans. That is far more difficult to do if you’re seen as too liberal.</p>\n    <p>\n            Indeed, the big reason Sinema became an independent is because it would have been very difficult to win a Democratic primary. Her approval rating among Arizona Democrats in an<a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\"> autumn 2022 CES</a> poll stood at just 25%. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/09/sinema-party-arizona-senate-2024-00073301\">A number of Democrats</a> (e.g. Rep. Ruben Gallego and Rep. Greg Stanton) were already lining up to potentially challenge her in a primary. \n    </p>\n    <p>A question now is whether Sinema’s decision to become an independent will dissuade some of those Democrats from running. The idea being that Sinema still caucuses with the Democrats, and Democrats wouldn’t want to split the Democratic vote in a general election allowing a Republican to win in a purple state like Arizona.</p>\n    <p>It’s an interesting bet from Sinema. After all, Democrats usually don’t run a candidate against independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in Vermont. The Democrats who run against independent Sen. Angus King in Maine have not gained traction in recent elections. Don’t forget the aforementioned Lieberman won as a third-party candidate.</p>\n    <p>The electoral math structure was and is totally different in these circumstances, however. Sanders wouldn’t attract a left-wing Democratic challenger because he is already so progressive. Lieberman declared his third-party candidacy after the primary, so Republicans didn’t have time to find a well-known challenger. Republicans also knew that Lieberman, who was an ardent supporter of the Iraq War, was probably the best they could hope for in the deeply Democratic state of Connecticut.</p>\n    <p>This leaves the King example. King, like Sinema, is a moderate from not a deeply blue or red state. There’s just one problem for Sinema in this analogy: King is popular. He had previously won the governorship twice as an independent and has almost always sported high favorables.</p>\n    <p>\n            Sinema is not popular at all. The <a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\">CES poll</a> had her approval rating below her disapproval rating with Democrats, independents and Republicans in Arizona. Sinema’s overall approval stood at 25% to a disapproval rating of 58%. Other polling isn’t nearly as dire for Sinema, but the average of it all has her firmly being more unpopular than popular. \n    </p>\n    <p>Put another way, Sinema’s current numbers are probably not going to scare off many challengers from either the Democratic or Republican side. Additionally, there’s zero reason for Democrats to cede the ground to Sinema because it would keep a Republican from winning. It isn’t clear at all that Sinema can win as an independent.</p>\n    <p>What Sinema’s move did accomplish is that it made the electoral math a lot more complicated in Arizona and therefore nationally. Having two people in the race who are going to caucus with the Democratic Party likely makes it more difficult for the Democrats to win.</p>\n    <p>One potential worrisome example for Democrats in a purple state (at least then) was the 2010 Florida Senate race. Then Republican Gov. Charlie Crist decided to run as an independent after it became clear he wouldn’t beat the more conservative Republican Marco Rubio in a Republican primary. Crist, who said he would caucus with the Democrats, split the Democratic vote with then Rep. Kendrick Meek, and Rubio cruised to a win.</p>\n    <p>I should point out that Democrats certainly have a chance. The 1968 Alaska Senate race, for example, featured two Democrats (Mike Gravel and then Sen. Ernest Gruening as write-in). Gravel won in the state which Republican Richard Nixon carried, too, by a few points.</p>\n    <p>In 2024, Arizona Republicans could nominate an extreme candidate that flames out. They just lost every major statewide race in 2022 because of who they nominated.</p>\n    <p>\n            Don’t dismiss the possibility too that Sinema could win like Harry Byrd did in the <a href=\"https://vig.coopercenter.org/sites/vig/files/Virginia_News_Letter_1971_Vol._48_No._2.pdf\">1970 Virginia Senate election</a> when both parties nominated candidates. Maybe voters will like Sinema’s new independent registration. \n    </p>\n    <p>Sinema also could find herself flaming out when running in the general election without a major party backing her like Gruening did in 1968 or then Sen. Jacob Javits in the 1980 New York Senate race.</p>\n    <p>We just don’t know.</p>\n    <p>All that said, the Democrats already have a difficult map heading into 2024. Depending on whether the Democrats win the presidency (and have a Democratic vice president who can break Senate ties), they can afford to lose zero to one Senate seats and maintain a majority.</p>\n    <p>The vast majority, 23 of the 34, senators up for reelection in 2024 caucus with the Democrats. An abnormally large number (7) represent states Republican Donald Trump won at least once. This includes Arizona.</p>\n    <p>With Sinema’s break from the Democratic party, the road is, if nothing else, curvier for Democrats.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/politics/kyrsten-sinema-independent-democrats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He alleges a “witch hunt” against him. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.</p>\n<p>\n            Here’s an updated list of developments in Trump’s very complicated set of court cases, beginning with the one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23\">playing out in Manhattan</a> this week.\n    </p>\n<h2>New York state civil court: $250 million fraud case</h2>\n<p>The civil fraud trial, unlike Trump’s multiple criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.</p>\n<p>\n            New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/letitia-james-trump-lawsuit-takeaways-what-to-know/index.html\">$250 million lawsuit</a> in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Judge Arthur Engoron <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/trump-organization-business-fraud/index.html\">has already ruled</a> that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.\n    </p>\n<p>The trial portion of the case, playing out in court in Manhattan, will assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron’s decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out.</p>\n<h2>Federal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit</h2>\n<p>\n            In May, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawsuit-battery-defamation-verdict/index.html\">a federal jury in Manhattan found</a> Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            A separate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-defamation-lawsuit/index.html\">civil defamation lawsuit</a> will only need to decide how much money Trump has to pay her. That case for January 15 – the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.\n    </p>\n<h2>Federal criminal court in DC: 2020 election Interference</h2>\n<p>\n            In August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel/index.html\">special counsel Jack Smith</a>’s investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty. \n    </p>\n<p>The case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>\n            In late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/27/politics/tanya-chutkan-donald-trump-recusal-motion/index.html\">rejected Trump’s request</a> that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters’ prison sentences.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Chutkan set the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/politics/trump-january-6-criminal-case-trial-date-hearing/index.html\">trial’s start date</a> for March 4, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump’s criminal cases expected to proceed. \n    </p>\n<h2>New York criminal court: Hush money payments</h2>\n<p>Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>\n            The former president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/politics/donald-trump-arraignment-new-york/index.html\">pleaded not guilty</a> at his April arraignment in Manhattan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Prosecutors, led by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/politics/alvin-bragg-manhattan-district-attorney-trump/index.html\">Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a>, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.\n    </p>\n<p>Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.</p>\n<p>\n            The trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free </i><i>here</i><i>. </i>\n</p>\n    <p>\n            Let’s start with the positive: Republicans and Democrats are coming together to protect same-sex<strong> </strong>marriage from the Supreme Court. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The Respect for Marriage Act<strong> </strong>codifies marriages and came about amid worries among Democrats that the same conservative majority on the Supreme Court that took away the right to abortion will target same-sex marriage in the future.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The version that overcame a filibuster in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html\">passed the Senate Tuesday</a>. A dozen Republican senators from across the country voted with Democrats before Thanksgiving to limit debate and move toward a final vote. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/senate-republicans-vote-same-sex-marriage\">RELATED: Meet the 12 Republicans who voted to consider the Respect for Marriage Act</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>It next goes to the House for approval before President Joe Biden can sign it into law.</p>\n    <p>But there is a fair amount of fine print.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>First, the bill does not require all states to allow same-sex marriage,</strong> even though that is the current reality under the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Rather, if the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell and previous state prohibitions on same-sex marriage came back into effect, the Respect for Marriage Act would require states and the federal government to respect marriages conducted in places where it is legal.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>There are religious exceptions. </strong>Republican supporters have emphasized the elements in this Senate version that protect nonprofit and religious organizations from having to provide support for same-sex marriages.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I will be supporting the substitute amendment because it will ensure our religious freedoms are upheld and protected, one of the bedrocks of our democracy,” said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito <a href=\"https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-votes-to-advance-consideration-of-the-respect-for-marriage-act-plans-to-support-substitute-amendment\">in a statement</a> after helping break the filibuster.\n    </p>\n    <p>It took months of behind-the-scenes effort to bring 10-plus Republicans on board.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>This is all academic right now.</strong> The bill is only being passed in case the now-solidly conservative Supreme Court, which has taken delight in upending precedent, were to revisit the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that created a national right to marriage for same-sex couples.\n    </p>\n    <p>Two of the justices who voted in favor of that ruling have been replaced by Republican-appointed conservatives, which means that if the case were heard today, there’s a real likelihood it would be decided differently.</p>\n    <p>\n            While Justice Samuel Alito seemed to want to wall off the abortion rights precedent upended by the Supreme Court earlier this year, CNN’s Ariane de Vogue has written about how the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization could affect issues like marriage. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/politics/roe-alito-obergefell-loving\">Read her story</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A complete 180 in Congress</h2>\n    <p>\n            Despite the fine print, it is almost unbelievable that less than<strong> </strong>a generation ago, Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president in the ’90s, worked together to protect the “institution of marriage” from same-sex unions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, it’s Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president, working together to protect same-sex marriage from a government institution.</p>\n    <p>\n            During that time, public support for same-sex marriage grew from about a quarter of the public in the year the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx\">71% in Gallup polling this year</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The issue has played a role in multiple US elections, including, arguably, the one that just took place.</p>\n    <p>\n            Here’s a brief history of marriage equality playing a role in prior<strong> </strong>election years:\n    </p>\n    <h2>26 years ago, there was united opposition</h2>\n    <p>In 1996, Republican majorities in the House and Senate sensed a political opening after then-President Bill Clinton failed to allow gay people to openly serve in the military.</p>\n    <p>\n            They were also trying to get ahead of a Hawaii court decision that could have legalized same-sex marriage in that state. Fearing every state might have to recognize same-sex unions, Republicans pushed the Defense of Marriage Act,<strong> </strong>known as DOMA. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            It declared marriage as between one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize marriages. It also<strong> </strong>withheld federal benefits from married same-sex couples. In 2013, a part of DOMA<strong> </strong>was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/26/politics/scotus-same-sex-doma/index.html\">found to be unconstitutional</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            DOMA had broad approval. Democrats like then-Sen. Biden <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1042/vote_104_2_00280.htm\">voted for the bill</a>. Current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and many other Democrats whose names you’d recognize, were among the 342 who voted for the bill in the House. \n    </p>\n    <p>Current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the 67 members to vote “no,” along with then-Rep. Steve Gunderson, who at the time was the House’s only out gay Republican.</p>\n    <h2>18 years ago, Republicans used opposing gay marriage to their advantage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2004,<strong> </strong>placing anti-gay-marriage amendments on ballots in key states like Ohio was smart politics. It helped George W. Bush win reelection to the White House and the GOP gain seats in the US Senate. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Bush <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/25/elec04.prez.bush.marriage/index.html\">endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage</a>. The Democratic candidate, John Kerry, also opposed same-sex marriage at the time. \n    </p>\n    <h2>14 years ago, Democrat Barack Obama opposed gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2008,<strong> </strong>even as more in his party began to publicly support marriage equality, Obama continued his opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He has more recently said and written that he always personally supported same-sex marriage<strong> </strong>rights. His campaign aide David Axelrod has written that Obama made a calculated decision to oppose gay marriage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “He grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ‘sacred union,’” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/10/politics/obama-gay-marriage-axelrod/index.html\">Axelrod wrote </a>in a memoir.\n    </p>\n    <h2>10 years ago, Obama made the political calculation to support gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2012,<strong> </strong>following the lead of then-Vice President Biden, Obama officially evolved on the issue and said he now supported marriage equality. It was a big<strong> </strong>moment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A few years later, in 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling/index.html\">Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>5 years ago, Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to publicly support marriage equality</h2>\n    <p>\n            “I’m fine with it,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.html\">Trump said </a>in 2016 during an interview with “60 Minutes.” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He’d go on to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/politics/we-count-new-hampshire/\">brag about </a>being a champion for gay rights, although many LGBTQ activists would disagree.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Now, completing the transformation</h2>\n    <p>The politicians of the ’90s have largely evolved with the country.</p>\n    <p>\n            But this summer,<strong> </strong>one of the Supreme Court’s relics from the ’90s, Justice Clarence Thomas, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/abortion-ruling-gay-rights-contraceptives/index.html\">questioned the 2015 marriage decision</a> he opposed. As a result, Republicans and Democrats have come together again to undo what they did in 1996 and try to guarantee marriage as a right for all Americans.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/respect-for-marriage-act-what-matters/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
