Over the last week, the token has risen by 9%, signaling stronger interest from traders.</p><p>On the 12-hour chart, PENGU had broken out above a descending channel that had kept prices moving lower since late July. The breakout was confirmed as $0.032 held as support during the retest. Fibonacci levels suggest next targets around $0.047, $0.064, and $0.076, with extended projections pointing toward $0.096 if <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pengu-primed-for-liftoff-bullish-retest-signals-180-move-ahead/\">momentum continues</a>.

Bitcoinsensus noted,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$PENGU</a>Bullish Flag in Play!<p>After strong accumulation, price formed a massive flagpole</p><p>Now consolidating inside a bullish flag channel</p><p>Breakout target sits around $0.074 — momentum could send it flying</p><a href=\"\">#PENGU</a><a href=\"\">#Crypto</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/WhLBjh1C3W</a><p>— Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus)</p><a href=\"\">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote><p>At current levels near $0.037, that would mean more than doubling in price if the breakout confirms.</p><p>In addition, Momentum readings align with the bullish setup. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has flipped positive, pointing to building strength on the upside.</p><p>The Stochastic RSI is trending higher at 78 and 66, close to the overbought range.

She embodies what Origin Summit is about: visionary IP with global reach, creative integrity, and cultural relevance,” said SY Lee, co-founder and CEO of Story. “We’re beyond excited to have her as part of the event, because K-POP DEMON HUNTERS showcases the full spectrum of what IP can be. It’s a global cultural movement. It drives music charts, sparks fandoms, inspires merchandise, and reshapes how stories move through the world. That’s the kind of programmable, participatory IP future we’re building toward.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Origin Summit </strong>is the premier institutional event at the intersection of AI, blockchain, finance, and intellectual property.

PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network.</p><blockquote><p>“Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.”</p></blockquote><p>This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains.</p><p>The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high.</p><p>This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide</p><p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p><p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p><p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.”</p><p><a href=\"https://tron.network/\">TRONNetwork</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.org/\"> TRONDAO</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/TRONDAO\">X</a> |<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\"> YouTube</a> |<a href=\"https://t.me/tronnetworkEN\"> Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/trondao\">Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/\"> Reddit</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/tronprotocol\"> GitHub</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.medium.com/\"> Medium</a> |<a href=\"https://forum.trondao.org/\"> Forum</a></p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-usd-expands-to-tron-network-via-layerzero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin’s current stability near $117,500 is being shaped almost entirely by retail investors, according to Binance’s latest trading data.</p><p>Inflows show that smaller transactions dominate.</p><h2>Retail Traders Dominate BTC</h2><p>In its latest report, CryptoQuant <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb7efd6e8c203d2e216927-Binance-Data-Bitcoin-Steadies-Near-117500-as-Retail-Inflows-Dominate-and-Whales-\">revealed</a> that inflows of 0-0.001 BTC recorded nearly 97,000 BTC, and those in the 0.001-0.01 BTC range amounted to about 719,000 BTC. This breakdown highlighted the retail-driven nature of the market, where numerous small contributions are providing liquidity and balance.</p><p>Despite the relatively modest size of these inflows, their collective weight has been sufficient to keep Bitcoin steady at the current levels. At the same time, the absence of large whale inflows, specifically transactions of 100 BTC or more, is notable. This lack of large-wallet activity indicates that the market is not being swayed by concentrated buying power but instead by broader retail participation.</p><p>On the positive side, such a pattern reduces the immediate risk of a sharp downturn often associated with whale selling, and gives Bitcoin a firmer footing in the short term. However, the dependence on retail activity also highlights a structural fragility since, if enthusiasm among smaller investors wanes or if whales suddenly re-enter with significant inflows, the market could face abrupt volatility.</p><p>For now, the balance between consistent retail inflows and muted whale activity has created a period of relative calm, which has allowed Bitcoin to consolidate near its highs. If this trend continues, the market could gradually build momentum toward testing the $120,000 level.</p><p>Despite this, there is still the looming possibility of whale intervention, which is capable of either accelerating upward momentum or triggering a rapid correction.</p><h2>Supportive Setup</h2><p>The retail flows come in the backdrop of the US Federal Reserve making the first interest rate cut for 2025.</p><p>Kushal Manupati of Binance said the 25 bp cut creates a supportive setup for crypto, which would <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">boost</a> BTC, ETH, and potentially large-cap alts if funding and ETF inflows remain stable. In a statement to <i>CryptoPotato</i>, the exec said</p><blockquote><p>“In crypto, that setup typically sustains demand for BTC and ETH and can expand to high-quality large-cap alts if funding and futures basis remain stable. Watch ETF inflows and on-exchange depth; if those stay firm, market breadth should improve rather than fade.</p><p>From here, labor and inflation data will determine whether another cut is likely this year or whether the Fed pauses. If Fed communication stays consistent, cross-border participation should increase across trading sessions.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/retail-traders-keep-bitcoin-floating-above-117k-but-one-whale-move-could-change-everything/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The signal occurs when the blue %K line moves above the orange %D line from the oversold zone.</p><p>Analyst Ash Crypto commented,</p><blockquote><p>BTC WEEKLY STOCHASTIC RSI HAS CROSSED UP, CONFIRMING A STRONG BULLISH SIGNAL</p><p>EVERY TIME THIS SIGNAL CAME IN THE PAST, BTC WAS OVERSOLD AND THEN PUMPED UP.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/4nRSG2c0AX</a><p>— Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>Similar crossovers were recorded in September 2023, January 2024, September 2024, and March 2025. Each time, Bitcoin followed with a sustained rise. The latest crossover appeared on September 8, 2025, with BTC trading near $117,600.</p><h2>Resistance Levels to Watch</h2><p>Bitcoin is now testing resistance around $119,000–$119,500, an area that has capped price advances in recent months. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe <a href=\"https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1968594485593489492\">remarked</a>,</p><blockquote><p>“The more important part; will $BTC break through this crucial resistance zone?”</p></blockquote><p>Failure to push higher could bring BTC back toward $114,700, or even $111,900, which traders see as a possible entry zone. A clean break above $119,500 would open the way to $123,288, the most recent high where liquidity was taken.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1HaPtuXcAEM3N0.jpg\"><graphic class=\"wp-image-413029 size-full\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjAwIDkyNyIgd2lkdGg9IjEyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iOTI3IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFIYVB0dVhjQUVNM04wLmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIxMjAwIiBkYXRhLWg9IjkyNyIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"Bitcoin (BTC) price chart\" width=\"1200\" height=\"927\"/></a></p><h2>The $117,200 Pivot</h2><p>Analyst Ted pointed to $117,200 as a level to watch. Bitcoin was rejected here earlier, sending it below $115,000. He noted,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$BTC</a>is trying to reclaim the $117,200 level.<p>It got rejected the other day, which led to a correction below $115,000.</p><p>If BTC is able to reclaim this level, a move towards $120,000 will happen.</p><p>If Bitcoin fails to reclaim this, a dump towards $113,000 could happen.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/y2aTrWojIw</a><p>— Ted (@TedPillows)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>In the chart, a breakout beyond $117,200 could move prices toward $120,000–$123,300. Conversely, a decrease in <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-bulls-eye-137k-but-only-if-this-support-holds-strong/\">momentum</a> would expose the support areas around $113,600–$114,000 with further downside toward $107,400–$108,600 and $101,000–$102,000.</p><p>In addition, Ted also <a href=\"https://x.com/TedPillows/status/1968646687121113517\">commented</a> on the broader cycle, saying, “BTC has historically peaked 1,070–1,080 days after bottom. This time, I’m expecting a longer cycle due to institutional arrival.” He suggested a possible peak in January or February 2026.</p><p>Analysts feel Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture: either confirming a breakout over resistance zones or <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/2-worrying-signs-for-bitcoin-btc-despite-the-expected-rate-cuts/\">retreating</a> to test lower levels once more.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Ethereum’s mid-sized whale cohort is sitting on massive paper gains, reaching levels not seen since the network’s last market peak almost four years ago.</p><p>Analyst CryptoOnchain has shared data showing wallets with between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH seeing unrealized profits rise to cycle highs, a sign that historically came right before selling pressure increased.</p><h2>Whale Wallet Profits Mirror Previous Market Top</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb10c16e8c203d2e2168c4-ETH-Unrealized-Profits-of-Mid-Sized-Whales-Hit-Levels-Last-Seen-at-ATH-in-Nov-20\">analysis</a>, this uptick in unrealized profits among average-sized whales highlights a stage in the cycle where investor psychology can significantly shape price action.</p><p>In previous instances, including the 2021 peak, such levels coincided with either large-scale profit-taking or, at a minimum, heightened selling pressure. While the data does not guarantee an imminent correction, it suggests that the market has entered a zone where whale decisions could dictate Ethereum’s near-term trajectory.</p><blockquote><p>“This does not necessarily mean an immediate correction,” wrote CryptoOnchain. “It highlights a critical stage in the cycle where investor psychology and whale behavior could heavily influence price action.”</p></blockquote><p>The timing of these gains is also notable. Ethereum has rallied more than 95% in the last year and 8.7% over the past month, and was trading at $4,591 at the time of this writing, just 6.9% below its record high of $4,946.</p><p>Furthermore, in the last week, ETH has oscillated between $4,404 and $4,762, with intraday swings between $4,440 and $4,637 in the past 24 hours. This ideally puts whales in a position of strength, as many of them accumulated at significantly lower levels during Ethereum’s consolidation phase.</p><p>Still, the market backdrop is complicating the whale picture. For example, as chartist Ali Martinez reported previously, big investors <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/90000-eth-in-just-2-days-is-ethereum-headed-for-a-big-correction/\">sold</a> 90,000 ETH worth more than $400 million in just 48 hours, leaving them with only 15.4 million tokens. Those moves may have been opportunistic profit-taking before yesterday’s Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">meeting</a>, but they also showed how quickly whale actions can change the market if sentiment turns.</p><h2>Institutional Signals and Price Trajectory</h2><p>Renewed institutional participation is also helping offset the risk of whale-driven sell-offs. Evidence of this was provided by CQ analyst PelinayPA on September 17, who highlighted that Ethereum’s Fund Market Premium (FMP), which compares futures prices to spot prices, has been steadily <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68caaaef756c0b23f07c4e61-Ethereum-Fund-Market-Premium-Signals-Strong-Institutional-Support-Above-68K\">rising</a> since July. That trend shows that institutional buyers are willing to pay more than the current price for exposure, which is often seen as a sign of long-term rallies.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the charts, ETH remains pinned below the $4,850 resistance level after months of climbing within a steep ascending channel, as <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis-can-eth-push-toward-5k-as-bullish-momentum-returns/\">noted</a> in <i>CryptoPotato’s </i>latest pulse check. The asset continues to print higher highs and higher lows, supported by a bullish moving-average crossover, yet momentum is fading as traders await a breakout.</p><p>If whales decide to lock in profits, ETH could revisit the $4,000 zone. But if they hold, or if institutions absorb the selling, analysts see a realistic chance of the altcoin breaking above $5,000 before the month’s end.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-mid-sized-whales-see-unrealized-profits-soar-to-2021-ath-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p><ul><li>The launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), described as a “spot ETF with extras,” has been among the most talked-about topics in the crypto community recently.</li><li>Ripple also teamed up with Franklin Templeton and DBS Bank, enabling trading between its RLUSD stablecoin and Franklin’s tokenized money market fund sgBENJI.</li></ul><h2>Breaking News Today</h2><p>Ripple has taken center stage lately, mainly due to the developments on the ETF front. As <i>CryptoPotato</i> <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-etf-launch-imminent-latest-updates-revealed/\">reported</a>, the REX-Osprey XRP exchange-traded fund (under the ticker XRPR) is scheduled for launch today (September 18).</p><p>While the issuer described the investment vehicle as a spot ETF, some industry participants identified features that distinguish it from other such products. The popular Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett claimed it will operate as a “spot ETF with extras.”</p><blockquote><p>“To my understanding, it’s a spot product in a ’40 Act wrapper that holds real XRP plus cash, Treasuries, and some derivatives. Basically a spot ETF with extras, and is more regulated than traditional spot products,” she said.</p></blockquote><p>Contrary to the upcoming product, spot crypto ETFs that have already been approved in the United States are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which governs commodity-based trusts. For a detailed breakdown of how REX-Osprey’s ETF compares to standard spot ETFs, please read our article <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-stalls-xrp-and-doge-etf-rollout-how-they-differ-from-btc-and-eth-counterparts/\">here</a>.</p><p>Grayscale has also displayed its intentions to introduce a product that tracks the performance of numerous cryptocurrencies, including XRP.</p><p>Earlier today, CEO Peter Mintzberg <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-approves-grayscales-digital-large-cap-fund-for-trading/\">said</a> the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards. He also added that the team is working “expeditiously” to launch the first multi-crypto asset ETP with BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA as underlying assets. </p><p>The GDLC is specifically designed to give investors exposure to some of the biggest cryptocurrencies, without requiring them to buy and store the coins themselves directly. It will track the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and will operate with daily cash creation and redemption of 10,000-share baskets.</p><h2>Ripple’s Prestigious Partnership</h2><p>In addition to the breaking ETF news, the company <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-dbs-bank-franklin-templeton-tap-xrp-ledger-to-launch-tokenized-repo-markets/\">shook hands</a> with the global investment company Franklin Templeton (which has over $1.6 trillion in assets under management) and the leading bank in Singapore, DBS Bank. </p><p>According to the signed memorandum of understanding (MoU), the financial institution will list sgBENJ and RLUSD. The former is a tokenized version of Franklin Templeton’s US dollar money market fund, while the latter is Ripple’s stablecoin, which is pegged to the greenback.</p><blockquote><p>“With this setup, eligible DBS clients can trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, enabling them to rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the official announcement reads.</p></blockquote><p>In the next phase of the collaboration, the Singaporean bank plans to explore helping clients unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/big-day-for-ripple-and-xrp-etfs-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Below that, the next range sits between $2.33 and $2.00. This zone acted as a strong base earlier in the year and may do so again if tested.</p><h2>Google Partnership Adds Fuel</h2><p>Recent developments around the SUI network have drawn attention to the project.

Therefore, investors’ fears are alleviated, and the market is likely to rally further in the coming weeks.</p><p>By Shayan</p><h2>The Daily Chart</h2><p>Bitcoin’s daily chart demonstrates a clear bounce from the $107K demand zone and a rise back above the 100-day moving average, located around the $113K mark. After yesterday’s Fed rate cut, the asset is continuing its path toward the $124K supply zone, which aligns with the current BTC all-time high.</p><p>The RSI is also trending above the 50% level, indicating that the momentum has now shifted bullish once again. All these signals point to a potential continuation toward the $124K ATH and likely a further rally toward $130K and even higher.</p><h2>The 4-Hour Chart</h2><p>As the 4-hour chart demonstrates, Bitcoin’s recent rally has occurred after the price successfully broke out of a descending channel, following a swift double bottom rebound at the $108K supply zone.</p><p>The asset has now swept the liquidity pool above the previous $107K high, which can lead to two possible scenarios. The market can either carry on with the uptrend and attack the $124K area once again, or it can pull back at least to the $112K order block, which is the most notable demand zone nearby. Yet, with the RSI still below the overbought region, the price seemingly has more room to grow before a correction occurs.</p><h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2><h3>Open Interest</h3><p>This chart displays the Bitcoin aggregate open interest, which shows the number of open perpetual futures positions. Typically, during bullish market conditions, this metric climbs higher or consolidates, as more and more traders are taking leveraged positions. This is exactly what can be seen on the chart.</p><p>Meanwhile, another interesting observation is that even with the market going through a short-term correction a few weeks ago, the open interest has yet to drop. While this is generally a bullish sign, it also points to the fact that the futures market might still be overheated. Therefore, there is still the probability for a liquidation cascade to happen in the short term, which could cause a flash crash before the market stabilizes again.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pl/bybit24/\">Use this link</a>to register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!<p>Disclaimer: Information found on CryptoPotato is those of writers quoted.
