The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?</p>\n    <p>Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.</p>\n    <p>But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week.</p>\n    <p>They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.</p>\n    <p>The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.</p>\n    <p>And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.</p>\n    <p>After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.</p>\n    <p>But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.</p>\n    <p>There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.</p>\n    <p>Now, here's the important twist.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.</p>\n    <p>But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.</p>\n    <p>The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4dca/live/eb7bf820-93d6-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far. Each year is represented by a line which tracks the numbers from January to December. 2021 saw the lowest of the five years, at 28,526 and 2022 saw the highest with 45,774. As at 8 September the total for 2025 is 30,164 which is the highest for that point in the year of any of the others.\"/>\n    <p>It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win.</p>\n    <p>But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.</p>\n    <p>That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.</p>\n    <p>If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.</p>\n    <p>So where does this decision leave the project?</p>\n    <p>This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.</p>\n    <p>Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.</p>\n    <p>But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.</p>\n    <p>The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".</p>\n    <p>Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road.</p>\n    <p>If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.</p>\n    <p>The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.</p>\n    <p>It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.</p>\n    <p>Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST).</p>\n    <p>Many Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey.

She is photographed over the shoulder of the journalist, and is wearing a black and green patterned top. \"/>\n    <p>There is no set definition of not proven in law. At the start of a criminal trial, jurors are told that there are two acquittal verdicts - but it is not explained how they differ.</p>\n    <p>Justice Secretary Angela Constance said it was a \"widely misunderstood\" verdict that \"traumatises\" victims and leaves a \"lingering stigma on the accused\".</p>\n    <p>However, the Law Society of Scotland has argued that its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice.</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-49972637\">study published in 2019</a> said removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. </p>\n    <p>It also highlighted inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty.</p>\n    <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/criminal-proceedings-scotland-2022-23/pages/6/\">Scottish government figures</a>, for 2022/23, show that 1% of people facing criminal charges in court were acquitted on a not proven verdict, compared to 4% on a not guilty verdict.</p>\n    <p>The reforms in the government's bill also include a change in how guilty verdicts are decided.</p>\n    <p>Scottish juries have 15 members and at present a simple majority of eight jurors is required for a verdict. Under the new two-thirds rule, that will be raised to 10 out of 15 jurors.</p>\n    <p>Raising the bar for guilty verdicts is intended to allay the concerns of some defence lawyers who fear the the abolition of the not proven verdict could increase the risk of wrongful convictions.</p>\n    <p>The reforms also pave the way for:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>the creation of a special sexual offences court, including \"trauma-informed\" training for judges and legal staff</li>\n      <li>a victims and witnesses commissioner - an independent office answerable to parliament that would be in charge of ensuring standards of care</li>\n      <li>a requirement for the parole board to consider if a murderer has refused to reveal the location of their victim's remains when considering if they should be freed from jail, and to take into account the safety of victims and their families</li>\n      <li>the extension of rules that restrict what can be said in court about a complainer's sexual history</li>\n      <li> a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn3n3ddlmkgo\">trial scheme</a>giving victims of rape and serious sexual assault free access to court transcripts to be made permanent</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Ministers have not set a timetable for scrapping the not proven verdict or introducing a two-thirds majority for guilty verdicts.</p>\n    <p>These changes will require judges and court staff to undergo training.</p>\n    <p>It could take significantly longer to set up a sexual offences court and a victims commissioner.</p>\n    <p>Most rape cases reported to police do not lead to prosecutions. To address this, ministers proposed a pilot scheme that would have allowed trials for serious sexual offences to be held without a jury and decided by a single judge.</p>\n    <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20n3rjp7v9o\">this measure was dropped</a> following criticism from lawyers and judges.</p>\n    <h2>'Compassion, dignity and justice'</h2>\n    <p>Victim Support Scotland chief executive Kate Wallace said the passage of the bill was a \"momentous occasion\".</p>\n    <p>\"It marks a significant step towards creating a system that considers and prioritises the needs of people impacted by crime,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Rape Crisis chief executive Sandy Brindley welcomed the removal of the not proven verdict, which she said had \"let down\" victims.</p>\n    <p>However, she also expressed \"serious concerns\" about the increase to the jury majority and \"the negative effect that this will almost certainly have on rape and sexual offence cases\".</p>\n    <p>The Law Society of Scotland said it supported the creation of a victims commissioner and the granting of automatic lifelong anonymity for victims of sexual offences.</p>\n    <p>But it warned that introducing \"untested\" changes to the justice system could raise the risk of miscarriages of justice.</p>\n    <p>Stuart Munro, convener of the society's Criminal Law Committee, said: \"Every legal system with a two-verdict system requires a unanimous or near unanimous jury to convict, whereas Scotland will now have a system where a person can be convicted despite five members of the jury having significant doubts about their guilt.\"</p>\n    <p>The bill was supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs.</p>\n    <p>Constance said the legislation would \"put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system\".</p>\n    <p>Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman told MSPs it would help deliver \"compassion, dignity and justice for victims\".</p>\n    <p>While there was broad agreement in parliament over abolishing the not proven verdict, Conservative and Labour MSPs voted against the bill.</p>\n    <p>They raised objections to pushing through such a wide range of measures in one bill and being given limited time to debate complex amendments.</p>\n    <p>Tory MSP Sharon Dowry said the legislation would \"waste millions on cosmetic solutions that will make little difference to victims\".</p>\n    <p>Labour justice spokeswoman Pauline McNeill raised concerns about taking serious sexual offence cases out of the high court and into a specialist court.</p>\n    <p>Her colleague Katy Clark added that the bill was \"far too large\" and that several amendments received too little scrutiny.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8rndyyp7vo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty.</p>\n    <p>Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said Robinson <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99g1e0z2ero\">had sent text messages</a> which allegedly said he shot Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\".</p>\n    <p>Before Robinson was captured, top Trump allies pinned blame for the killing on left-wing activists and rhetoric from Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.</p>\n    <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has suggested that the administration will crack down on \"hate speech\" – although there is no specific US hate speech law. Vice-President JD Vance has led calls to expose people who celebrated or condoned Kirk's killing or were critical of him after his slaying.</p>\n    <p>\"Call them out, and hell, call their employer,\" <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0r5y33pj5o\">Vance said</a> as he guest-hosted Kirk's podcast.</p>\n    <p>Speaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Obama said: \"I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together.\"</p>\n    <p>He urged Americans to \"respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with\".</p>\n    <p>Obama praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox, a conservative Republican who he said had shown \"that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate\".</p>\n    <p>He also endorsed the response of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, whose official residence was firebombed earlier this year in what police called a targeted attack.</p>\n    <p>The former president contrasted those reactions with comments made by Trump and his allies.</p>\n    <p>Obama said that he did not use a 2015 mass shooting by a white supremacist at a black church in South Carolina to go after his political enemies, and pointed out that after the 11 September 2001 attacks, President George W Bush \"explicitly went out of his way to say, 'We are not at war against Islam'.\"</p>\n    <p>\"And so when I hear not just our current president, but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents 'vermin', enemies who need to be 'targeted,' that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now and something that we're going to have to grapple with, all of us,\" Obama told the crowd, according to reports.</p>\n    <p>In a statement to the BBC, a White House spokesperson rejected the allegations and accused Obama of stoking division while he was president.</p>\n    <p>\"Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other,\" the spokesperson said.</p>\n    <p>\"His division has inspired generations of Democrats to slander their opponents as 'deplorables,' or 'fascists,' or 'Nazis.'\"</p>\n    <p>After leaving office, US presidents generally tend to temper criticism of their successors, however in recent months Obama has hit out at Trump's moves against universities and judges, and has also criticised Democratic party leaders for failing to push back harder against White House policies.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dxge2ep4xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.</p>\n    <p>At the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.</p>\n    <p>She did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\".</p>\n    <p>\"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\"</p>\n    <p>\"But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgly78j5ny8o\">Did democratic opposition in Russia die with Alexei Navalny?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68336393\">Russian opposition leader's 'principled and fearless' widow</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>She added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and \"a symbol of hope for a better future for our country\".</p>\n    <p>\"I know he was a symbol to you too,\" she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend.</p>\n    <p>\"I will not be silent.

When he was taken back to his cell \"he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting\".</p>\n    <p>\"Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window,\" she said, citing the alleged testimonies.</p>\n    <p>An ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced \"sudden death syndrome\". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.</p>\n    <p>Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68595334\">briefly referred to him a month after his death</a> by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".</p>\n    <p>The Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia.</p>\n    <p>\"But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it,\" Putin said.</p>\n    <p>It is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death.</p>\n    <p>His popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption.</p>\n    <p>With Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule.</p>\n    <p>Many of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia.

I'm me.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm a very independent, strong-minded, effective politician in my own right.\"</p>\n    <p>She said she might have been sacked as Commons leader in Sir Keir's reshuffle for telling the Labour leadership things \"they didn't want to hear\" such as how deeply MPs opposed welfare cuts.</p>\n    <p>If she were elected deputy leader she said she would be a \"conduit\" for the views of members and tell Sir Keir \"when we're getting things wrong\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to the Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, she said she did not want a cabinet job if she succeeded, adding that Sir Keir had been \"really clear\" that David Lammy would be Rayner's replacement as deputy PM.</p>\n    <p>As a \"full-time deputy leader\", she said she would aim to bridge the gap between party members and the leadership.</p>\n    <p>Launching her bid for the deputy leadership, Phillipson urged Labour to remain united to win a second term in government.</p>\n    <p>\"I won't pretend this government hasn't made mistakes – I've been first to admit it\" she told supporters in her Sunderland constituency.</p>\n    <p>\"But we can't afford to look inwards - to go back to bad old days of divided Labour Party and open old wounds.</p>\n    <p>\"If we turn against each other only one person will win – [Reform UK leader] Nigel Farage - but millions more will lose.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>You can hear the full interview with Lucy Powell on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson </strong>\n      <strong>on BBC Sounds</strong>\n      <strong>.

So, we'll talk to them.\"</p>\n    <p>His comments will be welcomed by Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, who said that tariff relief for British steel is being negotiated.</p>\n    <p>Senior government sources insist there \"remains a path to zero\".</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is \"no mere pageant\" and warned the government that \"we can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past\".</p>\n    <p>An agreement to reduce the tariffs to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July.</p>\n    <p>At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as \"devastating\".</p>\n    <p>However, industry sources told the BBC on Tuesday that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%.</p>\n    <p>One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry.</p>\n    <p>One UK steel producer told the BBC they were \"furious\" about the situation.</p>\n    <p>The company, which has US customers and saw opportunities to increase exports to the country, said it would now struggle to compete with a price advantage over American steel producers.</p>\n    <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.\"</p>\n    <p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UK's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027.</p>\n    <p>The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress.

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.</p>\n    <p>The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.</p>\n    <p>In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was \"an interim judgement on one individual\" which would not halt the deal.</p>\n    <p>\"It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,\" Kendall said.</p>\n    <p>She said ministers never claimed the deal would be \"a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems\" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.</p>\n    <p>Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.</p>\n    <p>\"There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.\"</p>\n    <p>The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.</p>\n    <p>But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had \"very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals\".</p>\n    <p>Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.</p>\n    <p>Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be \"quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats\".</p>\n    <p>She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was \"worth it to have due process and a fair system\".</p>\n    <p>\"It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],\" Townley said.</p>\n    <p>She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an \"overarching problem\" with the scheme's design.</p>\n    <p>Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with \"we told you so\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for \"some tough laws\" and said \"we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country\".</p>\n    <p>Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as \"one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel\".</p>\n    <p>Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.</p>\n    <p>A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.</p>\n    <p>More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.</p>\n    <p>It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea8/live/2959ad80-9338-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far.

its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,\" Mr Huang told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but \"what's missing is the AI infrastructure,\" adding: \"We are here to build it.\"</p>\n    <p>AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of \"building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally.\"</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity.</p>\n    <p>\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,\" he told the BBC.</p>\n    <p>\"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs \"putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom\".</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p>But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst.</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be \"over-hyped or under-hyped\".</p>\n    <p>He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\".</p>\n    <p>He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.</p>\n    <p>The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".</p>\n    <p>The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g3dr4n4no\">already announced</a> by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.</p>\n    <h2>Big tech comes to town</h2>\n    <p>Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.</p>\n    <p>The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.</p>\n    <p>Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.</p>\n    <p>The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1ld568v5j4o\">said to be part of trade discussions</a>.</p>\n    <p>But Ms Kendall told the Today programme \"that wasn't part of the partnership\" now agreed.</p>\n    <p>She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e6z590wweo\">major issue for the UK's creative sector</a> - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.</p>\n    <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmek723dz9o\">promised £5bn</a> for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.</p>\n    <p>Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9jyzl4532o\">accompany Trump to a state banquet</a> hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.</p>\n    <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England</h2>\n    <p>The government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r01y04kz9o\">AI growth zone</a>\".</p>\n    <p>It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland -

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Before Fed chair Jerome Powell can expand on the Fed’s decision in his 2:30 pm ET press conference, right now we just have the Fed’s statement on its rate cut to parse through why officials voted for a cut.</p>\n    <p>Notably, the Fed’s rate-setting board took note of the jobs market.</p>\n    <p>“Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low,” it said. It also noted that “inflation has moved up and remains somewhat elevated.”</p>\n    <p>This is a change from the board’s last meeting in July, when it said that labor market conditions “remain solid”. And this is the first time the board has said inflation is going up.</p>\n    <p>The statement also noted that Stephen Miran, Trump’s appointee to the board who was confirmed on Monday, was the only member of the board to vote against the rate cut. Miran wanted to lower rates by a half-point, instead of a quarter-point.</p>\n    <p>Inflation rose slightly in August as companies continued to push the cost of tariffs on to consumers.</p>\n    <p>The newest update to the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods and services, showed that prices increased 2.9% over the last year – the highest since January. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.</p>\n    <p>Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the US jobs market is weakening.</p>\n    <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.</p>\n    <p>The Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated last month that the central bank was gearing up to cut interest rates for the first time this year.</p>\n    <p>For months, policymakers defied public calls from Trump to lower rates – and brushed off his increasingly aggressive criticism of the Fed’s decision to hold them steady.</p>\n    <p>“With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized speech at the Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming, highlighting a “challenging” dichotomy of risks: that Trump’s tariffs might increase inflation, while his immigration policies knock the US labor market.</p>\n    <p>Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that the labor market has stalled while inflation picked up, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully in the months ahead.</p>\n    <p>Trump has already suggested that he will be unhappy with the modest cut the Fed is widely expected to unveil later. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform early on Monday, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration’s extraordinary bid to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor appointed by Biden, and remove her from the central bank’s board before this meeting, has so far failed.</p>\n    <p>Late on Monday, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s request to block Cook from attending the Fed’s latest rate-setting session, which started yesterday.</p>\n    <p>The president cited unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud as he attempted to fire Cook, who has denied wrongdoing and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038.</p>\n    <p>No president has pursued such action – and moved to dismiss a governor at the Fed, which has long been independent from political interference – since the central bank’s founding in 1913.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his hopes to increase his oversight of the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration raced to strengthen its influence over the Fed ahead of this week’s meeting.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Miran, a senior official who served as chair of the White House council of economic advisers, was confirmed by Senate Republicans as a Fed governor on Monday evening, and formally sworn in on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>His appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch will also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates amid Trump pressure</p>\n    <p>The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce the first interest rate cut since December as a two-day policy meeting nears its end.</p>\n    <p>The Fed started the meeting on Tuesday, hours after Donald Trump’s new appointee narrowly won confirmation to join the central bank – while Fed governor Lisa Cook continues to fight her removal by the president.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Miran, the chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, took the oath of office as a Fed governor early on Tuesday after narrowly winning a Senate confirmation vote along party lines on Monday night.</p>\n    <p>There is little doubt that the Fed will make its first interest rate cut of 2025 after the latest gathering, as policymakers pivot towards shoring up a deteriorating jobs market.</p>\n    <p>But concerns about political influence targeting the independent central bank looms over the gathering, as Trump repeatedly bashes Fed Chair Jerome Powell over his rate decisions, and after he moved to fire governor Lisa Cook, sparking a legal battle.</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the Fed should “listen to smart people like me.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\">confirmed</a> Miran on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting.”</p>\n    <p>The dilemma for the Fed is that lowering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates\">interest rates</a> will make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.</p>\n    <p>Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.</p>\n    <p>The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.</p>\n    <p>Such risks seemed to materialize when federal jobs data for May and June showed the number of jobs added to the economy was revised down by 258,000. Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">Trump’s tariffs</a> have caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025\">estimates</a> that tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?</p>\n    <p>The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\">stagflation</a>”.</p>\n    <p>For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-trade-inflation-tariffs-cbo.html\">told</a> CNBC Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.</p>\n    <p>Wednesday’s rate cut comes at a tense political moment for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> after Trump’s months-long campaign to get the central bank to cut rates.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Whether it’s a favourite bar, biscuit or indulgent hot drink, feeding a chocolate habit costs more than it used to.</p>\n    <p>The price of the chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot.</p>\n    <p>Although other price moves meant overall UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\">was unchanged at 3.8%</a> last month, chocolate was a big riser. Alongside hikes for beef, butter and coffee, it helped propel food price inflation back over 5% for the first time in 18 months.</p>\n    <p>At £30 a go, the luxury 1kg jars of giant chocolate buttons sold by gifting brand Cocoba were a casualty of a soaring cocoa price, explains the company’s founder Darren Litton.</p>\n    <p>With cocoa prices more than doubling over the past two years as a result of poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, even something aimed at gift buyers was being priced off the shelf.</p>\n    <p>“We delisted them for a while because we couldn’t even sell them at £40 with the price of everything involved,” Litton says.</p>\n    <p>Cocoa now commands about $7,800 (£5,700) per tonne on international commodities markets from below $3,500 (£2,600) two years ago. The price peaked at more than $12,000 (£8,800) at the end of 2024.</p>\n    <p>The easing price means Cocoba is bringing the jars of giant buttons back for Christmas, but even at £40 Litton says it’s a challenge to make the numbers add up.</p>\n    <p>“The cocoa price is still at a very, very high level but seems to be settling down a bit,” he adds. “We make everything at our factory in Kent. We’ve had to increase prices and invest in equipment to improve efficiency.”</p>\n    <p>Cocoba is a minnow in a market dominated by big names such as Nestlé and Mars but surging ingredient costs have hurt them too. Mondelēz, which owns Cadbury, expects annual profits to fall 10% owing to higher cocoa prices.</p>\n    <p>The squeeze has triggered numerous rounds of shrinkflation, with the Guardian recently revealing that tubs of Quality Street and Celebrations and even some Toblerone bars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/shrinkflation-bites-as-boxes-of-quality-street-and-celebrations-lose-weight\">have shrunk</a> ahead of Christmas.</p>\n    <p>Not much gets past cash-strapped shoppers, who have also raised eyebrows on discovering a KitKat nine-pack is now an eight-pack, and a multipack of Freddos contains four not five chocolates.</p>\n    <p>Alex Lawrence, a retail expert at data company Circana, says higher ingredient costs are being passed on to the consumer. “If you look at the average price per kg for chocolate confectionery it’s up 27% over the last two years, and 12% in the last year.”</p>\n    <p>Britons spent £5.9bn on chocolate in stores in the year to 9 August. Although that figure was up 10%, they actually physically took home less in their baskets.</p>\n    <p>“The quantity we are buying is down 2% year-on-year,” says Lawrence. “People are definitely pulling back in terms of their consumption.”</p>\n    <p>Shop price data compiled for the Guardian reveals the extent of increases over the past two years, with favourites such as Cadbury Dairy Milk or Galaxy costing about 30% more than in 2023.</p>\n    <p>A 110g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk now costs £1.84 on average, which works out at 42p more than in 2023, according to the price analysts Assosia. The equivalent Galaxy bar has gone up by the same amount to £1.79. The data is based on the average pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.</p>\n    <p>The big companies all say the same thing when asked about pack size reductions and price increases. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Mondelēz told the Guardian it continued to experience “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they had done previously.</p>\n    <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p>\n    <p>On the high street, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk\">upmarket Knoops chain</a> sells posh hot chocolates graded by cocoa percentage, with prices starting at £4 for a drink made with a 28% single-origin Colombian chocolate.</p>\n    <p>“It’s been a wild ride for cocoa prices,” says company founder Jens Knoop. It is not just cocoa, he adds that the chain’s matcha bill increased 53% this month.</p>\n    <p>“While there have been increases in our per kilo chocolate price … we have only passed on a small percentage of that to our customers in their chocolate drinks,” says Knoop.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>But while you might treat yourself to Knoops’ most expensive brew – a limited edition 68% single-origin Madagascan chocolate costing £7.90 – on a day out, in the supermarket consumers balk at tubs of instant hot chocolate costing north of a fiver.</p>\n    <p>The price of a 220g jar of Options is up 20% over two years at £5.40, according to Assosia, prompting shoppers to take to supermarket websites to complain. “This is a good product,” writes one. “It used to be reasonably priced £3-£4 Now it is £5.40!!!!”</p>\n    <p>In a similar vein, at £4.50 a 500g tub of Cadbury hot chocolate costs a fifth more than it did in 2023.</p>\n    <p>Shoppers also complain that other price changes take the biscuit. At £2.25, a 266g pack of McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives costs 35p more than two years ago. Meanwhile a 130g pack of Fox’s milk chocolatey rounds is now £2.30. The same pack cost £1.87 two years ago.</p>\n    <p>The increases are also notable on supermarket own-label chocolate digestives – which provide a cheaper alternative to the big brands – with a 300g pack now £1.12, up from 85p two years ago.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink inflation could hit 5.7% by the end of year, up from August’s reading of 5.1%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food\">Food</a> and Drink Federation.</p>\n    <p>Karen Betts, the trade body’s chief executive, says rising food prices were previously down to energy and commodity shocks, but now government policies – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/reeves-defends-40bn-tax-increase-in-autumn-budget-as-businesses-prepare-for-nics-hike\">April’s increase in employers’ national insurance contributions</a> – were a driver.</p>\n    <p>“The costs are such that companies can no longer absorb them and are having to pass at least some of them on to consumers.”</p>\n    <p>Needless to say it’s a difficult environment for small companies such as Temprd, which makes “properly chunky” chocolate bars, in flavours such as lemon and blueberry cheesecake.</p>\n    <p>When Rob Anthony started the Essex company with his brother five years ago he was aware that its premium bars looked expensive compared to “run of the mill” chocolate. “At that time our bars were probably around £3 per 100g. Now they are £4.50.</p>\n    <p>“We had to make two jumps, from £3 to £3.75 and then to £4.50, so two price rises in the last four years,” he says, but is hopeful the worst is over.</p>\n    <p>“There might be a [cocoa] surplus this year, because demand has fallen, and production has been quite good. We’re fairly confident we can survive through from now to next Easter without having to put our prices up.”</p>\n    <p>As the brands sold in supermarkets become more expensive Anthony suggests people are becoming more circumspect.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t changed the recipe,” he says. “We haven’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">skimpflated</a> our product or changed the size. We just put the price up to cope with price increases. People are willing to spend more less often to buy a luxury product … they feel they’re getting better value for money.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/chocolate-inflation-consumers-spend-more-but-get-less-prices-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The cost of air fares was the main downward driver, while prices rose for petrol and diesel. The cost of hotel accommodation also fell by less than this time last year.</p>\n    <p>Food price inflation climbed for a fifth consecutive month, up from 4.9% in July to 5.1% in August, with small increases in a range of vegetables, cheese and fish items. The price of chocolate rose by 15.4%, while the cost of beef, butter and coffee also increased sharply.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">facing intense scrutiny over Labour’s economic management</a> amid widespread speculation about tax increases in her autumn budget, which is expected on 26 November.</p>\n    <p>Business groups said the chancellor’s 2024 autumn budget measures, including the £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a>, would force them to cut jobs and raise prices.</p>\n    <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “With borrowing costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">hitting a 27-year high</a>, working people and businesses are bracing for even more tax rises to pay for Labour’s mismanagement.”</p>\n    <p>Reeves said the government was taking action to help households. “I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.”</p>\n    <p>The Bank forecasts inflation is on track to peak at 4%, with the potential to delay further interest rate cuts. Threadneedle Street has cut borrowing costs five times since summer 2024.</p>\n    <p>City economists said there were some signs that inflationary pressures were beginning to abate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> for consumer services, which is closely watched by the Bank, slowed to 4.7% from 5% in July. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food and tobacco prices, fell to 3.6% from 3.8%.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Inflation has come down from a peak of 11.1% in the second half of 2022, the highest rate in four decades, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuelled an increase in the price of energy and food.</p>\n    <p>Although the headline rate has fallen back, households have come under renewed pressure after a rise in taxes and regulated utility prices in April, including for energy and water. Threadneedle Street has also expressed concern over fast-rising food prices, which hit lower-income households hardest.</p>\n    <p>Economists say that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/28/climateflation-could-push-up-uk-food-prices-by-more-than-a-third-by-2050-report-says\">extreme weather conditions are pushing up food prices</a>, as the climate emergency causes more droughts and floods, affecting harvests around the world. UK food manufacturers and retailers said government regulations and taxes were also having an effect.</p>\n    <p>Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, urged the Bank to cut rates to ease pressure on workers, arguing that high borrowing costs would have little impact on price increases due to global challenges.</p>\n    <p>“Keeping interest rates high will not bring down these prices – but instead, rates are adding to the pain for families and businesses,” the TUC boss said.</p>\n    <p>Official figures on Tuesday showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">the jobs market cooled in July</a>, while economic growth remains weak, adding to pressure on the Bank to consider a cut in rates. The ONS will provide updated figures for retail sales and the government finances on Friday. However, analysts said concerns remained over stubborn inflation.</p>\n    <p>Martin Sartorius, the principal economist at the CBI business lobby group, said: “The monetary policy committee [MPC] looks set to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow and, going forward, the MPC faces a delicate balance between signs of a cooling labour market and the risk of price pressures remaining stubbornly high.”</p>\n    <p>UK inflation is running at the highest rate in the G7, outpacing a 2.9% headline rate in the US. The rate is also significantly above the eurozone’s 2.1%, and flash estimates for France (0.8%) and Germany (2.1%), for August.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p>\n    <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p>\n    <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p>\n    <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p>\n    <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p>\n    <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/labour-growth-far-right-economy-andy-haldane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-25\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p>\n    <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p>\n    <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p>\n    <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p>\n    <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p>\n    <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p>\n    <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p>\n    <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p>\n    <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p>\n    <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p>\n    <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p>\n    <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’. This could well lead to an early-Autumn pullback in equity markets ahead of the next Fed meeting.”</p>\n<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire has suffered a blow from ratings agency Fitch overnight.</p>\n<p>Fitch has downgraded INEOS Group to ‘BB-’, with a negative outlook, down from BB. That’s a one-notch fall, to the 13th place on Fitch’s scale of credit worthiness, and still leaves Ineos ranked as ‘non-investment grade’.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision, Fitch points out that Ineos is increasingly highly leveraged, due to the “weak chemical market” and high spending on a new ethane cracker in the Port of Antwerp.</p>\n<p>Fitch also predicts that Ineos’s revenue to grow by 2% on average in 2025-2029, after growing 9% in 2024.</p>\n<p>A lower credit rating implies a higher risk of default, or debt restructuring, and can result in higher borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>A dried sunflower field in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian</p>\n<p>Last summer’s extremely hot weather was not great for the European and Ukrainian sunflower crop.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian and European sunflower oil prices have jumped, Bloomberg reports, as forecasters expect low yields in the country and limited production across the continent.</p>\n<p>That’s because the hot, dry summer hampered crop development.</p>\n<p>There are forecasts that Europe could see its worst sunflower harvest in a decade, while harvesting in Ukraine is slow following a drought this year.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, sunflower yields are expected to fall below the five-year average “largely due to the drought in the south, where most sunflower cultivation takes place,” the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a report.</p>\n<p>Europe is facing similar challenges, with top producer France expecting output to drop 15% below the five-year average, according to figures from the French agriculture ministry.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, retail sales were stronger than expected last month – which might deter the Federal Reserve from a surprisingly hefty interest rate cut tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Spending at retail and food services sites jumped by 0.6% month-on-month in August, and were 5% higher than in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Economists had expected a smaller rise, of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>It’s an encouraging sign for US economic growth, but could also encourage Fed policymakers to vote for a quarter-point cut to interest rates, rather than a larger, half-point cut.</p>\n<p>U.S. retail sales stronger than expected.
