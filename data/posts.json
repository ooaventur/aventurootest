The move also comes as AI agents are being used more and more, with the market expected to grow about 45% each year over the next five years, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/capabilities/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents\">report</a> by consulting firm BCG. </p>\n    <p>The A2A protocol will serve as the foundation for “a new class of multi-agent applications and workflows, from automated financial services to prediction markets,” according to a press release viewed by The Defiant.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this week, Google unveiled its Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), which helps AI agents send and receive payments across different blockchains. It uses the x402 standard to make payments work smoothly, no matter which blockchain the money is on.</p>\n    <p>“We're excited to be a launch partner for [Google Cloud's] new Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), a standard that gives AI agents the ability to transact with trust and accountability,” EigenCloud wrote on its official X page. “At EigenCloud, our focus is on verifiability.”</p>\n    <p>EigenCloud said the deal adds a “trust layer” that lets AI agents prove their work, verify payments, and follow human-set rules. EigenCloud’s system also handles tasks like moving money between blockchains and confirming that work is completed correctly, according to the release.</p>\n    <p>EigenCloud (previously EigenLayer) is the largest Ethereum restaking protocol and currently boasts a total-value locked (TVL) of over $20 billion, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n    <h2>Google’s Moves</h2>\n    <p>EigenCloud isn’t the only project that Google is partnering with for this initiative. The tech giant is collaborating with more than 60 companies – including Coinbase, the <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/ethereum-foundation-transfers-over-usd100-million-worth-of-eth-into-defi-lending-protocols\">Ethereum Foundation</a>, MetaMask, and Adobe – to help deploy AP2 and further its adoption.</p>\n    <p>“Blockchains are the natural payment layer for agents, and Ethereum will be the backbone of this,” said Marco De Rossi, AI Lead at MetaMask, per a Google Cloud <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol\">blog post</a>. “With Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) and x402, MetaMask will deliver maximum interoperability for developers and will enable users to pay agents with full composability and choice—while retaining the security and control of true self-custody.” </p>\n    <p>The Defiant has reached out to MetaMask and the Ethereum Foundation for comment on their roles in AP2’s expansion, but has not yet received a response.</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Ethereum (<a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/prices/ethereum\">ETH</a>) is trading near $4,630, gaining roughly 3% on the day.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/prices/ripple\">XRP</a> is up 3% at $3.12, while Solana (<a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/prices/solana\">SOL</a>) has climbed 6% to $249.BNB is trading near $995 after briefly topping $1,003 to set a new all-time high. The token’s momentum is being fueled by rising network activity and <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/blockchains/bnb-approaches-usd1-000-as-binance-looks-to-escape-doj-monitor\">reports that Binance may be nearing a deal</a> to sidestep the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) compliance monitor.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.thedefiant.io%2Fpasted-1758216734796-png-20b2d0a1-a269-4888-93c6-a9844a50c8bf.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=100\" alt=\"BNB Chart\"/>\n    <p>Overall, the total crypto market capitalization rose 2.3% over the past day, reaching $4.21 trillion, with Bitcoin dominance at 56.1% and Ethereum at 13.2%, according to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/\">CoinGecko</a>.</p>\n    <p>Experts said the Fed’s rate cut has reignited interest across crypto markets, particularly in stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi), as lower interest rates often push investors toward higher-risk, higher-yield assets.</p>\n    <p>Sidney Powell, CEO and co-founder of Maple Finance, explained that liquidity tends to flow into crypto in stages.</p>\n    <p>“Bitcoin and ETH take the first leg up, then you see a rotation into altcoins like SOL and XRP, and subsequently into DeFi and other smaller cap tokens,” Powell told The Defiant. “For DeFi, lower rates are a clear positive because they boost leverage appetite, trading volumes, and protocol fees.”</p>\n    <p>Powell added that if the current cutting cycle continues, it could “reignite venture flows and institutional allocation, which gives the whole ecosystem a stronger foundation for the next growth phase.”</p>\n    <h2>Liquidations and ETFs</h2>\n    <p>Over the past 24 hours, nearly $409 million in crypto positions were liquidated, according to <a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData\">Coinglass</a>, including more than $167 million in long positions and $241 million in shorts. </p>\n    <p>Ethereum led the way with over $121 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at nearly $107 million, while other altcoins accounted for more than $28 million.</p>\n    <p>On Sept. 17, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $51 million in outflows, ending a seven-day streak of inflows that had totaled nearly $2.9 billion, according to SoSoValue. Spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded outflows of nearly $2 million, marking the second consecutive day of withdrawals.</p>\n    <h2>Fed Policy Impact</h2>\n    <p>Thursday’s market activity follows the Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday, along with strong signals that two additional cuts could come later this year.</p>\n    <p>Powell noted that these rate cuts could heavily influence crypto yields and investor behavior.</p>\n    <p>“Typically, crypto yields have moved counter to traditional rates. The reason is that as the Fed cuts, it drives investors into more growth and risk on assets like crypto,” the Maple Finance CEO explained. “This drives up the price and results in higher funding costs, so the crypto yield spread widens and becomes more attractive.”</p>\n    <p>He added that the move is likely to spark greater interest in stablecoin yields for better returns.</p>\n    <p>“This will trigger a growth in the balance sheets of crypto lenders like AAVE, Maple and Tether,” Powell said. “We have already started to see traditional allocators doing due diligence on crypto-backed loans, so the rate cut may accelerate adoption here.”</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

The protocol’s goal, as the team explained in its post, is to create “savings that preserve value, deep USDT markets, and the lowest USDT borrow rates in the industry.” Per its website, Plasma is described as an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible L1, with a native Bitcoin bridge.</p>\n    <p>As part of the rollout, users will be able to bridge vault deposits to Plasma and withdraw USD₮0, Tether’s omnichain version of USDT. The launch will also introduce zero-fee USDT transfers through Plasma’s dashboard, initially limited to Plasma’s own products, with broader access planned over time.</p>\n    <p>At launch, 25 million <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/markets/plasmas-xpl-token-hits-5-billion-valuation-pre-market-debut-7ce93ed6\">XPL tokens</a> will be distributed to smaller depositors and verified participants, with an additional 2.5 million tokens set aside for members of the Stablecoin Collective, a community created to promote stablecoin adoption.</p>\n    <p>U.S. participants from the public sale won’t receive tokens until July 2026 due to regulatory rules, the announcement notes.</p>\n    <h2>Demand for Stablecoin Exposure</h2>\n    <p>Plasma’s initial coin offering deposit vault — which gave participants access to allocations of its upcoming XPL token — was launched in June and saw massive investor interest, showcasing strong demand for exposure to the stablecoin sector. Initially capped at $250 million, the deposit vault <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/tokens/plasma-stablecoin-blockchain-1-billion-deposit-vault\">ended up being raised to $1 billion,</a> which was filled within 30 minutes. </p>\n    <p>In late July, Plasma <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/tokens/bitfinex-backed-plasma-ends-public-sale-with-usd300m-oversubscription\">closed the public sale</a> of its tokens with more than $373 million in commitments to buy $50 million worth of XPL. Just this week, a pre-deposit vault for Maple’s <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/maple-s-usd200-million-plasma-vault-gets-filled-instantly\">syrupUSDT on Plasma</a>, which also gave participants an XPL allocation, was filled in less than a minute. </p>\n    <p>In an X post after the public sale closed, Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of Split Capital, called the funding “the largest publicly confirmed oversubscription in liquid crypto in recent history.”</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

Retail users often only gain exposure once tokens begin trading openly, long after early backers and insiders have secured allocations. </p><p>Kraken Launch is intended to change that dynamic by offering a model it describes as “IPO-style” token sales, ensuring greater transparency, equal access, and regulatory clarity.</p><p>The product arrives as Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework begins to take effect, with Kraken emphasizing that all sales conducted through the platform will adhere to clear regulatory requirements. </p><p>According to the company, participants will have access to all necessary information, free from hidden allocations or insider deals, while enjoying the security and compliance infrastructure of the Kraken exchange.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>“Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” said Brett McLain, the exchange’s Head of Payments and Blockchain. </p><p>He added that the partnership with Legion would help democratize token sales by aligning communities with project builders, setting what he called a “higher standard” for the next generation of fundraising.</p><p>Legion, which has built a reputation for its compliance-focused fundraising technology, will serve as the backbone of the initiative. </p><p>Its system evaluates participants based on on-chain history, social activity, and developer contributions, ensuring that a portion of token allocations go to those who have meaningfully contributed to the ecosystem. </p><p>The rest of the sales will be open on a first-come, first-served basis, both on Kraken Launch and Legion. Matt O’Connor, co-founder of Legion, framed the partnership as a step toward transforming capital markets.</p><p>“The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community on-chain,” he said.</p><p>The announcement comes as Kraken continues to report strong financial performance despite market volatility.</p><p>In its Q1 2025 update, the exchange <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/press-releases/kraken-q1-financial-report-ninjatrader-acquisition/\">disclosed $472 million in revenue and $187 million in adjusted EBITDA</a>, a 19% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 1% rise in EBITDA. </p><p>Trading volumes grew 29% compared with the previous year, while funded accounts increased by 26%.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-revenue-rises-to-411-6-million-in-q2-up-18-from-last-year/\">Kraken’s second-quarter figures showed</a> a similar trend. Revenue climbed 18% year-on-year to $411.6 million, though adjusted EBITDA fell 7% to $79.7 million as weaker volumes followed a strong first quarter. </p><p>Total exchange volume reached $186.8 billion, up 19% year-on-year but down 11% from Q1. Assets on the platform rose sharply, increasing 47% over the year to $43.2 billion by June. </p><p>The launch of Kraken’s new product also comes amid reports that the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-to-raise-500m-in-funding-at-a-15b-valuation/\">company is preparing to raise $500 million at a $15 billion valuation</a> ahead of a long-anticipated initial public offering scheduled for early 2026. </p><p>Co-CEO Arjun Sethi has said the raise could help solidify investor confidence before the listing.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-kraken-launches-tokenized-stock-trading-for-european-investors\">Kraken Launches Tokenized Stock Trading for European Investors</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Crypto exchange Kraken has introduced xStocks, a tokenized securities trading product aimed at giving European investors access to leading U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </p><p>The service, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-introduces-tokenized-securities-trading-in-europe/\">launched on September 10 through Kraken’s PEDSL-CY entity</a>, is restricted to EU clients who pass an appropriateness test or qualify as professional investors. U.S. residents are excluded, as xStocks are not registered under the Securities Act.</p><p>Launched in May, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-debuts-50-tokenized-u-s-stocks-for-24-7-trading-americans-excluded/\">xStocks operate as tokenized certificates </a>that mirror the market price of real-world securities, issued on-chain as SPL or BNB tokens. Each is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset and issued by Jersey-based Backed Assets (JE) Limited.</p><p>Holders gain exposure to price movements but do not receive shareholder rights such as voting or dividends. At launch, Kraken listed 60 assets, including Tesla, Apple, and GameStop.</p><p>The move follows increasing regulatory scrutiny of tokenized equities. In August, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-meets-sec-crypto-task-force-to-discuss-asset-tokenization/\">representatives from Kraken met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> to discuss tokenized trading frameworks, disclosure standards, and investor protections. </p><p>Regulators worldwide have warned that tokenized stocks often lack the safeguards present in traditional equity markets, despite their 24/7 availability.</p><p>Kraken has also been expanding its tokenization partnerships. In July, i<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-and-backed-expand-xstocks-access-through-bnb-chain/\">t teamed up with Backed Finance and BNB Chain </a>to extend xStocks as BEP-20 tokens, enabling broader access within decentralized finance.</p><p>The rollout shows Kraken’s strategy to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. By bringing equities on-chain, the exchange is positioning tokenized securities as a new frontier in digital asset trading.</p>\n                                                            \n                                \n                                                        <div id=\"tabs-desc-show\" class=\"desc-show-only\">\n                                <p class=\"news-tab\">\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links active\" data-class=\"trending-top\">Trending News</button>\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-0\">Recommended</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-1\">Popular Crypto Topics</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-2\">Price Predictions</button></p>\n<p class=\"news-tab-line\"></p>\n\n        \n        \n        \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-rolls-out-ipo-style-token-sales-in-mica-compliant-launch-on-legion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. </p><p>By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>Until recently, most of that trading happened on Raydium, Solana’s primary DEX, which meant Snorter’s reach was limited to a fraction of the opportunities. The latest update – first shared by the team on August 22 – expands support to Pump.fun and PumpSwap, Solana’s busiest launchpads for new meme coins.</p><p>With this integration, <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snor</a><a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/snorter/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">t</a><a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">er</a> can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. In practice, this widens coverage so retail users can catch plays at the very start of a coin’s lifecycle, when the upside is often greatest.</p><p>The updates also make trading more hands-off for users. Automated trading now runs on smarter infrastructure that watches the market continuously and pulls the trigger when targets are met, with real-time notifications sent the moment trades go through. </p><p>Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6\" target=\"_blank\">https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-snorter-is-fine-tuning-withdrawals-and-copy-trading-to-protect-retail-profits\">Snorter is Fine-Tuning Withdrawals and Copy-Trading to Protect Retail Profits</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>On September 11, the project released new updates that show the team fine-tuning some of <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snorter’s</a> core features. </p><p>Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. </p><p>Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. </p><p>At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load.</p><p>These refinements matter because they push <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snorter</a> beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-why-traders-see-30x-potential-in-snort\">Why Traders See 30x Potential in SNORT</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. </p><p>They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram.</p><p>Investor interest in the presale reflects that potential as $4 million could be hit in a matter of hours. Traders see Snorter as a rare chance to back a bot that could soon rival – or even surpass – incumbents like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan.</p><p>And at the center of it all is the SNORT token, which powers the ecosystem by unlocking the lowest fees in the market at just 0.85%, while also serving as the currency for staking rewards, governance, and advanced features that make the bot more effective.</p><p>It’s no surprise then that top crypto news outlets like Cryptonews have already predicted SNORT could deliver a 30x return once it launches.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</p></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-here-s-how-to-buy-snort\">Here’s How to Buy SNORT</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>To join the presale, head to the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/snorter/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Snorter Bot Token site</a> to secure your SNORT tokens using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.</p><p>For the smoothest transaction, use a WalletConnect-certified non-custodial wallet such as Best Wallet, which is regarded as one of the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">best crypto and Bitcoin wallets</a> in the space. </p><p>Balances from the presale display directly in-app, with claiming made easy.

Staking is about taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain,”</em> Buterin <a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1968428048086352285\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>, emphasizing that <em>“friction in quitting is part of the deal.”</em></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ethereum Validator Queue (Source: <a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ValidatorQueue</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-developer-tensions-over-user-experience\">Developer Tensions Over User Experience</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>The exchange highlighted growing tensions between Ethereum’s technical design priorities and mainstream user expectations for digital asset liquidity.</p><p>Sags criticized the disconnect between wallet messaging that promotes <em>“easy yield”</em> and the reality of unpredictable withdrawal delays that can trap funds when users need them most.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p><em>“What about the average user who is suffering with the delay and needs to pay bills?”</em> Sags questioned, arguing that clearer disclosure about redemption periods would help users make informed decisions.</p><p>Buterin acknowledged these UX concerns, admitting the Ethereum Foundation <em>“needs to be more active at the UX layer”</em> and has been working to address usability issues over recent months.</p><p>The Ethereum founder argued that reducing exit delays would make the chain <em>“much less trustworthy from the PoV of any node that does not go online very frequently,”</em> positioning the delays as essential for maintaining network stability.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-queue-dynamics-create-market-tension\">Queue Dynamics Create Market Tension</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>The current validator queue mechanics operate through strict churn limits of 256 validators per epoch, creating bottlenecks when exit demand surges beyond the network’s processing capacity.</p><p>Recent market data shows the exit queue peaked at over 1 million ETH worth approximately $5 billion in late August, before settling to current levels, still requiring 43 days to clear completely.</p><p>Meanwhile, the entry queue containing 432,077 ETH faces just a 7-day wait, creating an asymmetric dynamic that traps more supply than it releases in the short term.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ethereum Queue Wait Time (Source: <a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ValidatorQueue</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>This imbalance has created what analysts describe as artificial supply shortages, with<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/833k-eth-trapped-in-validator-queue-creates-supply-shortage-4500-breakout-next/\"> previous Cryptonews reports</a> highlighting how 833,000 ETH trapped in queues reduced available trading supply.</p><p>The 9.1-day sweep delay adds additional friction to the exit process, meaning validators face multiple layers of waiting even after initiating unstaking requests.</p><p>Exchange flow data reveals these queue dynamics are reducing sell pressure, with Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows hitting<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-inflows-hit-1-year-low-as-crypto-investors-brace-for-fed-decision-btc-eyes-120k/\"> 1-year lows</a> as larger holders avoid moving assets to trading platforms.</p><p>Staking demand has continued growing despite the exit delays, with the queue reaching<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-staking-queue-hits-3-7b-highest-level-since-2023/\"> $3.7 billion in early September</a>, its highest level since the Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in 2023.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-security-versus-liquidity-trade-offs-spark-broader-debate\">Security Versus Liquidity Trade-offs Spark Broader Debate</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Notably, the unstaking controversy is a fundamental tension between blockchain security models and modern financial expectations for asset liquidity.</p><p>Buterin’s military analogy reflects Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design philosophy, where validator commitments must be sticky enough to prevent coordinated attacks or mass exodus events that could destabilize consensus.</p><p>Critics argue this creates a dangerous precedent where large holders face material liquidity constraints, potentially amplifying sell pressure when exits do occur or forcing investors toward liquid staking derivatives.</p><p>The debate has sparked discussions about potential protocol modifications, including proposals for faster validator key switching that would allow repositioning without full exits.</p><p>One X user suggested implementing <em>“a faster process to unstake and restake with different clients that’s not adding to the queue”</em> to improve client diversity without compromising security guarantees.</p><p>Buterin responded favorably to a <em>“switch your keys”</em> function where validators would remain vulnerable to slashing from old keys temporarily while continuing to stake, describing it as something that <em>“would only help, and would not hurt any guarantees.”</em></p><p>However, any changes to the current queue system would require broad consensus among Ethereum developers and stakeholders, given the security implications of reducing validator commitment friction.</p>\n

Most analyst price prediction for PI coin have leaned bearish, and the chart hasn’t given much reason to think otherwise. Still, the Pi Core Team is pushing ahead with network upgrades.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://x.com/cryptoleakvn/status/1968487275916050640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">latest Pi Node Docker</a> now includes Stellar Core v23 and Horizon v23, confirming Pi Network has started rolling out its V23 upgrade. This boosts both performance and compliance. Pi’s official account also noted that “Testnet1 blockchain has been upgraded from protocol version 19 to version 22,” calling it the first step toward unlocking new layers of functionality and control.</p><p>This news sparked only a small bounce, with PI coin up about 3% in the past 24 hours and 4% on the week. Encouraging, maybe, but the chart tells a different story. A clear bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern is forming, and with the network expected to temporarily go offline during the upgrade, price pressure could easily increase, something history has shown again and again in crypto.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-pi-coin-price-prediction-bearish-chart-signals-trouble-ahead\">PI Coin Price Prediction: Bearish Chart Signals Trouble Ahead</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: PIUSD / <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PIUSDT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TradingView</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>The PI coin chart is throwing a clean head and shoulders, the classic bearish vibe. The right shoulder looks done after that bounce, and the neckline is sitting right at $0.33. If price slips under it, its probably heading for $0.31, which would mark a new all-time low.</p><p>For bulls to fight back, PI needs to reclaim $0.37 with solid volume. Until that happens, every bounce is more like a trap than a rally, setting things up for another leg down.</p><p>Backing this up, the RSI is sitting mid-range around 44, not oversold yet, so there is room for more downside.

around $994. </p><p>The 50% extension projects toward $1,200, representing approximately 20% upside from current levels with a strong technical foundation.</p><p>The golden zone between $764-832 represents deeper retracement levels should a significant correction materialize. </p><p>However, the $918 level serves as immediate support for trend continuation, aligning with the analyst’s noted crucial support threshold.</p><p>Sub-wave markers indicate potential for further subdivision if current consolidation evolves into more complex corrective patterns. </p><p>The overall structure

peak transaction counts reaching 16-17 million during high-activity periods. </p><p>To take it even further, the weekly timeframe analysis emphasizes the significance of the $1,000 breakout in the historical context.</p><p>The decisive move above multi-year resistance levels suggests a fundamental shift in market perception rather than a temporary speculation-driven advance.</p><p>Successful

Fidelity’s FBTC was the hardest hit, posting $116.03 million in daily outflows, despite holding a historical net inflow of $12.56 billion. </p>\n<p>Grayscale’s flagship GBTC also logged heavy losses, with $62.64 million withdrawn, while Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB shed $32.29 million. Smaller declines were seen at Bitwise’s BITB, which lost $12.58 million.</p>\n<p>Not all funds recorded redemptions, however. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continued to attract capital, pulling in $149.73 million on the day. </p>\n<p>Grayscale’s lower-fee Bitcoin Mini Trust ($BTC) also posted $22.54 million in inflows, raising its lifetime tally to $1.84 billion.</p>\n<p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p>\n<p>The net outflows left the total assets under management for Bitcoin spot ETFs at $152.45 billion, equivalent to 6.62% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. </p>\n<p>Cumulative net inflows across all products since launch stand at $57.33 billion. Prices tracked lower alongside the shift in flows, with many ETFs ending the day down just over 1%.</p>\n<p>Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, remain under pressure. On September 17, Ether products saw $1.89 million in net outflows, extending a streak of withdrawals that has persisted since early September. </p>\n<p>Fidelity’s FETH was the largest loser, with $29.19 million in redemptions. Bitwise’s ETHW also saw $9.67 million exit the fund. </p>\n<p>Inflows at BlackRock’s ETHA, which added $25.86 million, and smaller gains at Grayscale’s products were not enough to offset the broader weakness.</p>\n<p>Total assets under management for Ether ETFs now stand at $29.72 billion, or 5.47% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Cumulative inflows are reported at $13.66 billion. </p>\n<p>The figures follow a period of heavy selling earlier this month, when Ether ETFs lost more than $1 billion over six consecutive sessions, including a <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/alarming-1b-drain-hits-spot-eth-etfs-in-6-day-streak-is-a-deeper-crash-imminent/\">$446.7 million single-day withdrawal on September 9</a>.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have shown stronger resilience. Earlier in September, funds added more than $1.7 billion in inflows over four days, reversing weakness from late August when Bitcoin ETFs posted their first weekly outflows since June. </p>\n<p>Ether funds continue to bleed assets after a brief rebound mid-month, raising questions about institutional conviction in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-sec-approves-new-listing-standards-paving-way-for-more-crypto-spot-etfs\">SEC Approves New Listing Standards, Paving Way for More Crypto Spot ETFs</span></h2>\n<p>The ETF market has seen renewed institutional interest.

He wrote:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“From the victim’s perspective, he just clicked a few times to confirm the wallet’s pop-up signature requests, didn’t spend a single penny of gas, and $6.28 million was gone.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>How Permit exploits work</h2>\n    <p>Permit approvals were originally designed to simplify token transfers. Instead of submitting an on-chain approval and paying fees, a user can sign an off-chain message authorizing a spender.</p>\n    <p>That efficiency, however, has created a new attack surface for malicious players.</p>\n    <p>Once a user signs such a permit, attackers can combine two functions—Permit and TransferFrom—to drain assets directly. Because the authorization takes place off-chain, wallet dashboards show no unusual activity until the funds move.</p>\n    <p>As a result, the assets are gone when the approval executes on-chain, and tokens are redirected to the attacker’s wallet.</p>\n    <p>This loophole has made permit exploits increasingly attractive for malicious actors, who can siphon millions without needing complex hacks or high-cost gas wars.</p>\n    <h2>Phishing losses</h2>\n    <p>The latest theft highlights a wider trend of escalating phishing campaigns.</p>\n    <p>Scam Sniffer <a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1964235400593178793\">reported</a> that in August alone, attackers stole $12.17 million from more than 15,200 victims. That figure represented a 72% jump in losses compared with July.</p>\n    <p>According to the firm, the most significant share of August’s damages came from three large accounts that accounted for nearly half of the total. This included one wallet that lost $3.08 million in a single exploit.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the firm attributed the surge in losses to a rise in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-investor-loses-1m-in-uniswap-scam-exploiting-ethereums-eip-7702/\">EIP-7702 batch-signature scams</a> and direct transfers to malicious contracts.</p>\n    <p>Considering this, security experts have urged crypto users to be cautious when interacting with wallet requests and refuse demands that grant unlimited permissions to their wallets.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-whale-loses-6m-to-sneaky-phishing-scheme-targeting-staked-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.”</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.”</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains.</p>\n    <p>The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high.</p>\n    <p>This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>\n        <i>About TRON DAO</i>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>About TRON DAO</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>\n    <p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://tron.network/\">TRONNetwork</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.org/\"> TRONDAO</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/TRONDAO\">X</a> |<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\"> YouTube</a> |<a href=\"https://t.me/tronnetworkEN\"> Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/trondao\">Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/\"> Reddit</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/tronprotocol\"> GitHub</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.medium.com/\"> Medium</a> |<a href=\"https://forum.trondao.org/\"> Forum</a></p>\n    <p><strong> Media Contact</strong>Yeweon Park</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/paypal-usd-expands-to-tron-network-via-layerzero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In that light, frictions such as exit delays serve as safeguards.</p>\n    <p>“An army cannot hold together if any percent of it can suddenly leave at any time,” he wrote, stressing that Ethereum’s reliability depends on ensuring validators cannot abandon their role instantaneously.</p>\n    <p>However, Buterin conceded that the current design is not perfect. Nevertheless, he argued:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“That’s not to say that the current staking queue design is optimal, rather that if you reduce the constants naively then that makes the chain much less trustworthy from the PoV of any node that does not go online very frequently.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Buterin’s remarks echoed the perspective of Sreeram Kannan, founder of restaking protocol <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/eigenlayer/\">EigenLayer</a>.</p>\n    <p>In his own <a href=\"https://x.com/sreeramkannan/status/1968350778697142521?s=46\">post</a> on Sept. 17, Kannan described Ethereum’s prolonged exit period as “a conservative parameter” that acts as a vital security measure.</p>\n    <p>He explained that the wait time protects against worst-case scenarios, such as coordinated validator attacks where participants might attempt to exit before facing slashing penalties.</p>\n    <p>Considering this, Kannan warned:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Unstaking cannot be instantaneous.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>He continued that shortening the process to a matter of days could expose Ethereum to attacks that drain its security assumptions.</p>\n    <p>By contrast, the longer window allows for detecting and punishing malicious behavior such as double-signing. This design ensures that misbehaving validators cannot easily escape accountability.</p>\n    <p>Kannan highlighted that this buffer allows inactive nodes to reconnect and periodically validate the correct fork. He argued that competing forks could each claim to be valid without such a mechanism, leaving offline nodes unable to determine the truth when rejoining.</p>\n    <p>He concluded:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Instead of having a fixed long unstaking period, ethereum engineered its exit queue to be instantaneous if only a small amount of stake withdrew in a given period. But if lot of stake wants to withdraw the queue builds up – worst case to several months.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This strong defense comes at a time when <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-staking-exit-wait-balloons-to-43-days/\">Ethereum’s exit queue</a> has hit historic highs.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\">Data</a> from the Ethereum Validators Queue shows that the unstaking backlog now spans 43 days, with over 2.48 million ETH, valued at approximately $11.3 billion, awaiting withdrawal.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/vitalik-buterin-defends-43-day-ethereum-exit-staking-queue-as-11-3b-waits-in-line-what-breaks-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n    <p>The United Kingdom’s minority party Reform has formally rejected the Bank of England’s proposal to cap stablecoin holdings and its broader plan to introduce a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bank-of-england-advances-design-phase-of-digital-pound-cbdc/\">central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a>.</p>\n    <p>In a Sept. 18 <a href=\"https://x.com/ziayusufuk/status/1968575233784160260?s=46\">statement</a> on X, the party’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, alongside party figurehead Nigel Farage, warned that the measures would damage Britain’s competitiveness in the global digital economy.</p>\n    <p>Last week, the Bank of England proposed restricting stablecoin exposure for individuals and businesses. Under the draft proposal, citizens would be limited to holding between £10,000 and £20,000 in systemic stablecoins, while businesses would face a maximum cap of £10 million.</p>\n    <p>The regulator argues that the plan aims to reduce financial risks as digital assets become more mainstream.</p>\n    <p>However, the Reform party leaders framed the proposal as an attack on innovation rather than a safeguard.</p>\n    <p>They argued that limiting the use of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/insights/stablecoins-could-face-yield-compression-after-feds-rate-cut/\">stablecoins</a> risks choking off demand for British government debt while strengthening the position of global rivals.</p>\n    <p>According to the statement, dollar–pegged stablecoins like <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin/\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/\">USDT</a> funnel significant liquidity into US Treasuries, reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in digital finance. By contrast, the UK lacks any mechanism equivalent to a backstop demand for gilts.</p>\n    <p>Yusuf wrote:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Now ask yourself: where is the British equivalent? Where is the pound-backed stablecoin with deep liquidity, one that global markets can trust, one that channels fresh demand into UK gilts? It doesn’t exist, because policymakers here have been openly hostile to innovators. Instead of building the future, Britain’s regulators have smothered it.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Considering this, Yusuf argued that “stablecoins are not a danger to financial stability.” Instead, he described the assets as:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“[A] bridge between the digital world and the traditional banking system. A bridge between entrepreneurs and customers, between investors and opportunity. They are simply new wrappers around money – safer, faster, programmable money that can settle instantly across borders without costly intermediaries.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>No to CBDC</h2>\n    <p>The Reform Party has also fought hard against the creation of a digital pound.</p>\n    <p>According to the party, a state-backed CBDC would hand the Bank of England “unprecedented control” over financial activity, stifling competition and discouraging private-sector innovation.</p>\n    <p>Instead, they advocate for regulated, privately issued stablecoins that could drive growth without giving government entities direct control over citizens’ wallets.</p>\n    <p>To support that approach, the party said it would advance its proposed Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to establish a transparent and proportionate regulatory framework.</p>\n    <p>By creating rules that balance consumer protection with market freedom, Reform argues the UK could emerge as a leader in the global stablecoin race and generate new employment opportunities in fintech and digital finance.</p>\n    <p>The stance marks another step in the party’s embrace of crypto. Earlier this year, it became one of the first political groups in the UK to accept donations in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> and other digital assets.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>[Editor’s Note: Context on UK politics. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Reform holds five parliamentary seats within the current government behind Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Sinn Féin. It has minimal sway in current UK legislation.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>However, a collapse in support for Labour has placed Reform at the top of  YouGov polling for the over-50s around a hypothetical snap election. The next election is scheduled for 2029.]</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/uk-reform-party-argues-stablecoin-limits-stifle-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n<p>There’s little doubt that Tether has conquered the world with <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether\">USDT</a>. With a market cap of $171 billion, it outpaces <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/stablecoin/\">all other stablecoins combined.</a></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Tether <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-launches-compliant-usat-stablecoin-under-new-leadership/\">introduced</a> a new U.S. dollar stablecoin, USA₮, to compete with <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin\">USDC</a> in the domestic market under U.S. law.</p>\n<p>The company named Bo Hines to lead its U.S. unit and build issuance and custody around Anchorage Digital and Cantor Fitzgerald, a move disclosed after Congress enacted a federal framework for fiat-referenced tokens.</p>\n<p>USA₮, or USAT, is designed to meet the new regime’s reserve and disclosure requirements. The legislative backdrop arrived on July 18 when the GENIUS Act was <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trump-signs-genius-act-into-law-activating-americas-first-regulatory-framework-for-stablecoins/\">signed</a>, setting monthly reserve attestations, high-quality liquid asset backing, and clear supervisory lanes for both bank and qualified non-bank issuers.</p>\n<p>The competitive field tightened further after Circle completed an initial public offering that raised about <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/circle-raises-1-05-billion-230325081.html\">$1.05 billion</a>, with shares priced at $31.</p>\n<h2>The near-term contest now centers on onshore distribution and reserve income</h2>\n<p>U.S. merchants and payment processors want tokens that fit cleanly within money-movement and treasury policies. This means monthly reserve certifications, bankruptcy-remote structures, and straightforward redemption mechanics.</p>\n<p>The GENIUS Act bans issuer-paid yield, which puts the commercial model on a float scale and operating efficiency.</p>\n<p>Circle’s structure routes most reserves into BlackRock’s Circle Reserve Fund, a money-market-style vehicle invested in short-dated Treasuries and repurchase agreements, while Tether has reported a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-reports-5-7-billion-profit-amid-record-127-billion-us-treasury-investments/\">large U.S. Treasury footprint</a> that has grown with stablecoin demand.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin transfer <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/stablecoin-volume-outpaced-mastercard-paypal-in-2022-as-digital-payments-wars-loom/\">volumes</a> reached multi-trillion levels this year, reminding treasurers that liquidity and chain coverage now matter as much as brand.</p>\n<p>Policy harmonization outside the U.S. will shape merchant access. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority closed its consultation on issuance and custody in July, with the Bank of England considering caps on systemic holdings. Per the FCA consultation <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-14-stablecoin-issuance-cryptoasset-custody\">CP25/14</a>, authorization, safeguarding, and disclosure are set to tighten in parallel with central bank oversight.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong’s licensing regime took effect on August 1 under the HKMA, and Singapore’s MAS framework for single-currency stablecoins already prescribes reserve composition, capital, and five-day par redemptions.</p>\n<p>A U.S. coin that fits GENIUS rules, a UK coin that meets FCA and BoE requirements, and an MAS-labeled instrument create a pathway for issuers to distribute across major financial hubs without bespoke workarounds.</p>\n<h2>Payments rails will be the practical governor of share capture through 2027</h2>\n<p>Visa has expanded stablecoin settlement to additional networks and to EURC, a step that helps issuers reach acquirers and cross-border payouts with less friction. PayPal extended PYUSD to Arbitrum and outlined Stellar plans, which shows how processors can pull settlement off congested chains when throughput and fees matter for merchant experience.</p>\n<p>Distribution through wallets, acquirers, and card networks puts a premium on integration speed, reporting, fraud tooling, and fiat off-ramps, not only on the unit economics of reserve yields.</p>\n<p>Monthly volumes in USDT and USDC already rival major electronic payment corridors, so small checkout routing or payment settlement improvements can shift token preference in merchant flows.</p>\n<p>The onshore float that fits the U.S. framework will set the scoreboard for the next two years, and the numbers drive clear ranges.</p>\n<p>A base case assumes $400 billion of U.S. onshore stablecoins by late 2026 and $650 billion by late 2027.</p>\n<p>In that path, USDC holds 60 to 65 percent of the onshore pool as a public issuer with established bank and fintech integrations, while USAT reaches 20 to 25 percent as U.S. listings, custody, and settlement partners come online.</p>\n<p>An upside path for Tether lifts the onshore pool to $450 billion by 2026 and $750 billion by 2027, with USAT rising to 30 to 35 percent if Anchorage and Cantor-linked plumbing accelerates adoption in U.S. venues.</p>\n<p>A more conservative path for Tether and faster bank adoption of USDC will push USDC to a 70 to 75% share of a smaller $550 billion pool by 2027.</p>\n<p>These are merchant and policy outcomes, not marketing narratives, and the driver is partner coverage across issuers, acquirers, and custodians.</p>\n<h2>Reserves tell the macro story that sits underneath market share</h2>\n<p>If U.S. onshore stablecoins reach one trillion dollars of float by 2027, the implied Treasury bill bid ranges from $600 billion to $900 billion, depending on whether issuers run 60 to 90 percent in bills.</p>\n<p>The composition matters because front-end yields respond to large, persistent buyers. According to the Bank for International Settlements, strong net inflows to stablecoins have been associated with a modest fall in three-month bill yields over short windows, while outflows show larger adverse effects.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has warned that an asset shift into bills can lower credit supply elsewhere, which introduces questions for bank funding models if stablecoins absorb deposits at scale.</p>\n<p>The U.S. law reframes how merchants and banks treat tokenized dollars. Monthly reserve disclosures and asset quality rules move these instruments near regulated cash equivalents in many treasurer policies, even as the law bans issuer yield.</p>\n<p>That policy architecture favors issuers that already speak the language of attestation and custody segregation. It also gives U.S. banks and broker-dealers a clearer footing for custody and settlement services, which matters for U.S. exchanges, money transmitters, and fintech lenders that handle customer funds.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/after-usdts-global-victory-circles-usdc-battles-tethers-usat-in-650b-usa-showdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin price</a> trades near $117,000 after the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, as the 1,065-day post-halving window approaches.</p>\n<p>The Fed cut rates by 25bps yesterday, placing Bitcoin’s near-term path at the intersection of policy and a cycle marker <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/16/bitcoin-price-pattern-halving\">Axios</a> says has historically captured a “final high” roughly 1,065 days after a prior cycle low.</p>\n<p>The test window runs through late September and early October, then the market will trade into Thanksgiving on flow, dollar, and rate dynamics that can either extend the advance or start the topping process that prior cycles paired with drawdowns of 40 to 60 percent, according to Axios.</p>\n<p>Spot ETF demand is the first lever to watch because it turns the cycle into a flow problem. According to CoinShares’ <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-etfs-attract-2-9-billion-in-fresh-capital/\">latest weekly fund-flow update,</a> U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw renewed net inflows in late August and early September, measured in billions of dollars, while SoSoValue tracked a mid-September multi-session inflow streak with a single-day print of around $260 million on September 15.</p>\n<p>Those figures contrast with the post-halving issuance of about 452 Bitcoin per day, calculated as 3.125 Bitcoin per block times roughly 144 blocks per day. When multi-day ETF demand absorbs several thousand Bitcoin per week, the market’s ability to distribute inventory at the highs narrows, and topping processes can lengthen into a plateau rather than a single peak.</p>\n<h2>Macro conditions set the second lever.</h2>\n<p>This month, the euro touched a four-year high against the dollar as cut expectations increased, while front-end Treasury yields eased into the meeting.</p>\n<p>A softer dollar lowers global financial conditions and often correlates with higher beta across risk assets. At the same time, domestic inflation has cooled from last year’s pace, with August headline CPI at 2.5 percent year over year and core at 3.0 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>The policy outcome will shape whether those tailwinds persist or fade. Throughout the rest of 2025, cuts with dovish language that emphasizes progress on inflation and downplays the need for quick reversals would support the dollar’s drift lower and extend the risk window.</p>\n<p>Cuts that emphasizes vigilance on inflation and a limited runway for further easing would keep rates sticky and reduce the impulse. A no-cut outcome was a low-probability branch, yet it would have tightened financial conditions into quarter-end and left ETF demand to carry more of the load.</p>\n<p>Mining economics frame how deeply price moves are transmitted to the supply side. Hashrate has hovered around 1.0 to 1.12 zettahash per second in recent weeks, with network difficulty near a record around 136 trillion, according to Hashrate Index tracking.</p>\n<p>That backdrop keeps <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-hashrate-at-record-margins-pinched-will-miners-sell-or-pivot-amid-ai-power-land%e2%80%91grab/\">hashprice</a> near 53 to 55 dollars per petahash per day, levels broadly consistent with Luxor’s spot readings this month. Because hashprice scales roughly with Bitcoin price and inversely with hashrate, bands for Q4 can be approximated by combining price paths with modest hashrate creep as new rigs energize. Fees remain a smaller component in the current lull, so price carries most of the signal into miner cash flow.</p>\n<p>A simple baseline clarifies the inputs that feed scenario bands through Thanksgiving, November 27.</p>\n<p>With those inputs, the grid below lays out price and miner hashprice ranges into late November across policy tone and ETF flow states. These are bands, not point targets, designed to reflect how cut tone and net flows propagate into price and miner revenue under low-fee conditions and modest hashrate growth.</p>\n<h2>The placement of the cycle clock matters for how those bands are interpreted</h2>\n<p>Axios frames prior “final highs” occurring near the 1,065-day mark, then transitioning to drawdowns that were less severe in the ETF era than in earlier cycles. That adds a second read-through for investors watching the tape into early October.</p>\n<p>My own analysis flagged Nov. 1 as a potential date for the cycle peak based on previous cycle peaks extending from the last halving by roughly 100 days.</p>\n<p>However, if the window delivers a high and ETF demand remains strong, the outcome can be a rounded top with shallower retracements.</p>\n<p>If the window passes without a new high and flows turn mixed, the market can migrate toward the middle cells of the grid where price oscillates under the prior peak while hashprice is constrained by gradual hashrate increases.</p>\n<p>Policy tone will color the flow of data almost immediately. Per Business Insider’s breakdown of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-rate-cut-this-week-fomc-powell-stock-market-outlook-2025-9\">meeting paths</a>, a dovish cut converts to an easier dollar backdrop and a steeper risk appetite curve, which historically pulls incremental demand into equities and crypto, while a hawkish cut narrows that curve and puts more weight on idiosyncratic flows.</p>\n<p>A no-cut outcome would have tested the lower bands in the table since it removes the near-term easing impulse and tends to firm the dollar. The CPI profile reduces the need for restrictive surprises, according to the BLS figures, yet the chair’s emphasis on data dependence can keep rate-path uncertainty in the foreground even if a first cut arrives.</p>\n<p>ETF flow streaks are the cleanest high-frequency metric to monitor against this policy backdrop. CoinShares’ weekly data provide size and regional composition, and SoSoValue’s daily tallies map whether the post-announcement sessions extend or fade the bid.</p>\n<h2>Translating those numbers into supply absorption is straightforward</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-cycle-clock-points-to-a-final-high-by-late-october-will-etfs-rewrite-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over the last week, the token has risen by 9%, signaling stronger interest from traders.</p><p>On the 12-hour chart, PENGU had broken out above a descending channel that had kept prices moving lower since late July. The breakout was confirmed as $0.032 held as support during the retest. Fibonacci levels suggest next targets around $0.047, $0.064, and $0.076, with extended projections pointing toward $0.096 if <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pengu-primed-for-liftoff-bullish-retest-signals-180-move-ahead/\">momentum continues</a>.

Bitcoinsensus noted,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$PENGU</a>Bullish Flag in Play!<p>After strong accumulation, price formed a massive flagpole</p><p>Now consolidating inside a bullish flag channel</p><p>Breakout target sits around $0.074 — momentum could send it flying</p><a href=\"\">#PENGU</a><a href=\"\">#Crypto</a><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/WhLBjh1C3W</a><p>— Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus)</p><a href=\"\">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote><p>At current levels near $0.037, that would mean more than doubling in price if the breakout confirms.</p><p>In addition, Momentum readings align with the bullish setup. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram has flipped positive, pointing to building strength on the upside.</p><p>The Stochastic RSI is trending higher at 78 and 66, close to the overbought range.

She embodies what Origin Summit is about: visionary IP with global reach, creative integrity, and cultural relevance,” said SY Lee, co-founder and CEO of Story. “We’re beyond excited to have her as part of the event, because K-POP DEMON HUNTERS showcases the full spectrum of what IP can be. It’s a global cultural movement. It drives music charts, sparks fandoms, inspires merchandise, and reshapes how stories move through the world. That’s the kind of programmable, participatory IP future we’re building toward.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Origin Summit </strong>is the premier institutional event at the intersection of AI, blockchain, finance, and intellectual property.

It had a $19 million theatrical debut, the largest in Netflix history, after already being on the service for 2 months.</p>\n<p>Its soundtrack produced eight Billboard Hot 100 hits, including the #1 single “Golden,” and earned acclaim as the first soundtrack in the last three decades to land three Billboard Top 10 Singles. Critics embraced the film as well, awarding K-POP DEMON HUNTERS a 97% Rotten Tomatoes score, making it the top-performing Netflix original film to date.</p>\n<p>Kang’s K-POP DEMON HUNTERS broke from convention by focusing on distinctly Korean influences while simultaneously rejecting a typical “female superhero” mold seen throughout media. Instead, Kang created funny, flawed, and relatable heroines that not only attracted viewers but also led to an immediate and enormous globally dedicated fandom.</p>\n<p>A veteran of the animation industry, Kang previously served as Head of Story on THE LEGO NINJAGO MOVIE and began her career at DreamWorks, where she contributed as a story artist to the SHREK, KUNG FU PANDA, TROLLS, MADAGASCAR, and CROODS franchises.

PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network.</p><blockquote><p>“Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.”</p></blockquote><p>This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains.</p><p>The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high.</p><p>This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide</p><p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p><p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p><p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.”</p><p><a href=\"https://tron.network/\">TRONNetwork</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.org/\"> TRONDAO</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/TRONDAO\">X</a> |<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\"> YouTube</a> |<a href=\"https://t.me/tronnetworkEN\"> Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/trondao\">Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/\"> Reddit</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/tronprotocol\"> GitHub</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.medium.com/\"> Medium</a> |<a href=\"https://forum.trondao.org/\"> Forum</a></p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-usd-expands-to-tron-network-via-layerzero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin’s current stability near $117,500 is being shaped almost entirely by retail investors, according to Binance’s latest trading data.</p><p>Inflows show that smaller transactions dominate.</p><h2>Retail Traders Dominate BTC</h2><p>In its latest report, CryptoQuant <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb7efd6e8c203d2e216927-Binance-Data-Bitcoin-Steadies-Near-117500-as-Retail-Inflows-Dominate-and-Whales-\">revealed</a> that inflows of 0-0.001 BTC recorded nearly 97,000 BTC, and those in the 0.001-0.01 BTC range amounted to about 719,000 BTC. This breakdown highlighted the retail-driven nature of the market, where numerous small contributions are providing liquidity and balance.</p><p>Despite the relatively modest size of these inflows, their collective weight has been sufficient to keep Bitcoin steady at the current levels. At the same time, the absence of large whale inflows, specifically transactions of 100 BTC or more, is notable. This lack of large-wallet activity indicates that the market is not being swayed by concentrated buying power but instead by broader retail participation.</p><p>On the positive side, such a pattern reduces the immediate risk of a sharp downturn often associated with whale selling, and gives Bitcoin a firmer footing in the short term. However, the dependence on retail activity also highlights a structural fragility since, if enthusiasm among smaller investors wanes or if whales suddenly re-enter with significant inflows, the market could face abrupt volatility.</p><p>For now, the balance between consistent retail inflows and muted whale activity has created a period of relative calm, which has allowed Bitcoin to consolidate near its highs. If this trend continues, the market could gradually build momentum toward testing the $120,000 level.</p><p>Despite this, there is still the looming possibility of whale intervention, which is capable of either accelerating upward momentum or triggering a rapid correction.</p><h2>Supportive Setup</h2><p>The retail flows come in the backdrop of the US Federal Reserve making the first interest rate cut for 2025.</p><p>Kushal Manupati of Binance said the 25 bp cut creates a supportive setup for crypto, which would <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">boost</a> BTC, ETH, and potentially large-cap alts if funding and ETF inflows remain stable. In a statement to <i>CryptoPotato</i>, the exec said</p><blockquote><p>“In crypto, that setup typically sustains demand for BTC and ETH and can expand to high-quality large-cap alts if funding and futures basis remain stable. Watch ETF inflows and on-exchange depth; if those stay firm, market breadth should improve rather than fade.</p><p>From here, labor and inflation data will determine whether another cut is likely this year or whether the Fed pauses. If Fed communication stays consistent, cross-border participation should increase across trading sessions.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/retail-traders-keep-bitcoin-floating-above-117k-but-one-whale-move-could-change-everything/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The asset is now testing the $3.11 mark, which lines up with a descending trendline that has capped price action for months. Analyst DefendDark noted,</p><blockquote><p>Breaking 3.1097?</p><a href=\"\">#XRP</a>on the daily RSI is strong, and the yellow resistance at $3.10 is getting weaker.<p>Believe</p><a href=\"\">#XRPArmy</a>.<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/q54guxL90z</a><p>— Dark Defender (@DefendDark)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>The daily RSI is pushing higher and remains below the overbought level, showing continued strength. The metric has also crossed above its moving average, which often points to building momentum. The price is also holding above the Ichimoku Cloud on the daily chart, a signal that often appears during trend shifts.</p><h2>Support Holds as Price Climbs</h2><p>XRP retested support near $3.03 on September 15 and bounced, indicating that buyers may have defended the level. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO stated,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">#XRP</a>Upper and Lower Targets :<p>▫️Lower Targets:</p><br/>Retesting and bouncing from $3.03 is still in the cards, but I believe the retest was completed on September 15th.

A close above this area would mark a key step in confirming further strength. From there, the next levels to watch are $3.30 and $3.40. The asset has also <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-set-to-smash-records-as-fed-cut-and-etf-excitement-build/\">broken out</a> of a falling wedge pattern, which tends to support upward movement.</p><h2>Larger Structure Points to Breakout Potential</h2><p>On the monthly chart, XRP continues to form a bullish flag, similar to the <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-mega-cycle-signals-repeat-of-2017-face-melting-rally/\">setup</a> that led to the 2017 rally. In that cycle, Ripple’s token rose more than 1,100%. If a similar move plays out, the projected target stands near $24.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1HyB_hWYAAxbfO.jpeg\"><graphic class=\"size-full wp-image-413011\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjAwIDU0NSIgd2lkdGg9IjEyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNTQ1IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFIeUJfaFdZQUF4YmZPLmpwZWciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTIwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSI1NDUiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"XRP price chart\" width=\"1200\" height=\"545\"/></a></p><p>Fibonacci levels above the current price include $8, $13, and $26.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Ethereum’s mid-sized whale cohort is sitting on massive paper gains, reaching levels not seen since the network’s last market peak almost four years ago.</p><p>Analyst CryptoOnchain has shared data showing wallets with between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH seeing unrealized profits rise to cycle highs, a sign that historically came right before selling pressure increased.</p><h2>Whale Wallet Profits Mirror Previous Market Top</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb10c16e8c203d2e2168c4-ETH-Unrealized-Profits-of-Mid-Sized-Whales-Hit-Levels-Last-Seen-at-ATH-in-Nov-20\">analysis</a>, this uptick in unrealized profits among average-sized whales highlights a stage in the cycle where investor psychology can significantly shape price action.</p><p>In previous instances, including the 2021 peak, such levels coincided with either large-scale profit-taking or, at a minimum, heightened selling pressure. While the data does not guarantee an imminent correction, it suggests that the market has entered a zone where whale decisions could dictate Ethereum’s near-term trajectory.</p><blockquote><p>“This does not necessarily mean an immediate correction,” wrote CryptoOnchain. “It highlights a critical stage in the cycle where investor psychology and whale behavior could heavily influence price action.”</p></blockquote><p>The timing of these gains is also notable. Ethereum has rallied more than 95% in the last year and 8.7% over the past month, and was trading at $4,591 at the time of this writing, just 6.9% below its record high of $4,946.</p><p>Furthermore, in the last week, ETH has oscillated between $4,404 and $4,762, with intraday swings between $4,440 and $4,637 in the past 24 hours. This ideally puts whales in a position of strength, as many of them accumulated at significantly lower levels during Ethereum’s consolidation phase.</p><p>Still, the market backdrop is complicating the whale picture. For example, as chartist Ali Martinez reported previously, big investors <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/90000-eth-in-just-2-days-is-ethereum-headed-for-a-big-correction/\">sold</a> 90,000 ETH worth more than $400 million in just 48 hours, leaving them with only 15.4 million tokens. Those moves may have been opportunistic profit-taking before yesterday’s Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">meeting</a>, but they also showed how quickly whale actions can change the market if sentiment turns.</p><h2>Institutional Signals and Price Trajectory</h2><p>Renewed institutional participation is also helping offset the risk of whale-driven sell-offs. Evidence of this was provided by CQ analyst PelinayPA on September 17, who highlighted that Ethereum’s Fund Market Premium (FMP), which compares futures prices to spot prices, has been steadily <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68caaaef756c0b23f07c4e61-Ethereum-Fund-Market-Premium-Signals-Strong-Institutional-Support-Above-68K\">rising</a> since July. That trend shows that institutional buyers are willing to pay more than the current price for exposure, which is often seen as a sign of long-term rallies.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the charts, ETH remains pinned below the $4,850 resistance level after months of climbing within a steep ascending channel, as <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis-can-eth-push-toward-5k-as-bullish-momentum-returns/\">noted</a> in <i>CryptoPotato’s </i>latest pulse check. The asset continues to print higher highs and higher lows, supported by a bullish moving-average crossover, yet momentum is fading as traders await a breakout.</p><p>If whales decide to lock in profits, ETH could revisit the $4,000 zone. But if they hold, or if institutions absorb the selling, analysts see a realistic chance of the altcoin breaking above $5,000 before the month’s end.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-mid-sized-whales-see-unrealized-profits-soar-to-2021-ath-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p><ul><li>The launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), described as a “spot ETF with extras,” has been among the most talked-about topics in the crypto community recently.</li><li>Ripple also teamed up with Franklin Templeton and DBS Bank, enabling trading between its RLUSD stablecoin and Franklin’s tokenized money market fund sgBENJI.</li></ul><h2>Breaking News Today</h2><p>Ripple has taken center stage lately, mainly due to the developments on the ETF front. As <i>CryptoPotato</i> <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-etf-launch-imminent-latest-updates-revealed/\">reported</a>, the REX-Osprey XRP exchange-traded fund (under the ticker XRPR) is scheduled for launch today (September 18).</p><p>While the issuer described the investment vehicle as a spot ETF, some industry participants identified features that distinguish it from other such products. The popular Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett claimed it will operate as a “spot ETF with extras.”</p><blockquote><p>“To my understanding, it’s a spot product in a ’40 Act wrapper that holds real XRP plus cash, Treasuries, and some derivatives. Basically a spot ETF with extras, and is more regulated than traditional spot products,” she said.</p></blockquote><p>Contrary to the upcoming product, spot crypto ETFs that have already been approved in the United States are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which governs commodity-based trusts. For a detailed breakdown of how REX-Osprey’s ETF compares to standard spot ETFs, please read our article <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-stalls-xrp-and-doge-etf-rollout-how-they-differ-from-btc-and-eth-counterparts/\">here</a>.</p><p>Grayscale has also displayed its intentions to introduce a product that tracks the performance of numerous cryptocurrencies, including XRP.</p><p>Earlier today, CEO Peter Mintzberg <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-approves-grayscales-digital-large-cap-fund-for-trading/\">said</a> the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards. He also added that the team is working “expeditiously” to launch the first multi-crypto asset ETP with BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA as underlying assets. </p><p>The GDLC is specifically designed to give investors exposure to some of the biggest cryptocurrencies, without requiring them to buy and store the coins themselves directly. It will track the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and will operate with daily cash creation and redemption of 10,000-share baskets.</p><h2>Ripple’s Prestigious Partnership</h2><p>In addition to the breaking ETF news, the company <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-dbs-bank-franklin-templeton-tap-xrp-ledger-to-launch-tokenized-repo-markets/\">shook hands</a> with the global investment company Franklin Templeton (which has over $1.6 trillion in assets under management) and the leading bank in Singapore, DBS Bank. </p><p>According to the signed memorandum of understanding (MoU), the financial institution will list sgBENJ and RLUSD. The former is a tokenized version of Franklin Templeton’s US dollar money market fund, while the latter is Ripple’s stablecoin, which is pegged to the greenback.</p><blockquote><p>“With this setup, eligible DBS clients can trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, enabling them to rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the official announcement reads.</p></blockquote><p>In the next phase of the collaboration, the Singaporean bank plans to explore helping clients unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/big-day-for-ripple-and-xrp-etfs-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The trading volume for the same period was over $1.7 billion. Over the past week, the token is up 5%. The price is now testing the top of a downtrend channel that has held since earlier this year.</p><p>Chart analysis shows that SUI is approaching the upper boundary of the structure.

A breakout would see SUI revisit the old All Time High area.”</p></blockquote><p>Notably, the previous high sits near $5.35. SUI has formed a series of higher lows in recent weeks. These moves suggest growing interest from buyers. The top of the channel, near $3.80, is a key area.

Below that, the next range sits between $2.33 and $2.00. This zone acted as a strong base earlier in the year and may do so again if tested.</p><h2>Google Partnership Adds Fuel</h2><p>Recent developments around the SUI network have drawn attention to the project.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin’s price is quickly recovering and paving its way toward a new all-time high after the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point and signals there are still more to come in the upcoming year. Therefore, investors’ fears are alleviated, and the market is likely to rally further in the coming weeks.</p><p>By Shayan</p><h2>The Daily Chart</h2><p>Bitcoin’s daily chart demonstrates a clear bounce from the $107K demand zone and a rise back above the 100-day moving average, located around the $113K mark. After yesterday’s Fed rate cut, the asset is continuing its path toward the $124K supply zone, which aligns with the current BTC all-time high.</p><p>The RSI is also trending above the 50% level, indicating that the momentum has now shifted bullish once again. All these signals point to a potential continuation toward the $124K ATH and likely a further rally toward $130K and even higher.</p><h2>The 4-Hour Chart</h2><p>As the 4-hour chart demonstrates, Bitcoin’s recent rally has occurred after the price successfully broke out of a descending channel, following a swift double bottom rebound at the $108K supply zone.</p><p>The asset has now swept the liquidity pool above the previous $107K high, which can lead to two possible scenarios. The market can either carry on with the uptrend and attack the $124K area once again, or it can pull back at least to the $112K order block, which is the most notable demand zone nearby. Yet, with the RSI still below the overbought region, the price seemingly has more room to grow before a correction occurs.</p><h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2><h3>Open Interest</h3><p>This chart displays the Bitcoin aggregate open interest, which shows the number of open perpetual futures positions. Typically, during bullish market conditions, this metric climbs higher or consolidates, as more and more traders are taking leveraged positions. This is exactly what can be seen on the chart.</p><p>Meanwhile, another interesting observation is that even with the market going through a short-term correction a few weeks ago, the open interest has yet to drop. While this is generally a bullish sign, it also points to the fact that the futures market might still be overheated. Therefore, there is still the probability for a liquidation cascade to happen in the short term, which could cause a flash crash before the market stabilizes again.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pl/bybit24/\">Use this link</a>to register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!<p>Disclaimer: Information found on CryptoPotato is those of writers quoted.

This marks tokenization’s “real breakthrough” – composability, or the ability to combine and reuse assets across different protocols.</p>\n    <p>Projects are already showing how this works in practice. Asset manager <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/maple-s-usd200-million-plasma-vault-gets-filled-instantly\">Maple Finance’s</a> syrupUSDC, for example, has grown to $2.5 billion, with more than 30% placed in DeFi apps like Spark ($570 million). </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/tradfi-and-fintech/centrifuge-surpasses-usd1-billion-in-tvl-as-broader-rwa-heats-up\">Centrifuge’s new deJAAA token</a>, a wrapper for Janus Henderson’s AAA CLO fund, is already trading on Aerodrome, Coinbase and other exchanges, with Stellar planned next. Meanwhile, Aave’s Horizon RWA Market now lets institutional users post tokenized Treasuries and CLOs as collateral. </p>\n    <p>This trend underscores a bigger shift: RWAs are no longer just copies of traditional assets; instead, they are becoming core parts of on-chain finance, powering lending, liquidity, and yield, and helping to close the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi.</p>\n    <p>“RWAs have crossed the chasm from experimentation to execution,” Sid Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, says in the report. “Our growth to $3.5B AUM reflects a broader shift: traditional financial services are adopting crypto assets while institutions seek exposure to on-chain markets.”</p>\n    <p>Investor demand for higher returns and more diversified options is mainly driving this growth. Tokenized Treasuries proved there is strong demand, with $7.3 billion issued by September 2025 – up 85% year-to-date. The growth was led by BlackRock, WisdomTree, Ondo, and Centrifuge’s JTRSY (Janus Henderson Anemoy Treasury Fund). Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix also further fueled adoption in 2025.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://thedefiant.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.thedefiant.io%2Fpasted-1758145219101-png-7267c3a6-008c-4e24-a1c4-0ec498e63f54.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=100\" alt=\"Tokenized Treasuries chart\"/>\n    <p>Investors are putting money into longer-term bonds, private credit, and stocks to get higher returns. At the same time, more people can join in, as open platforms and DeFi make these markets accessible beyond just institutions</p>\n    <p>Together, these changes show that RWAs are becoming an essential part of digital financial markets. The report notes that tokenization is “more than just representing traditional assets on-chain. By unlocking liquidity, expanding global access, and enhancing collateralization, it fundamentally transforms them.”</p>\n    <h2>Related Posts</h2>\n    <p>Advertisement</p>\n    <h3>Get an edge in Crypto with our free daily newsletter</h3>\n    <p>Know what matters in Crypto and Web3 with The Defiant Daily newsletter, Mon to Fri</p>\n    <p>90k+ Defiers informed every day.

The move comes as other networks, like <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/near\">NEAR Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/solana\">Solana</a>, push similar efforts to develop blockchain-based infrastructure for the AI economy.</p>\n    <p>In an <a href=\"https://x.com/DavideCrapis/status/1967573374911340975\">X post</a> on Monday, Sept. 15, dAI Team lead Davide Crapis, previously a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, said that the initiative will focus in two directions: First, building tools that let AI agents and bots transact and follow rules without intermediaries; Second, developing a decentralized AI stack so that future AI development doesn’t depend on a small number of centralized companies.</p>\n    <p>Part of the effort centers on ERC-8004, a <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098\">new Ethereum standard</a> and so-called “trust layer” in the works that’s meant to give AI agents something like an on-chain reputation score.</p>\n    <p>“This standard extends the Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) protocol with a trust layer that allows participants to discover, choose, and interact with agents across organizational boundaries without pre‑existing trust,” Crapis explained in a forum post describing the proposed standard.</p>\n    <p>With ERC-8004, instead of blindly trusting a bot, users would be able to check an agent’s identity, see how it’s behaved in the past, and confirm whether it meets certain requirements through registries stored on Ethereum. As Crapis added in the post, the Ethereum Foundation will work closely with the Linux Foundation and A2A ecosystem stakeholders to “refine and improve the specifications of this extension.”</p>\n    <p>Nick Johnson, lead developer at ENS, a protocol for blockchain-based domains, told The Defiant that the urgent challenge with AI is to develop “decentralised standards for agent identity and trust so autonomous systems remain accountable and interoperable.”</p>\n    <p>“In a future defined by AI agents transacting and collaborating on-chain, technologists must ask how signature protocols like those underpinning ENS can set the benchmarks for integrated identity and reputational transparency, rather than let centralised approaches dominate,” Johnson said in comments to The Defiant.</p>\n    <h2>Joining the Pack</h2>\n    <p>By creating a dedicated team to focus on decentralized AI and the future AI agent economy, the Ethereum Foundation joins other established players already working to become the go-to network for the decentralized AI economy.</p>\n    <p>NEAR Protocol has branded itself “the blockchain for AI,” developing frameworks like Shade Agents, which lets autonomous bots act across chains while keeping data private.</p>\n    <p>Alex Shevchenko, a former NEAR Protocol product manager and currently CEO of Aurora Labs, told The Defiant that there are “two intriguing use cases for AI on blockchain,” transferring value and research:</p>\n    <blockquote>“[T]he traditional financial system is not suited for AI agents, so there is a high chance that crypto would enable the AI economy. Another use case is AI research. At the moment, all AI research is siloed within businesses. This hinders network effects and is inefficient. Collaboration through decentralised, confidential machine learning is the way forward.”</blockquote>\n    <p>Solana is also equipping developers with an Agent Kit that allows them to plug AI models directly into <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/defi\">DeFi</a> and on-chain apps, enabling AI agents to autonomously manage trades, liquidity, and other DeFi and web3 activities, including <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/tag/nft\">NFT</a> creation and lending.</p>\n    <p>Unlike its competitors, SingularityNET, a blockchain protocol also explicitly focused on decentralized AI, has taken <a href=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/fetch-singularitynet-and-ocean-to-merge-assets-and-forge-shared-tokenomic-network\">the unification route</a>, teaming up with Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol to launch the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The Alliance is a shared AI playground where the three projects pool resources and give developers a single ecosystem to deploy AI without relying on centralized players.</p>\n    <p>Outside of crypto-native solutions, tech giant Google just yesterday <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol\">revealed</a> its own payments protocol for AI agents, AP2, from Google Cloud, promising a combination of TradFi payment methods and stablecoins.

The yield rate is dependent on activity on the Botanix network.</p>\n    <p>Yields are set to go live tomorrow, Sept. 18, with projections of up to 30% APY, according to a release shared with the Defiant.

From a monthly high of 0.0000146, the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/business/memecoins-gambling-dna-trojan-horse-crypto-adoption/\" auto-attrs>memecoin</a> had crashed 12% to 0.0000130 by Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the hack was even worse for BONE, which declined more than 43% in the same period.</p>\n<h2>Shibarium Devs Under Fire</h2>\n<p>In an announcement on Friday, Dhairyain sought to reassure Shibarium users.</p>\n<p>The project’s team had successfully frozen the 4.6 million BONE, he said, preventing any further attacks on the network or its bridge. As a precautionary measure, the team temporarily moved stake manager funds into a hardware wallet and suspended staking and unstaking.</p>\n<p>Post-hack, the SHIB Army has been critical of the project’s leadership.</p>\n<p>Tagging Shytoshi and Dhairyain, one X user <a href=\"https://x.com/Kripto_Fatihi_/status/1966971009770094876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>pointed<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> out that L2Beat highlighted Shibarium security concerns months ago. “Despite so much time passing, why haven’t the network deficiencies been fixed?” they asked.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, initial silence from Shibarium’s lead developer, Shytoshi, was met with criticism from the community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Why has @ShytoshiKusama been so quiet lately?” one user <a href=\"https://x.com/Yasei__Okami/status/1967486204099658239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>lamented<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>.</p>\n<p>“How can someone claim to be a leader if they’re vocal only during good times but absent when accountability is needed?” They added.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Shytoshi Kusama Responds</h2>\n<p>Responding to community outrage in a <a href=\"https://x.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1967672793526620471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>post<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> on Monday, Shytoshi said that “to suggest that I am anywhere except beside [other Shibarium developers] figuring out next steps is utterly preposterous.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Yes, we are on it, in the war room, so to speak,” he stressed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although he insisted the recent bridge attack has his full attention, Shytoshi acknowledged that he have been busy with other projects.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2025, the lead Shibarium developer has taken a step back from the L2, turning his attention to other projects and hinting at upcoming AI initiatives.</p>\n<p>For instance, updates to his X bio reference an upcoming whitepaper tying AI, SHIB, $SHY, and DAO roles. In an episode of his podcast in April, he discussed AI’s role in building “the operating system of the future.”</p>\n<p>Confirming his change of priorities, Shytoshi’s post on Monday said: “my focus now lies outside Shib as I push for AI initiatives to better all our tokens.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"ccn-you-may-like\" data-ui-impression data-tracking='{\"item_type\": \"internal-linking\"}'>\n    <p class=\"section-title\">Recommended Secure Partners</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<p class=\"ccn-vote blocks t-space _vote\">\n\t<span class=\"_text\">\n\t\tWas this Article helpful?\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"yes\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-positive\"></i>\n\t\t<em>Yes</em>\n\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"no\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-negative\"></i>\n\t\t<em>No</em>\n\t</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"_clear\"></span>                    </div>\n                </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/shiba-inu-shibarium-lead-dev-focus-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Liquidity across Ethereum and Linea, combined with MetaMask’s wallet-native integration, supports stability in everyday use. </span></p>\n<p><span>Arbitrage and redemption mechanisms help correct price drift, while reserve yield adds an extra buffer. However, risks remain if liquidity is shallow, audits lapse, or regulatory shifts impact operations, making transparency and adoption key to maintaining trust.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Key Features of mUSD</span></h3>\n<p><b>Native to MetaMask</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Seamless integration for swaps, transfers, bridging, and spending.</span></li>\n<li><span>Lower fees and faster transactions inside the MetaMask ecosystem.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Utility Across DeFi</b></p>\n<p><b>Real-World Spending</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Expected integration with the MetaMask Card for payments at Mastercard merchants worldwide.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Transparency &amp; Compliance</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Reserves are managed by Bridge under strict regulation.</span></li>\n<li><span>Regular audits planned to prevent trust issues like those seen with Tether.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>How to Buy, Sell, Swap, and Bridge MetaMask USD (mUSD)</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask makes it simple to manage MetaMask USD (mUSD) without relying on centralized exchanges. All core actions, such as buying, selling, swapping, and bridging, are built directly into the wallet for a seamless experience.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Buy mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>You can purchase mUSD directly in the MetaMask wallet using credit card, debit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal. </span></li>\n<li><span>Once purchased, tokens are delivered straight to your wallet on </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-blockchain-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>Ethereum</span></a><span> or Linea, with more network support coming soon.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Sell mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>MetaMask also supports easy </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/crypto-on-ramps-off-ramps-fiat-conversion-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>off-ramps</span></a><span>. </span></li>\n<li><span>You can sell mUSD and convert it back into cash, sending funds directly to your bank account, PayPal, debit card, or credit card. This eliminates unnecessary steps and keeps fees competitive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Swap mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Swapping mUSD is fast and transparent. MetaMask’s aggregator compares rates across multiple</span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/liquidity/\" auto-attrs><span> liquidity</span></a><span> sources, ensuring you get the best price. </span></li>\n<li><span>Gas fees are included in your quotes, so you always know the exact cost before confirming. mUSD can be swapped for thousands of tokens across Ethereum and Linea.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Bridge mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Need to move mUSD across blockchains? MetaMask’s bridge feature makes it secure and efficient. The system automatically finds the most cost-effective route, and with </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/cross-transfer-protocol-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>cross-chain swapping</span></a><span>, you can bridge and swap in one transaction.</span></li>\n<li><span>For example, sending mUSD from Ethereum and receiving another token on Linea in a single step. This makes managing mUSD across chains seamless, saving both time and transaction fees.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Why MetaMask Launched mUSD?</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask is not just chasing trends. Stablecoins are now one of the most profitable segments in crypto:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Tether </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/business/tether-financial-muscle-q2-billions-excess-reserves/\" auto-attrs><span>earned over $4.9 billion in Q2 2025</span></a><span>, while supply grew by $13 billion.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/tether-usat-token-us-launch-bo-hines-ceo/\" auto-attrs><span>USA₮, new U.S.-regulated stablecoin</span></a><span> announced by Tether.</span></li>\n<li><span>Circle’s USDC is widely used in DeFi and institutional finance.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/circle-arc-vs-stripe-tempo-vs-robinhood-l2-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>Circle is building Arc, a layer-1 blockchain</span></a><span> purpose-built for stablecoin finance (payments, FX, global settlement, etc.).</span></li>\n<li><span>PayPal entered the game in 2023 with PYUSD, backed by Paxos.</span></li>\n<li><span>Tempo, a blockchain being developed by Stripe (in collaboration with Paradigm), focused on payments, stablecoin-friendly rails, and higher throughput. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>So competition is no longer just about liquidity or backing. It’s about chain features (like native gas in stablecoins), compliance, cross-chain mobility, UX (easy buy/sell/swap/bridge), and how well one can integrate into real payments or business rails. mUSD’s wallet-native advantage is good, but that may not be enough unless the ecosystem keeps growing (liquidity, trading pairs, institutional usage).</span></p>\n<p><span>By launching mUSD, MetaMask can:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Capture a share of the stablecoin market revenue.</span></li>\n<li><span>Create tighter integration between its wallet, DeFi services, and payments.</span></li>\n<li><span>Position Linea as a go-to ecosystem powered by its own stablecoin.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Stablecoin Competitors: Can mUSD Stand Out?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The stablecoin market is crowded, with entrenched leaders and new challengers. For MetaMask USD (mUSD) to succeed, it must carve out space alongside giants like USDT and USDC, while differentiating from entrants like Tether’s USAT, PayPal’s PYUSD and World Liberty Financial’s USD1.</span></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/metamask-usd-musd-wallet-native-stablecoin-transak-stripes-bridge-m0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In a reorg attack, the normal transaction history of a blockchain is rolled back by an attacker who controls enough mining power.</span></p>\n<p><span>Essentially, a miner (or mining pool) with the majority of the network’s computing power can secretly create a longer alternative chain and then publish it. Because most cryptocurrencies follow the rule that “the longest valid chain is the correct one,” all other nodes switch to this new chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>This forces the network to discard the original blocks and any transactions they contained. The result can be dramatic: confirmed payments suddenly vanish and must be reprocessed, which opens the door to double-spending and undermines trust.</span></p>\n<p><span>For </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/xmr-price-breaks-out-monero-largest-ever-chain-reorg/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> and other </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/\" auto-attrs><span>proof-of-work (PoW)</span></a><span> coins, this kind of attack is essentially the same as a 51% attack, where one entity controls more than half of the mining power. In such a scenario, the attacker can block or reverse transactions and undermine the normal security of the blockchain.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Is a Blockchain Reorg Attack?</b></h2>\n<p><span>A </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/monero-jumps-7-despite-51-attack-reorg-kraken/\" auto-attrs><span>blockchain reorganization</span></a><span> attack happens when the transaction chain is rewritten in a way that invalidates some recent blocks. In normal operation, Monero nodes follow the longest chain rule: they always treat the longest valid PoW chain as the official ledger.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-foundation-reshapes-protocol-division-internal-rift/\" auto-attrs><span>In a reorg attack</span></a><span>, however, a miner with exceptional hashpower withholds newly mined blocks instead of broadcasting them immediately. Later, the attacker releases this hidden chain. If their private chain is longer than the public one, all other nodes switch to it as the canonical history.</span></p>\n<p><span>The “lost” </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/whats-inside-the-bitcoin-block/\" auto-attrs><span>blocks</span></a><span> and transactions from the old chain are dropped as if they never happened. For example, in the recent Monero incident, the attacker’s chain overtook the public network, forcing nodes to discard 18 blocks and more than 117 transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>This kind of attack can enable double-spending: the attacker can spend coins on the original chain and then invalidate those transactions when the new chain takes over. In short, a reorg attack exploits PoW’s longest-chain rule to rewrite history, and it typically requires the attacker to have a very large share of the network’s mining power.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Happened in the Monero Reorg Incident of September 2025?</b></h2>\n<p><span>In mid-September 2025, </span><a href=\"https://x.com/vinibarbosabr/status/1967202524810584454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Monero suffered its biggest blockchain reorganization in history</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. On September 14, 2025, the network unexpectedly “rolled back” 18 blocks, erasing roughly 36 minutes of transaction history.</span></p>\n<p><span>Independent observers quickly confirmed the event. Researchers reported that the reorganization began at block height 3,499,659 around 5:12 AM UTC and ended at height 3,499,676 about 43 minutes later. In total, around 117–118 previously confirmed transactions were invalidated (as if they never occurred) when the network switched to the attacker’s longer chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>The reorg was linked to </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/qubic-crypto-price-analysis-first-halving-breakout/\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic</span></a><span>, a mining pool and “useful proof-of-work” project led by Sergey Ivancheglo. Qubic had quietly accumulated an exceptionally large share of Monero’s mining hash rate — over 50%. By withholding blocks and then releasing its private chain, Qubic overrode the public Monero blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite reversing many transactions, Monero’s price actually rose 5–7% on the day, possibly because investors saw that no coins were double-spent or stolen. Still, the event marked the deepest reorganization on record for Monero.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because Monero’s protocol always accepts the longest chain as valid, the network had no choice but to accept Qubic’s chain. All blocks mined by honest miners during those 18 blocks were orphaned, and their transactions were sent back to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/mempool/\" auto-attrs><span>mempool</span></a><span>. In practice, this meant that some users and businesses saw their Monero payments reversed.</span></p>\n<p><span>The incident also shattered the conventional wisdom that waiting for 10 confirmations is enough to finalize a Monero transaction. Analysts noted that ten confirmations no longer provided sufficient assurance after this event. Many exchanges and services temporarily raised their confirmation thresholds to avoid processing risky transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>By the time the dust settled, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/monero-51-attack-qubic-pool-dogecoin-mark-tehrani-warns/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> developer and user community was alarmed but not panicked. Researchers confirmed that this rollback was the largest in Monero’s 12-year history and quickly pointed out that it was nearly a repeat of a smaller attack from the previous month.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Has Monero Faced Reorg Attacks Before?</b></h2>\n<p><span>Yes, Monero had a close call just weeks earlier.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>In August 2025, the same </span><a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604908675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic pool targeted Monero with a smaller-scale reorg</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. Qubic announced that it had performed a 6-block chain reorganization on Monero, orphaning about 60 blocks of history. This move suggested Qubic briefly controlled a majority of the hashing power.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>Exchanges reacted immediately. For example, </span><a href=\"https://www.coinglass.com/fr/news/535253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Kraken publicly stated</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span> that it paused Monero deposits as a “security precaution” after detecting a single pool with over 50% hash power.

It was an expensive gadget, but one that set the stage for Apple’s rise to trillion-dollar dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Eighteen years later, Apple’s latest flagship, iPhone 17, arrives at a familiar-looking $799. On paper, the price hike is modest compared to the revolution under the hood: bigger displays, pro-grade cameras, AI chips, and more storage than entire PCs of the mid-2000s.</span></p>\n<p><span>The real drama emerges when the familiar U.S. dollar is swapped for a very different yardstick: cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what if <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/it/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhones were priced<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> not only in dollars, but also in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP at the time of each launch? Suddenly, the narrative takes an unexpected turn. In certain years, an iPhone would cost only a fraction of a cryptocurrency unit, while in fiat, it would demand an enormous amount.</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s because you’re really watching two things move: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-google-device-cameras-next-wave-mobile-ai/\" auto-attrs>Apple’s pricing strategy</a> and each coin’s cycle of booms, busts, and everything between.</span></p>\n<p><span>\n<div class=\"toplist-table-container js-toplist-container inner-toplist\" data-list-container data-tracking='{\"list_version_id\":null,\"list_id\":\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\",\"list_type\":\"external-linking\",\"list_length\":3,\"list_placement\":\"content\"}' data-ident=\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\" data-country=\"us\">\n            <p class=\"section-title\">Try Our Recommended Crypto Exchanges</p>\n<p class=\"t-label\">\n            Sponsored        </p>\n<p class=\"disc-icon\">Disclosure<i class=\"ccn-icon-disclosure\"></i></p>\n<p class=\"disc-tooltip\">\n        We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you.

Pricing something stable, like an <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2025/06/11/iphone-prices-through-the-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhone<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>, in coins rather than dollars makes that volatility tangible.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunity cost lessons</b><span>: Looking back, “spending” BTC or ETH on consumer goods in early years feels like burning treasure. The first iPhone you bought with crypto could today be worth millions, or even billions, in foregone gains.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inflation counterpoint</b><span>: While headlines often talk about <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-slammed-for-sending-inaccurate-ai-new-notifications/\" auto-attrs>iPhone</a> inflation, the real “inflation” often comes from the numéraire (the unit of account) you’re measuring it in.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>iPhones Priced in USD, BTC, ETH and XRP At Launch</span></h2>\n<p><span>For launches with multiple models, this article used the standard (non-Pro) version and the official U.S. street release date (e.g., iPhone 13 on Sept. 24, 2021). </span></p>\n<p><span>Crypto prices reflect approximate daily closing values for that date (or the nearest available trading day). “N/A” indicates the coin was not yet widely traded.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>* 2008–2013 Apple heavily marketed $199 on a two-year contract. Unlocked pricing was significantly higher.</span></i></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-4-year-cycle/\" auto-attrs>BTC had only just begun trading in 2010</a>; the $199 “price” at a few cents per BTC yields thousands of coins, an illustration of illiquid, nascent-market pricing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Apple’s advertised iPhone 12 base was $799, but the SIM-free price many buyers paid was $829; the $799 figure is the canonical launch headline.</span></p>\n<h3><span>What the Timeline Shows</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Early 2010s:</b><span> BTC was tiny; the iPhone’s “BTC cost” was enormous (thousands of BTC in 2010).</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2013–2016:</b><span> XRP appears (2013), ETH launches (2015). Their low early prices make the “coin cost” look huge compared with today.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2017 bull cycle:</b><span> BTC/ETH soared; the BTC/ETH needed for an iPhone collapsed into fractions.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2022 bear market to 2024–2025 recovery:</b><span> BTC and ETH rebounded strongly, pushing the coin amounts per iPhone even lower. XRP rose sharply into 2025 as well.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Bitcoin Pricing Highlights How Volatility Shapes Perceived Costs</span></h2>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-price-climbs-trend-question/\" auto-attrs>BTC pricing</a> exposes how volatility in crypto can dramatically reshape perceptions of cost, especially for something as familiar as an iPhone.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Bitcoin Cycles and Consumer Costs</span></h3>\n<p><span>Pricing iPhones in Bitcoin often reflects Bitcoin’s own cycles more than Apple’s pricing decisions. For example, the iPhone 6s “cost” almost 2.75 BTC in 2015, while the iPhone 13 was down to 0.019 BTC in 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span>Apple hasn’t drastically reduced its prices, what changes is Bitcoin’s value, which swings the perceived “cost” of a $799 phone by an order of magnitude, depending on the month and year.</span></p>\n<h3><span>ETH and XRP Trends</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/digital-asset-treasury-companies-bitcoin-ethereum-solana/\" auto-attrs>Ethereum and XRP</a> follow their own trajectories.
