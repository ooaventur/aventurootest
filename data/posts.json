Earlier, it announced that it had struck more than 150 \"terror targets\" across Gaza City in two days.</p>\n    <p>Israel says its aim is to defeat up to 3,000 Hamas fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\" and free its hostages.</p>\n    <p>But the offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p>\n    <p>The heads of more than 20 aid agencies have called on world leaders to act, saying \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\" and calling for \"urgent intervention\".</p>\n    <p>For days, huge columns of Palestinians have streamed southwards from Gaza City in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings, and on foot.</p>\n    <p>Until now, they have been forced to flee down a single coastal road to an Israel-designated \"humanitarian area\" in al-Mawasi.</p>\n    <p>But on Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that it would open a second route to leave, down the central Salah al-Din road. It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST).</p>\n    <p>Many Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey. Some say renting a small truck now costs around 3,000 shekels ($900; £660), while a tent for five people sells for about 4,000 shekels.</p>\n    <p>Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, told the BBC: \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent.\"</p>\n    <p>\"It took us 10 hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\"</p>\n    <p>Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" they are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly 2 million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6cfc/live/e2439b50-939f-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A map shows the evacuation orders across Gaza. A small strip of lands on the coast is the only area Palestinians are being told to go to. \"/>\n    <p>Some Palestinians who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents and so returned north.</p>\n    <p>The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.</p>\n    <p>As part of its operations, the IDF is reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely.</p>\n    <p>They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, families of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - protested near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Tuesday and Wednesday, arguing that the offensive would endanger their loved ones.</p>\n    <p>\"All day long, you boast about killing and destruction,\" said Macabit Mayer, aunt of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman. \"Bringing down buildings in Gaza - who are you bringing these buildings down on?\"</p>\n    <p>\"Could it be that you are bringing these buildings down right now on Gali and Ziv and all the souls left there - the living and the deceased?\"</p>\n    <p>The offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation, with UN human rights chief Volker Türk describing it as \"totally and utterly unacceptable\" and UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper calling it \"utterly reckless and appalling\".</p>\n    <p>But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to offer tacit support for Israel's operation during a joint press conference with Netanyahu on Monday.</p>\n    <p>He said the US preferred a negotiated end to the war, but that \"sometimes when you're dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that's not possible\".</p>\n    <p>It came as a United Nations Commission of Inquiry concluded that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4rxjppl8o\">Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>. </p>\n    <p>Among its findings were that Israeli security forces perpetrated sexual and gender-based violence, directly targeted children with the intention to kill them, and carried out a \"systemic and widespread attack\" on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-e26c7357-09f8-42af-81ae-42cbaf04b593\">religious, cultural and education sites</a> in Gaza.</p>\n    <p>Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".</p>\n    <p>Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>\n    <p>At least 64,964 people have been killed by Israel during its campaign since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.</p>\n    <p>With famine having already been declared in Gaza City by a UN-backed food security body, the UN has warmed an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx270y1rgzeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Difficult moments in those last days. But I was very confident I will stay here because this is where I want to play and want to be.</p>\n    <p>\"Max [Eberl, Bayern sporting director] and the coach really wanted me. It was very tough but in the end we got it, so I'm very glad.</p>\n    <p>\"I've watched Bayern all my life. It was a dream to join this massive club. When they called me I was excited and ready to come and play for them.\"</p>\n    <p>Yet, this on-off-on transfer saga is only over for now, because the deal - a loan with an obligation to buy - does not appear watertight.</p>\n    <h2>Will Jackson join Bayern permanently?</h2>\n    <p>Jackson joined Bayern Munich on deadline day for a £14.3m loan fee - close to a world record amount for a temporary deal - with a conditional obligation to buy for £56.2m.</p>\n    <p>Only the loan moves that took Alvaro Morata from Chelsea to Atletico Madrid and then from the Spanish club to Juventus commanded bigger fees.</p>\n    <p>However, according to widespread German media reports, the conditions to make the loan deal permanent are difficult to meet.</p>\n    <p>Uli Hoeness, the former striker who is an influential figure on Bayern's board, told Sky Germany during the international break: \"He won't play 40 games from the start.</p>\n    <p>\"We still have 32 Bundesliga games. If we reach the Champions League final, which we hope we will, that adds 13 games. The total is 45 games.</p>\n    <p>\"The DFB Pokal [German Cup] games do not count. So he would have to start all these games. He will go to the Africa Cup of Nations in January, so he can't start 40 games.\"</p>\n    <p>Further clarification has been given that any appearance of 45 minutes or more would count as a \"start\" for Jackson.</p>\n    <p>Hoeness also claimed Jackson's Epic Sport agency, led by Ali Barat, paid the extra £1.3m added to the loan fee by Chelsea in the 48 hours before deadline, while leaving open the possibility that the Senegal striker could return to west London next summer.</p>\n    <p>When asked about the arrangement at his unveiling press conference, Jackson said: \"It's not my decision, my job is just to play on the pitch, make my team win and score as many goals. My focus is only on trying to win big things.\"</p>\n    <p>Regardless, Chelsea are pleased with the finances involved and such a high loan fee could incentivise Bayern to buy Jackson next summer.</p>\n    <p>Bayern sources have also indicated that, if Jackson performs well and displays a positive attitude over the year-long loan, he will find a permanent home in Bavaria.</p>\n    <p>Their plan is for him to both compete with and complement star striker Harry Kane.</p>\n    <p>Jackson made his debut as a half-time substitute for the German champions during their 5-0 win over Hamburg on Saturday, replacing Serge Gnabry and playing alongside the England captain.</p>\n    <p>\"I thought he looked sharp,\" said Kane. \"In training, he's looked really good. It's not easy coming into a team like us when we're so well-drilled.</p>\n    <p>\"He physically is very strong and fast. And if he plays, he'll be eager to impress. But I don't want to put too much pressure on him too soon.</p>\n    <p>\"He knows he's working his way into the team. So far he's had a great attitude and the willingness to learn is the most important thing.\"</p>\n    <p>Jackson can play as a number nine or on the left wing, so has options in terms of position. And at Bayern, he escapes the pressure of needing to be the main goalscorer, while his proximity to the England captain can only benefit him in the future.</p>\n    <p>\"My wish is that he scores a lot of goals for us. I think he'll achieve that,\" said Bayern boss Vincent Kompany.</p>\n    <p>The ball is now in Jackson's court. He can either impress and stay at one of the world's biggest clubs or follow a similar path to Jadon Sancho, who returned to Manchester United for a £5m penalty fee as Chelsea escaped their previous £20m obligation-to-buy agreement.</p>\n    <h2>Why didn't it work out at Chelsea?</h2>\n    <p>Both Chelsea and Jackson's entourage argue the forward's time at Chelsea was a success.</p>\n    <p>Chelsea banked on three months of exceptional form at Villarreal and decided to trigger his £32m release clause in 2023. He had more than doubled in value over in a two-year period.</p>\n    <p>Jackson had only been a professional footballer for five years - six years prior to his move to Chelsea, he was playing on sandy amateur pitches in his Senegalese hometown of Ziguinchor.</p>\n    <p>Everyone knew Jackson was a rough diamond, having played just 1,758 minutes of top-flight football, but he quickly established himself as Chelsea's starting striker.</p>\n    <p>Understandably, given the pace of his rise, there were times when Jackson struggled.</p>\n    <p>According to Opta data, Jackson underperformed his expected goals by a score of -7 over the past two seasons, which is the second-worst total in the Premier League, behind only Leeds United striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.</p>\n    <p>Poor finishing drew criticism from fans, and he is known to have suffered under that pressure. Jackson would have runs of scoring goals but then experience long barren spells.</p>\n    <p>When asked about his exit, Maresca said: \"Nico is a Bayern Munich player. I sent him a message and wished him all the best. He worked well when he was here. That's all I can say.\"</p>\n    <p>But Jackson also outscored Chelsea legend Didier Drogba in his first season - netting 14 goals to the Ivory Coast striker's 10. He then scored 21 goals in his first 50 games to equal one of Africa's great strikers at Stamford Bridge.</p>\n    <p>The Blues are likely to make substantial profit, whether his move is made permanent to Bayern or he eventually ends up elsewhere, so Jackson and Chelsea's scouting team have some justification in believing his time at Stamford Bridge was a success.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ced5llve21qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She opened it the following morning. It was brief and to the point.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for your service. You know, you're fired, basically,\" Harris said, summarizing the missive.</p>\n<p>President Trump was attempting to remove Harris from her seat on the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent, quasi-judicial agency that hears federal employees' appeals of personnel actions taken by the government. The email came despite the fact that Harris' term was not set to expire until 2028, and despite a federal law that dictates board members can only be fired for cause, such as inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty.</p>\n<p>\"It was so obviously against the law,\" said Harris, an appointee to the board of former President Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>She sued the Trump administration and was briefly reinstated — twice. But the Trump administration appealed, and in late May, the Supreme Court handed the administration a win, issuing<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf\"> an emergency order</a> allowing her firing to stand while litigation continues.</p>\n<p>Eight months into his second term, it's clear that Trump is not just draining the swamp, firing bureaucrats he sees as problematic. He's upending entire systems and knocking down checks on presidential power.</p>\n<p>Along the way, his administration has racked up more than 300 lawsuits, a number of which will end up at the Supreme Court. A decisive legal victory for Trump in a case like Harris' could bring monumental change to government, beyond anything the country has seen in more than a century.</p>\n<h3>A firing at a 'good government' agency</h3>\n<p>That Trump chose to fire a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board is significant. The agency, little-known outside the government, was created by Congress as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to ensure that federal employees are protected against abuses by agency management.</p>\n<p>\"We are one of a few agencies that I call the good government agencies,\" said Harris, who, prior to serving as a board member, spent more than 20 years at a law firm representing both federal employees and federal agencies before the board.</p>\n<p>\n                Cathy Harris keeps a \"Lawyer of the Year\" award from the Metropolitan Washington Employment Lawyers Association on her wall.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Maansi Srivastava/NPR\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>The board is staffed by administrative judges, who hear cases, and headed by three board members, who act as appellate judges. The board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve seven-year terms. No more than two of them can be from the same political party, and they can only be fired for cause, according to rules set by Congress.</p>\n<p>Given this setup, the Merit Systems Protection Board has long been referred to as an independent agency, existing within the executive branch but with some degree of independence from the White House. Now that's in question.</p>\n<p>Harris said her firing doesn't send a good signal to those bringing cases before the board.</p>\n<p>\"If you know that the president can fire the board members at any time for no reason at all, is that going to impact the board members' decision-making?\" she said. \"I hope it wouldn't, but I think it could.\"</p>\n<h3>The Supreme Court's views on presidential power</h3>\n<p>\n                President Trump speaks to members of the media as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office on Sept. 5.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Harris' case is one of a number of cases currently in litigation that pose a key question: How much say does the President have over staffing within the executive branch?</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority provided a window into its present thinking on the matter, writing in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf\"> an emergency order</a> in Harris' case: \"Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, see Art. II, §1, cl. 1, he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions.\"</p>\n<p>While this decision is not the final word on the matter, lawyers close to the Trump administration are confident the president will prevail.</p>\n<p>\"There's a, I think, quite a strong Article II argument that the president has the authority to remove anybody who wields basically any modicum of authority,\" said James Burnham, an attorney who served in the first Trump administration and as general counsel for Trump's Department of Government Efficiency until June.</p>\n<p>\"Anyone who is wielding his power, who's wielding derivative executive power that comes from the president, needs to be removable at will, because if they have for-cause protections, then they basically cannot be fully and properly supervised,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Harris resoundingly rejected this argument.</p>\n<p>\"Our country is built on a separation of powers, a balance of powers, and when you give the president unfettered power, you're taking away the power from Congress. Congress put me in this job,\" she said. \"The president can pick his lawyers, but he can't pick who's going to judge cases.\"</p>\n<h3>A president willing to exert his authority</h3>\n<p>Under the logic that the Trump administration is pushing in court, only those who do not exercise federal power over regulating the public in any meaningful way could permissibly have removal protections, said Burnham.</p>\n<p>\"One example would be very low level people — the receptionist in the U.S. Attorney's Office,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Burnham acknowledged that this view represents a departure from the past.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know that you've had past presidents that were as willing to exert their authority in this way,\" he said, including Trump himself in his first term.</p>\n<p>\n                James Burnham is an attorney who served in the first Trump administration and as general counsel for Trump's Department of Government Efficiency until June.<br/>\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Maansi Srivastava/NPR\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Burnham said something changed in the four years after Trump first left the White House: the fact that the Biden administration tried to put Trump in prison.</p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors brought two separate criminal cases against Trump, for mishandling classified documents in Florida and trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>Both those cases have been dropped, but Trump has not forgotten them.</p>\n<p>This year, soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department moved to fire government attorneys and other staff members<strong> </strong>involved in the prosecutions of the former president.</p>\n<h3>A question of independence</h3>\n<p>Trump's firings have also extended to watchdogs known as inspectors general, who investigate reports of waste, fraud and abuse within their agencies, as well as heads of independent agencies beyond the Merit Systems Protection Board, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p>Asked whether these agencies should no longer be called independent if Trump is allowed to fire their members for any reason, Burnham said he doesn't think they've ever been independent.</p>\n<p>\"The removal protections have been unconstitutional from the beginning,\" he said.</p>\n<p>This question — whether Trump can in fact remove all these people — is likely going to get a full hearing before the Supreme Court in the coming months. The decisions the court issued so far are emergency stays, meant to be temporary.</p>\n<p>But even if the Supreme Court goes another way once it hears arguments in the cases, it's hard to see how you put things back together, now that so many people have been removed, the players on both sides said.</p>\n<p>\"I think the president would say that that's a virtue,\" said Burnham. \"But I also think that the administration is extremely likely to prevail at the Supreme Court on all the issues where they've issued stays so far.\"</p>\n<h3>The Office of Special Counsel is independent no more</h3>\n<p>Already, even without a Supreme Court decision, one watchdog agency has lost its independence.</p>\n<p>The Office of Special Counsel, a role created by Congress nearly 50 years ago alongside the Merit Systems Protection Board, investigates claims about wrongdoing in the government, including whistleblower complaints.</p>\n<p>The Office of Special Counsel is a separate entity from the special counsels appointed by the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Hampton Dellinger, who was appointed Special Counsel by Biden and confirmed by the Senate in 2024, was investigating the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary employees when Trump fired him on February 7.</p>\n<p>\n                Hampton Dellinger was appointed Special Counsel by former President Biden and confirmed by the Senate in 2024.

Phillipson, meanwhile, is seen as a Keir Starmer loyalist.</p>\n    <p>Powell, the MP for Manchester Central and former cabinet minister, lost her role as leader of the Commons in the recent reshuffle. According to a survey by LabourList, Powell is 17 percentage points ahead of Phillipson in the contest.</p>\n    <p>Asked if her campaign was essentially a “stalking horse” for Burnham, she told BBC’s Political Thinking podcast: “It’s just Westminster bubble obsession that, isn’t it?</p>\n    <p>“Really, you’ve got two strong women in an open and transparent contest. And instead of talking about the two strong women, everybody’s talking about this being a sort of proxy for war between two men, which, quite honestly, I find kind of sexist.”</p>\n    <p>She had warned previously that the contest must not be turned into a shadow battle between Burnham and Starmer, telling the Manchester Evening News: “Woe betide anyone who wants to try and tell me that I’m subservient to some other man. I’m probably more alpha male than most men I know.”</p>\n    <p>Powell insisted her aim for the deputy Labour leadership was to unite Labour’s values with the voters its politicians claimed to serve.</p>\n    <p>Asked if she would be proposing ideas before Rachel Reeves’s budget, Powell said: “I think it’s really important that I don’t, and we don’t in this contest try and sort of write some alternative budget or some alternative policy programme.</p>\n    <p>“But I am here to say, look, let’s communicate much more strongly what our values are, what our motivations are, whose side we are on, and connect that back to our communities through our great movement which is our strength.”</p>\n    <p>Powell, who once described herself as an “egg-breaker”, said it was clear lifting the two-child benefit cap “would be the single biggest policy we could do to address child poverty” and she urged ministers to be clearer about wanting to scrap it, adding: “The question is how and the when.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>She added that her campaign drew lessons from her Manchester constituency, where older, working-class voters in the outskirts of the city coexisted with younger professionals in the centre. “It’s how we unite them together,” she said. She argued it was wrong for Labour strategists to be focused only on one type of voter, or attempting to “out-Reform” Nigel Farage’s party.</p>\n    <p>Powell said it was a “kind of shock but not a total surprise” to lose her cabinet job as Commons leader, but she claimed maybe she was passing on too much honest feedback to No 10.</p>\n    <p>“I know I’m not really in the in-crowd, and I don’t really sort of play some of the parlour games,” she said. “I had fed back things that weren’t, with hindsight – maybe I thought I was doing the job I was supposed to be doing – but maybe that wasn’t feedback people wanted to hear.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/lucy-powell-hits-out-at-sexist-talk-that-she-is-labour-proxy-for-andy-burnham\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The UK prime minister will practise the art of tactful diplomacy emphasising mutual advantage and historical alliance. Most of the words in that sentence mean nothing to a president who is fluent only in self-interest.</p>\n    <p>Given the likelihood of miscommunication between two men from such different political cultures – the showbiz demagogue and the lawyer technocrat – relations have been remarkably friendly and, in Downing Street’s estimation, fruitful.</p>\n    <p>The contrast in styles has been turned to an advantage. The prime minister’s quiet solicitousness makes no competitive claim on the president’s limelight.</p>\n    <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/17/keir-starmer-curious-relationship-trump-ukraine-talks-zelenskyy-russia\">has praised Starmer</a> as a “good man” with a “beautiful accent”. He has agreed trade terms that are marginally less vindictive than the tariff regime applied to the rest of Europe. British lobbying has been instrumental in softening White House disdain for Nato and nudging the president towards scepticism about Vladimir Putin’s motives in Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>Managing the transatlantic relationship is one of the few things Starmer’s shrinking band of loyalists confidently cite as an achievement. Privately, some of the prime minister’s Tory opponents concede the point. But in the restive ranks of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> party, and a broad swath of public opinion, Trump is seen as a monster whose flimsy favours are not worth the price in national self-abasement.</p>\n    <p>Anyone hoping the state visit may include some hint of official rebuke for the honoured guest’s authoritarian character will be disappointed. Flattery and regal pomp to secure Britain’s status as Trump’s most esteemed tributary are the whole point.</p>\n    <p>Pre-cooked deals on nuclear and tech cooperation will be unveiled. Awkward differences on foreign policy – Britain’s imminent recognition of a Palestinian state; the US’s continued indulgence of Russian aggression – will not be aired in public.</p>\n    <p>Not by the prime minister, at least. No amount of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/trump-uk-analysis-normal-rules-of-state-visits-do-not-apply\">Foreign Office contingency planning</a> can insure against Trump’s capacity for unscripted sabotage. Even if the personal affection for Starmer is sincere, it is an outlier emotion in a man whose power base throbs with hostility to Labour Britain.</p>\n    <p>The prime minister can only pray that those prejudices don’t surface in some spontaneous televised riff on popular Maga themes – repression of free speech via social-media content regulation; submersion of indigenous white folk in a rising migrant tide. Even if that doesn’t happen, the hazard reveals a flaw in the policy of uncritical intimacy with an inherently unreliable regime.</p>\n    <p>The case for Starmer’s method is that Britain’s economic and security interests are inseparable from US power and will remain so for the foreseeable future. To attempt strategic decoupling out of distaste for an incumbent president would be myopic self-indulgence. Such influence as a junior ally might have over a prickly protector needs to be exercised sparingly in private. The more openly dissenting approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/emmanuel-macron-criticises-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland\">sometimes showcased</a> by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, doesn’t get results. Besides, France is part of the EU. Brexit puts Britain in a different category in Trump’s mind and, it is said, thereby affords unique opportunities.</p>\n    <p>A version of this argument was <a href=\"https://www.ditchley.com/sites/default/files/61st%20Annual%20Lecture%20delivered%20by%20Lord%20Mandelson%20%20-%20transcript.pdf\">set out in a speech</a> by Peter Mandelson, shortly before his dismissal as ambassador to Washington last week. The thrust was that the 21st century will be shaped by superpower rivalry between the US and China. The winner will be the one that dominates in the fields of AI, quantum computing and other such innovations with awesome dual-use military applications. Britain is disproportionately competitive in this field, given its size.</p>\n    <p>In short, the UK is bound by common interests and post-Brexit realpolitik to join Team USA when the only alternative is a world order dictated by the Chinese Communist party. “Like it or not, our US partnership has become indispensable to the functioning of our nation,” said Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>That perspective will continue to shape the government’s foreign policy regardless of who is the ambassador to Washington. It contains some truth about the new technological arms race but, more importantly, it goes with the deep grain of Britain’s postwar Atlanticist bias. It also brushes aside any obligation to work harder at reintegration with the rest of Europe, which is a fiddly multilateral process. It has complex moving parts and a tendency to start awkward conversations about labour migration. Starmer is making incremental progress in his reset of EU relations. Negotiations on agricultural trade, defence and energy cooperation are ongoing. But the mechanics of cosying up to the White House are simpler and the reward in political gratification comes quicker.</p>\n    <p>Trump does deals briskly, but he undoes them just as fast. His word is not a bond. His commitments are conditional. Preferential treatment for British business might be promised, but not delivered, or partly implemented, and one day reversed. The president signed agreements in his first term that count for nothing now. His modus operandi is extortion, the classic protection racket. He inflicts pain – tariffs for foreign governments; lawsuits or bureaucratic harassment for domestic companies – and offers to relieve the suffering in exchange for some commercial advantage. Paying up encourages the bully to come back for more.</p>\n    <p>This is the economic corollary to Trump’s political assault on judicial independence, pluralism and the rule of law. British citizens might not be directly threatened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-national-guard-democratic-run-memphis\">deployment of the national guard</a> to US cities under the guise of law enforcement or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/los-angeles-ice-raids\">paramilitary immigration force</a> that kidnaps people from the streets, but that doesn’t mean the corrosion of democracy in the US has no bearing on UK interests.</p>\n    <p>For one thing, the Maga project provides a template that Nigel Farage is admiring, ready to implement something along the same lines if Reform UK ever form a government. Denying them that opportunity will be easier if arguments against authoritarian nationalism have been rehearsed in advance of the general election campaign.</p>\n    <p>That case should be made in principle, but it applies also to pragmatic calculations of geopolitical influence. Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master. Fealty to the super-potentate across the Atlantic is an all-in gamble. There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p>\n    <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate?

Its conclusion is unsurprising, with few states in history having been so brazen about their intentions. To take just two examples: in May, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/hamas-israel-hunger-war-in-gaza\">Israeli finance minister</a>, Bezalel Smotrich, said that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed”; <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/pm-said-to-tell-mks-israel-destroying-homes-in-gaza-so-palestinians-have-nowhere-else-to-go-but-outside-the-strip/\">a week later</a>, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that Israel is “destroying more and more houses [in Gaza, and Palestinians accordingly] have nowhere to return”.</p>\n    <p>At the beginning of this month, Labour’s deputy prime minister and former foreign secretary, David Lammy, <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/49215/documents/262248/default/\">wrote a letter</a> to the chair of the international development committee, Sarah Champion, declaring that “the government has carefully considered the risk of genocide”, and has not concluded that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. How can two bodies come to such different endpoints? The British government has not come to a conclusion on genocide, because if it was to, it would have to face up to its complicity.</p>\n    <p>At the level of foreign and military policy, the British government works in alignment with the US, Israel’s strongest ally. The UK continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/30/uk-sale-f-35-fighter-jet-parts-israel-lawful-high-court\">supply Israel </a>with crucial components for the F-35 jets incinerating Gaza and its people. <a href=\"https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/revealed-uk-labour-israeli-military-planes-land-gaza\">Israeli planes</a> involved in this bombing have been allowed to land in the UK. The UK government continues <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-still-sharing-intelligence-israel-surveillance-flights-over-gaza-continue\">to share intelligence </a>with Israel. Britain operates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/07/uks-surveillance-flights-over-gaza-raise-questions-on-help-for-israeli-military\">relentless surveillance flights </a>over Gaza. And rather than impose sweeping sanctions, British ministers facilitate trade with <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/688abde61affbf4bedb7b105/israel-trade-and-investment-factsheet-2025-08-01.pdf\">Israel worth £6bn</a> a year.</p>\n    <p>While Israeli president Isaac Herzog – whose genocidal utterances about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/16/the-language-being-used-to-describe-palestinians-is-genocidal\">collective Palestinian guilt</a> were repeated by soldiers on the ground – is awarded the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/starmer-and-israeli-president-had-tough-exchanges-over-gaza\">honour of an official visit</a>, hundreds of peaceful protesters holding placards opposing genocide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/07/almost-900-people-arrested-at-palestine-action-protest-say-met-police\">have been arrested</a> as though they are dangerous extremists.</p>\n    <p>Every action taken against Israel has been performative, in order to dampen calls for action from the public. After all, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">seven in 10 British people</a> think it’s likely Israel has committed war crimes, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2024/04/04/8aa72/1\">a majority</a> supports an arms embargo, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/52694-british-attitudes-to-the-israel-gaza-conflict-july-2025-update\">only a fifth</a> think Israel’s attack on Gaza is justified, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/50197-support-in-western-europe-and-us-for-icc-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israeli-and-hamas-leaders\">and over half</a> support Netanyahu’s arrest for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Sanctioning two of the most extreme Israeli ministers – the aforementioned Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – makes no impact on the state’s genocidal war machine, and recognising a Palestinian state amounts to nothing more than a welcome symbolic gesture.</p>\n    <p>The lives of those living in Gaza are deemed less important than maintaining relations with Israel and, by proxy, the US. At the personal level, on Labour’s doorsteps, this approach plays out in the most callous of ways. Dalloul al-Neder is a Palestinian refugee from Gaza, who was a constituent of the former deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner. He got to know her, meeting several times: <a href=\"https://x.com/owenjonesjourno/status/1751706247311524178\">she visited his takeaway shop</a> in 2019 and posed for pictures, declaring “Palestine must be free”. She took him on a tour of parliament.</p>\n    <p>Within weeks of the genocide beginning, in October 2023, his mother, brother, sister-in-law and two young nieces were killed by an Israeli airstrike. Desperate to evacuate his wife and four-month-old daughter – who had been buried under rubble three times by Israeli attacks – he emailed Rayner twice to seek help evacuating his family. He says received no response.</p>\n    <p>In January 2024, he attended a Labour fundraiser in Stockport addressed by Rayner and her colleague, Jonathan Reynolds, and got to his feet, clutching pictures of his dead mother, begging her to support a ceasefire, emotionally declaring “I lost my family in Gaza”. The whole tawdry episode is on camera: he was aggressively ejected from the meeting and on to the street. Rayner did nothing, except to say “thank you, you’ve made your point”. She then unfollowed him on social media. Days later, she was <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/labours-angela-rayner-no-longer-goes-out-because-of-threats-and-was-scared-by-protest-confrontation-13062124\">interviewed by Sky News’ Beth Rigby</a>, who framed the incident as an example of the threats politicians face, linking it to the murder of the MPs Jo Cox and David Amess. Since then, so many of Neder’s relatives have been slaughtered by the Israeli state that their names take up three pages of a notebook.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-10\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Imagine if an Israeli citizen had been aggressively ejected from the fundraiser of a politician they knew well, after clutching photographs of their slaughtered family and begging for the violence to end. Rather than being framed as an example of the dangerous abuse suffered by politicians, the resulting uproar would be splashed on newspapers and lead news bulletins.</p>\n    <p>Our government is shirking away from uncomfortable truths. It denies genocide, because admitting it would mean confessing their own complicity. The truth, as they say, will out.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Starmer announces 'tech prosperity deal' with US, as Microsoft announces £22bn AI investment in UK</p>\n    <p>Britain and the US have struck a tech deal that could bring billions of pounds of investment to the UK as President Donald Trump arrived for his second state visit, PA Media reports. PA says:</p>\n    <p>Keir Starmer said the agreement represented “a general step change” in Britain’s relationship with the US that would deliver “growth, security and opportunity up and down the country”.</p>\n    <p>The “tech prosperity deal”, announced as Trump arrived in the UK last night will see the UK and US co-operate in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>It comes alongside £31bn of investment in Britain from America’s top technology companies, including £22bn from Microsoft.</p>\n    <p>Microsoft’s investment, the largest ever made by the company in the UK, will fund an expansion of Britain’s AI infrastructure, which Labour sees as a key part of its efforts to secure economic growth, and the construction of the country’s largest AI supercomputer.</p>\n    <p>Brad Smith, vice chairman and president of the firm, said it had “many conversations” with the UK government, including No 10, “every month”, adding that the investment would have been “inconceivable because of the regulatory climate” in previous years.</p>\n    <p>“You don’t spend £22bn unless you have confidence in where the country, the government and the market are all going,” he said. “And this reflects that level of confidence.”</p>\n    <p>Microsoft is backing tech firm Nscale to contribute towards developing a major data centre in the UK, which the company said would help build out Britain’s cloud and AI infrastructure.</p>\n    <p>Asked how much electricity capacity would be required for the build-out and how this would be supplied, Smith said: “We already have the contracts in place for the power that will be needed for the investments that we’re announcing here.”</p>\n    <p>Officials said the investment enabled by the tech partnership could speed up development of new medicines and see collaboration on research in areas such as space exploration and defence.</p>\n    <p>Starmer said: “This tech prosperity deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and delivering growth, security and opportunity up and down the country.”</p>\n    <p>Four arrested after images of Trump and Epstein projected on to Windsor Castle ahead of president’s visit</p>\n    <p>In the Commons yesterday MPs debated the decision to sack Peter Mandelson as the UK ambassador to Washington last week because new emails revealed that his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile sex trafficker, was closer than he had previously disclosed. One MP said Donald Trump must think the UK government “complete plonkers” for their handling of this because, by sacking Mandelson, Keir Starmer has put Epstein back at the top of the UK news agenda just ahead of Trump’s arrival. And Trump, of course, is deeply embarrassed about his own past friendship with Epstein.</p>\n    <p>British protesters are doing their best to ensure Trump can’t ignore the story. Four people have been arrested after images ofTrump alongside Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle last night. Reuters has more here.</p>\n    <p>Starmer is not the only leader Trump will be meeting who has “sacked” a close ally over his Epstein links. King Charles, continuing an approach adopted by his mother, the late Queen, has excluded his brother, Prince Andrew, from playing a role in public life follow the scandal about Andrew’s own links with Epstein.</p>\n    <p>An image of Donald Trump alongside disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein projected by the campaign group Led By Donkeys on Windsor Castle last nigh. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</p>\n    <p>Donald Trump to meet the King as protesters gather in London and Windsor</p>\n    <p>Good morning. Official Britain is laying out the red carpet for Donald Trump today. It is the first full day of his unprecedented state visit, and he will spend it with King Charles at Windsor Castle enjoying the finest pageantry the nation can lay on. Keir Starmer, like other Western leaders, has concluded that the key to getting positive outcomes from Trump is flattery and shameless sucking up, and (not for the first time) the royal family is being deployed to this end.</p>\n    <p>But civic Britain will also have its say on Trump today, and – perhaps mindful of his obsession with big crowds and his (supposed) love for free speech – there will be protests all over the country, with the main one in London. When Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president in the Trump’s first administration, was asked he felt about being booed one night when he attended the theatre, he said that was “the sound of freedom”. Trump’s response to protesters is much darker. But there is almost no chance of his hearing “the sound of freedom” today; his state visit is taking place entirely behind closed doors.</p>\n    <p>I will be focusing largely on the state visit today, but I will be covering non-Trump UK politics too.</p>\n    <p>Here is our overnight story about Trump arriving in the UK.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street denies there is a choice to be made between restored relations with Brussels and Washington, but Trump is a jealous master. Fealty to the super-potentate across the Atlantic is an all-in gamble. There is an opportunity cost in terms of strengthening alliances closer to home, with countries that respect treaties and international rules.</p>\n    <p>That tension may be avoided if Trump’s reign turns out to be an aberration. He is old. Maybe a successor, empowered by a moderate Congress, will reverse the US republic’s slide into tyranny. It is possible. But is it the likeliest scenario in a country where political violence is being normalised at an alarming rate? What is the probability of an orderly transfer of power away from a ruling party that unites religious fundamentalists, white supremacists, wild-eyed tech-utopian oligarchs and opportunist kleptocrats who cast all opposition in shades of treason?</p>\n    <p>These are not people who humbly surrender power at the ballot box, or even run the risk of fair elections. They are not people on whose values and judgment Britain should be betting its future prosperity or national security.</p>\n    <p>Here is the timetable for the day.</p>\n    <p>11.55am:Donald Trump arrives at Windsor Castle by helicopter. His programme than includes a carriage procession through grounds (at 12.10pm), a ceremonial welcome (at 12.20pm), a visit to Royal Collection exhibition (at 2.15pm), a tour of St George’s Chapel (at 3pm) and a beating retreat ceremony and flypast (at 4.20pm).</p>\n    <p>2pm: Anti-Trump speakers address a rally at Portland Place in London, before staging a march to Parliament Square.</p>\n    <p>Evening: Fox News broadcasts an interview with Trump.</p>\n    <p>8.30pm: Trump attends the state banquet at Windsor Castle.</p>\n    <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm BST at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p>\n    <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p>\n    <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-king-charles-windsor-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-keir-starmer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Imma have to talk to HR... [eating] turtle and bullfrog is WILD.\"</p>\n    <p>She quickly faced backlash on both English and Chinese social media platforms.</p>\n    <p>Ms Townsend, who is the world's top-ranked doubles player, later apologised saying: \"There's no excuse, there's no words and, for me, I will be better.\"</p>\n    <p>\"I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences, which is one of the things I love so much about what I do,\" she said in a video posted to Instagram on Wednesday, adding that she had \"the most amazing experience\" at the tournament.</p>\n    <p>Townsend had a day earlier taken to Instagram to share her reaction to some of the food she saw being served at a restaurant, including dishes like braised soft-shell turtle with fish maw and dry pot bullfrog.</p>\n    <p>These are considered traditional delicacies in China, particularly in the south.</p>\n    <p>\"These people are literally killing frogs... bullfrogs. Aren't those poisonous? Aren't those the ones that be giving you warts and boils and stuff? And turtles?... All in all I'd give this like a solid two out of 10 so far, because this is crazy,\" Ms Townsend said then.</p>\n    <p>She also posted another video where she appeared to be at a buffet with her teammate Hailey Baptiste, with the two making fun of a sea cucumber dish.</p>\n    <p>She was quickly called out on social media.</p>\n    <p>\"Won't defend Taylor here, clearly offensive and shocks a lack of understanding [that] there are different cultures other than USA,\" said one user on X.</p>\n    <p>\"It's really offensive to mock other people's cultural food,\" said another.</p>\n    <p>Chinese social media quickly caught light of her comments, and the hashtag \"American tennis player publicly insults Chinese food\" started trending.</p>\n    <p>\"When you go overseas, respect the local customs and culture. You can choose not to eat it. There is no need to belittle our food,\" said one comment on Weibo.</p>\n    <p>The latest backlash comes less than a month after Ms Townsend got into a heated confrontation with her Latvian rival Jelena Ostapenko in which the latter said she had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c2l745x0wvvo\">\"no class\" and \"no education\"</a>. </p>\n    <p>Ms Ostapenko apologised but denied being racist, saying her comments were in reference to tennis etiquette. \"But I understand how the words used could have offended many people beyond the tennis court,\" she wrote in an Instagram post.</p>\n    <p>Ms Townsend and her teammates are due to face Kazakhstan for the quarter finals on Thursday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx270m57zm7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Like that of the federal government, NPR's fiscal year begins Oct. 1.</p>\n<p>At NPR and many member stations, listener contributions have spiked up significantly. They are helping to make up for the cuts, at least in the short term.</p>\n<p>But the dynamics are so volatile that officials privately say it's hard to know where the public radio system's finances will land, or how long that generosity will last.</p>\n<p>NPR News spoke to seven people with direct knowledge of events for this story. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about internal network matters.</p>\n<p>So<strong> </strong>NPR has not yet revealed its larger strategy or much detail about the budget that addresses the new financial circumstances. NPR officials declined several requests to comment for this story. Maher and her leadership team are holding an all-staff meeting with employees Wednesday.</p>\n<p>According to three of the people with direct knowledge, NPR plans to make trims totaling more than $5 million over the course of the coming fiscal year to bring its annual budget into balance. It does not plan layoffs or major programming shifts.</p>\n<h3>Public radio stations seek more help</h3>\n<p>Maher is offering $8 million in relief to stations hardest hit by the cost of paying for NPR's programs. She says that figure has not required cuts; NPR appears to have anticipated giving that level of relief and is already doing so this year, according to testimony from a top network official in its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413094/npr-public-radio-lawsuit-trump-funding-ban\"> lawsuit against the Trump administration</a>.</p>\n<p>Some local NPR station officials say their applications have been received and processed promptly. Many, however, argue they will need more help from the network. A tracker set up by a public radio consultant has identified <a href=\"https://www.semipublic.co/p/introducing-the-public-media-layoffs\"> 332 layoffs in public media</a> since July 18, when the Republican-led Congress, at President Trump's urging, defunded public media.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/benjamin-mullin-b99abb35_after-trumps-cuts-crippled-npr-and-pbs-activity-7372605001325780992-3Rdb?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAB91b0BakuuTKmXlgSzUTCFIqDVZDWUq6o\"> first reported by Ben Mullin</a> of the </p>\n<p><i>New York Times</i>, an association of two dozen NPR and PBS stations in Florida wrote to Maher and the NPR board asking for greater</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>relief and more transparency around NPR's efforts to raise more money.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\"Simply put, the fee relief plan NPR has proposed is not sufficient to keep many NPR programs on the air in much of Florida,\" the association's members wrote. \"We understand NPR plans to revisit the fee model for [fiscal year 2027], but none of us can wait that long. The state and federal funding cuts are already impacting us, and we are making decisions now about our... budgets and program schedules.\"</p>\n<p>In June, Florida eliminated nearly $6 million in state funding for NPR and PBS stations.</p>\n<p>NPR has invested funds and effort in new collaborative reporting endeavors allowing stations to coordinate their efforts. It has emphasized efforts to raise money in ways that would share donations locally. And it has sought new revenues as well.</p>\n<p>NPR Music has placed an experimental \"donate now\" button on Tiny Desk Concerts, including last Friday's session with Ed Sheeran. (Funds are to be shared with local stations.) And on Tuesday, NPR named Sonali Mehta - a who got her start in the music business at YouTube - as NPR Music's Executive Director.</p>\n<p>At WNIN Tri-State Public Media, owner of a small public radio and television station based in Evansville, Indiana, officials were confronted by the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/15/nx-s1-5465110/how-public-broadcasting-funding-cuts-would-impact-one-rural-indiana-station\"> loss of state funding from the Indiana legislature</a> in April even before Congress made its move. Donors responded swiftly, doubling the level of contributions received from April to August compared to the same period in the previous year.</p>\n<p>That hasn't completely covered the station's combined loss of $1.5 million from federal and state coffers - but it has kept the station from having to tap its rainy day fund so far. Instead, WNIN president and CEO Tim Black announced Tuesday it is cutting five positions, or about a fifth of his workforce.</p>\n<p>Black says NPR and PBS made \"generous\" reductions in the cost to the station to run their programs; other public radio syndicators, including those behind <i>This American Life</i> and <i>Hidden Brain</i>, offered to waive costs for the upcoming year to continue broadcasting their shows.</p>\n<p>\"We were never going to get away from our core PBS and NPR shows,\" Black says. \"The fee reductions helped to cement that decision.\"</p>\n<h3>Three stations pull back from NPR network</h3>\n<p>The public radio network currently has 244 member stations. That figure is down by two from last year, as stations in Alabama, Oregon and Florida have dropped their affiliation with NPR, while one in Baltimore has signed up.</p>\n<p>The number of stations that may shutter could reach 70 to 80, according to Maher and outside consultants.</p>\n<p>Outgoing NPR board chairperson Jennifer Ferro said that people interested in public media trust it deeply, even at a time when trust in major institutions, including the media, has hit all-time lows.</p>\n<p>\"This is going to require us to work differently,\" Ferro said at an open session of Friday's board meeting, \"to trade in an old business model, for new collaborations, shared services, and a new way for us to do what we're here to do - which is to serve our communities.\"</p>\n<p>Ferro also delivered a vote of support for Maher.</p>\n<p>\"She believes in the power of our system, and she knows that for NPR to succeed, stations must succeed,\" Ferro said.</p>\n<p>The NPR member station in Huntsville, Ala., announced last week it would drop its affiliation with the network and stop broadcasting its shows on Oct 1. WLRH, which is formatted as a classical music station when it is not airing major shows from NPR, said it would devote more resources to local programming.</p>\n<p>\"WLRH staff will be working together to get back to the station's roots of focusing more on our long-standing existing local programs, as well as developing new programming to better reflect our community,\" the station said in an announcement. \"The WLRH audience will hear more local news, arts, culture, classical music and music of all genres, and original storytelling.\"</p>\n<p>Stations in coastal Oregon and in Panama City, Florida are also dropping their affiliation with NPR.</p>\n<p>Such moves are not all in one direction: NPR's executive in charge of station relations informed the board at an open session Friday that classical station WBJC in Baltimore owned by a community college would affiliate with NPR.</p>\n<p>Yet the closures are hard to predict.</p>\n<p>After the finance committee of Penn State University's board of directors declined to transfer the public radio station it owns to WHYY in Philadelphia, the university decided to shut it down by the end of next June. The transfer proposal included a plan to pay $17 million over five years to help WHYY absorb the costs. Trustees cited the loss of federal funding in making the decision to shut down WPSU.</p>\n<h3>CPB and NPR financial relationship about to end</h3>\n<p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Congress set up more than a half-century ago to distribute federal money to public television and radio stations, is to effectively shut down on Sept. 30. A bare-bones staff will remain for several months to wind it down.</p>\n<p>Until now, PBS (like local PBS stations) has typically received about 15% of revenues from federal sources. PBS has lost money for educational projects for children from the U.S. Education Department as well as its CPB funding; PBS officials announced earlier this month it was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5529431/pbs-cuts-15-of-jobs-in-wake-of-federal-funding-cut\"> cutting 15% of its jobs</a>.</p>\n<p>NPR received far less money directly from the federal government <strong>– </strong>about 1 to 2% of its budget in a typical year.</p>\n<p>CPB last year committed to award NPR a $1.96 million grant toward a new initiative designed to assure fairness in the network's coverage and to bolster public trust after a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/09/1243755769/npr-journalist-uri-berliner-trust-diversity\"> veteran editor accused NPR of ideological bias</a>. That claim had helped fuel a public outcry and a </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5339951/npr-pbs-congress-hearing\">to kill taxpayer funding for the network's programs.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>According to the CPB, it has so far paid just $550,000 – or a bit more than a quarter of the promised amount. It says it is working to fulfill payments on the editorial review and other contractual obligations.</p>\n<p>The initiative includes a new editorial review desk in which senior editors scrutinize almost all NPR news coverage before it is broadcasted, streamed or posted. NPR is hoping to receive the money in CPB's waning days but unsure if it will.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5539164/npr-public-media-funding-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>UK overall inflation remains at 3.8% in August, but food price growth climbs for fifth month in a row - business live</p>\n    <p>Food prices rise at fastest rate since January 2024 with vegetables, milk, cheese and fish going up; Bank of England expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday</p>\n    <p>Tom Lancaster, land, food and farming analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said:</p>\n    <p>Food price inflation is once again up, after the hottest spring and summer on record has hit UK farmers ability to grow crops and feed their animals, with the UK again facing one of its worst harvests in decades.</p>\n    <p>Although this extreme weather will only be part of the story in these price rises, the signature of climate change is clear. And it’s not just British grown foods such as beef, milk and vegetables that are rising, but also prices for food and drink like chocolate and coffee too, both driven up by extreme weather linked to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Central banks are clear that climate change increases food prices in ways they cannot control or predict, creating systemic risk to our food system. There is no monetary policy lever they can pull to address this. Only by reducing our emissions to net zero and bringing balance back to our climate will we limit the impact of climate change on food prices in the future.</p>\n    <p>Food prices rise at fastest rate since January 2024</p>\n    <p>Food prices rose for the fifth month in a row – after the hottest spring and summer on record which damaged harvests – to an annual rate of 5.1%, up from 4.9% in July and the highest since January.</p>\n    <p>Vegetables, milk, cheese and fish became more expensive, while bread and cereals and oil and fats became cheaper.</p>\n    <p>Ticket prices were up by 2.1% between July and August, compared with a rise of 22.2% at this time last year. This was due to the different timing of flights in relation to school summer holidays, particularly return flights from Europe. Last year, these return flights from Europe fell during the school term in July, but this year they were during the school holidays in July, making them more expensive this year.</p>\n    <p>This was offset by higher prices at restaurants and hotels, and fuel costs. Prices at restaurants and hotels rose by 3.8% year on year in August, up from 3.4% in July.</p>\n    <p>The biggest upward effect came from accommodation providers, especially from overnight hotel stays priced the previous day, where prices fell this year by less than an ear ago. There was also a smaller upward effect from canteens.</p>\n    <p>The average petrol price rose by 0.3p a litre between July and August to 134.2p, compared with a fall of 2.1p a litre last year. Similarly, diesel prices rose by 0.8p per litre to an average of 142.p, against a 2.6p per litre drop last year.</p>\n    <p>I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.</p>\n    <p>Through our Plan for Change we are taking action — raising the National Living Wage, extending the £3 bus fare cap, and expanding free school meals, to put more money in people’s pockets while we work to build a stronger, more stable economy that rewards hard work.</p>\n    <p>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</p>\n    <p>UK inflation stayed steady last month, keeping households under pressure with petrol prices rising.</p>\n    <p>The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, remained at 3.8% last month, the same as in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was in line with what economists had predicted.</p>\n    <p>Air fares rose by less than year while prices at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel, were higher.</p>\n    <p>The core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, fell to 3.6% in July, also as forecast by economists.</p>\n    <p>With growing inflationary pressures, financial markets are widely predicting the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged at 4% on Thursday.</p>\n    <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 3.8% in the 12 months to August 2025, unchanged from July 2025.</p>\n    <p>Donald Trump landed at London Stansted last night for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK.</p>\n    <p>The US president and the first lady, Melania Trump, touched down onboard Air Force One ahead of a series of events over the next two days, including being hosted by King Charles, military parades and a possible flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets.</p>\n    <p>It comes amid criticism in the UK of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, with the Stop Trump Coalition gathering for a protest in Windsor on Tuesday and the group planning another demonstration in central London on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p>\n    <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p>\n    <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p>\n    <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p>\n    <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p>\n    <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p>\n    <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p>\n    <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p>\n    <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/labour-growth-far-right-economy-andy-haldane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This includes travelling, overnight stays and packing and shipping customer orders. Without this support he says he would not be able to run his company.</p>\n    <p>The Access to Work grant was providing him with a support worker five days a week, but on reassessment, it was reduced to one day.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"They're basically with me all the time. They help me in every facet of helping me do my job and without them, I can't do any of that.\"</p>\n    <p>Josh has appealed the decision and has not had any support since the start of July, when his grant ran out, despite no change in his personal circumstances.</p>\n    <p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work\">Access to Work scheme</a>, companies and employees can apply for grants to help support disabled people in the workplace.</p>\n    <p>The programme can pay employees and businesses for the extra costs associated with being a disabled worker - things that go beyond what is legally required by employers to provide. It covers a range of things like paying for taxis, assistive technology and British Sign Language interpreters.</p>\n    <p>Disabled people have told the BBC their awards have been significantly reduced, completely taken away and in some cases left them forced to shut their businesses and turn down job offers.</p>\n    <p>Josh is currently managing by using his own money to keep the business afloat, but says things are \"very tight\" and he'll only be able to do this for the next few months.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not getting everything done that I used to get done,\" he says. \"There's so much to do that it's just so hard to stay on top of it... it's just really frustrating.\"</p>\n    <p>Josh says Access to Work helped him get into work and set up his own business, but is fearful of what will happen if that is taken away.</p>\n    <p>\"It's scary to think that I'm a disabled entrepreneur, helping disabled people and potentially being deprived of doing that.\"</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c705nxgqvv8o\">Jobs fears as disability scheme owes businesses thousands</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y9mm333p2o\">'I don't want to live on benefits, I want to work'</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w1p44vzleo\">Plans to help benefits recipients into work 'a mess', say DWP officials</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\"We have a system that's making it very difficult for you to remain in work,\" he adds.</p>\n    <p>Campaign group Access to Work Collective was set up in response to problems people were facing when applying or reapplying for grants.

The social enterprise employs 25 neurodiverse adults and uses Access to Work to support most of them.</p>\n    <p>Lexie O'Connor has been at the cafe since it opened in 2019. In between customers she explains how working at the cafe has given her confidence and a sense of pride and now trains others on how to work with neurodiverse and disabled staff.</p>\n    <p>Lexie's reapplication took 10 months to come through and when it did the hours for her one-to-one support worker had been greatly reduced, leaving the business to make up the shortfall.</p>\n    <p>\"A lot of employers in that time physically would not be able to manage keeping people like myself employed,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Lexie says she sees a lot of her colleagues worry about their job prospects because of the problems with Access to Work. The cafe has said it already had to let two members of staff go because support was cut.</p>\n    <p>\"We're worrying so much about it, it's affecting the quality of work that we worked so hard to get to in the first place.</p>\n    <p>\"I feel like places like Sea Change are trying their best, they are fighting for people like me.\"</p>\n    <h2>'Set up to fail'</h2>\n    <p>Ministers have widely acknowledged Access to Work as a key driver in getting disabled people in work, but in an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0ltkvh7\">interview with the BBC</a>, minister for social security and disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said the problem was the \"huge numbers of people wanting it\", adding they had been struggling \"to keep up with the demand\".</p>\n    <p>Spending on the programme increased by 41% in 2023-24 to £257.8m.</p>\n    <p>In February 2025 about 62,000 applications were waiting to be processed, with 33,000 people awaiting payment, according to the DWP.</p>\n    <p>A government consultation on Access to Work closed at the end of June with ministers currently reviewing what a new scheme could look like.</p>\n    <p>​​Angela Matthews, director of public policy and research at BDF called on the government to make access to work \"more efficient and more resourced\".</p>\n    <p>​​She told the BBC: \"Disabled people are set up to fail and so are employers, because disabled people won't get what they need to be able to work and employers won't have the means or the support to provide an inclusive workplace for disabled people.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1db5/live/154dd430-924b-11f0-b9c5-fd64e0842f34.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Contributor handout This is a close up shop of Diana staring and smiling directly into the camera. &#10;She is standing infront of a blue and white backdrop. \"/>\n    <p>Member of BDF, Allianz UK, said despite the size of the insurance business, it had not been immune to the struggles with Access to Work.</p>\n    <p>Diana Salmon, head of occupational health and safety at the firm, says the biggest issue has been the long waits for awards to be processed. In some cases people are waiting longer than 10 months to start work.</p>\n    <p>Diana says: \"It [the delays] could put people off applying to us... so we do our best but we can't afford really to pick up the high support costs.\"</p>\n    <p>She referenced a recent example of a new recruit who left the company shortly after starting the role because it took nearly a year to get specialist equipment in place so they could fully carry out the job.</p>\n    <p>\"We want to provide an inclusive environment, but without timely Access to Work funding for colleagues with complex disabilities, they are potentially being excluded,\" Diana said.</p>\n    <p>Diana has herself used Access to Work in a previous job. The money paid for travel costs to visit her team in different locations, which she otherwise wouldn't have been able to do, but said she sees the value in the programme.</p>\n    <p>\"It would be much more difficult for us to attract, recruit and to retain employees with disabilities [without the scheme],\" she said.</p>\n    <p>In a statement the DWP said: \"We inherited an Access to Work scheme that is failing both employees and employers, which is why - as part of our welfare reform - we consulted on how it could be improved.</p>\n    <p>\"We are reviewing all aspects of the scheme and will develop future policy with disabled people and the organisations that represent them.\"</p>\n    <p>It added there had been \"no change in Access to Work policy\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyl90ry2j7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And they often are also subject to a cap and limited in what purchases they apply to. The Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is perfect for someone that wants an easy-to-use card that still offers high rewards: you’ll earn a best-in-class flat rewards right away on your purchases -- with no limits or hoops to jump through.</p>\n    <p><strong>$200 cash rewards welcome offer</strong> -- New Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card holders can earn a $200 cash rewards welcome offer for spending just $500 in purchases in the first 3 months. Not only is this a very competitive sign-up bonus for a card with no annual fee, but it's also one of the things that sets this Wells Fargo credit card apart from other 2% back cards. We’ve yet to come across another credit card with 2% unlimited cash rewards that also has a sign-up bonus.</p>\n    <p><strong>12 months from account opening 0% APR intro offer </strong>-- New cardholders can enjoy 0% intro APR on both new purchases and eligible balance transfers for a full 12 months from account opening. (After that period, a go-to rate of 19.24%, 24.24%, or 29.24% Variable APR applies.) That's a great offer, even when compared to cards marketed just for a 0% intro APR. It means that this card will allow you to avoid interest on purchases and balance transfers for a full year!</p>\n    <p>Keep in mind that balance transfers need to be made within the first 120 days to qualify for a reduced interest rate and a lower balance transfer fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>No annual fee </strong>-- In many cases, high rewards rates mean high annual fees. Not with the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, which sports a $0 annual fee.</p>\n    <p><strong>Cell phone protection</strong> -- With the price of a typical cell phone in the hundreds of dollars, having some sort of insurance is a good idea. With this Wells Fargo card, you can get built-in cell phone protection of up to $600 just by paying your cell phone bill with your card. Coverage is subject to a $25 deductible.</p>\n    <p>Approval for the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card is most likely for applicants with good credit, which typically means a credit score of 670 or higher.

This site does not include all companies or products available in the marketplace.</p>\n    <p>Our editors rate credit cards objectively based on the features the credit card offers consumers, the fees and interest rates, and how a credit card compares with other cards in its category.

He added that the roommate was the defendant's romantic partner.</p>\n    <p>According to Mr Gray, the note said: \"I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.\"</p>\n    <p>The prosecutor also shared text messages between the roommates, including one in which the defendant allegedly said he shot Kirk because he had \"had enough of his hatred\".</p>\n    <p>The suspect is being held without bail in a special housing unit at the Utah County Jail. He made his first court appearance on Tuesday, appearing remotely as prosecutors read the seven charges against him.</p>\n    <p>The charges are aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering, and committing a violent crime when children are present.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/31cf/live/c6421a50-936b-11f0-8aaf-e3cc8432d68c.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A makeshift memorial has been set up outside the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, where a mother and her two children place flowers before a large poster of Charlie Kirk.\"/>\n    <p>They also said they would seek the death penalty over the shooting of Kirk, who was killed by a single gunshot fired from a rooftop as he was speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>Arrested last week after a 33-hour manhunt, the defendant has not entered a plea or confessed to police. The prosecutor also stressed that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and will face trial by jury.</p>\n    <p>He unveiled a trove of evidence at a news conference on Tuesday, including the defendant's alleged confession and DNA found on the trigger of the rifle suspected to have been used in the crime.</p>\n    <h2>An alleged hidden confession</h2>\n    <p>Describing the alleged hidden note at a news conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Gray said the defendant had sent a text message to his roommate reading: \"Drop what you're doing, look under my keyboard.\"</p>\n    <p>After reading the apparent confession, the roommate, who has not been named and is co-operating with investigators, replied: \"What??????????????

Authorities have said the roommate is transgender and transitioning from male to female.</p>\n    <p>In one exchange, the roommate asked the defendant why he had killed Kirk.</p>\n    <p>\"'I had enough of his hatred,'\" Mr Gray cited the messages as saying. \"'Some hate can't be negotiated out.'\"</p>\n    <p>The defendant also allegedly wrote: \"To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.\"</p>\n    <p>The roommate replied: \"you weren't the one who did it right????\"</p>\n    <p>The defendant replied: \"I am, I'm sorry.\"</p>\n    <h2>Suspect's parents confronted him</h2>\n    <p>Mr Gray also gave more detail about how the defendant's parents became suspicious that their son may have been involved in Charlie Kirk's killing.</p>\n    <p>He said the mother had seen a video of the suspect released a day after the shooting and told her husband it looked like their son. She confronted the son over the phone about the resemblance, Mr Gray said, but he told her he had been home sick on the day of the shooting.</p>\n    <p>The father later confronted the defendant, who responded by implying he might take his own life, the prosecutor said.</p>\n    <p>The suspect was eventually persuaded to come to his parents' house and while there, allegedly hinted he was the attacker. He then said he wanted to \"end it\" rather than go to jail, Mr Gray said.</p>\n    <p>With the help of a family friend, who is a retired deputy sheriff, his parents convinced him to surrender to police and he was arrested late on Thursday - 33 hours after the shooting.</p>\n    <p>The suspect also allegedly told his parents that \"there is too much evil and the guy spreads too much hate\", in a reference to Kirk, according to the indictment.</p>\n    <p>The mother told investigators her son had become more political in recent years, Mr Gray said, becoming more supportive of gay and transgender rights and entering a relationship with a transgender person.</p>\n    <p>But the prosecutor declined to answer when asked if Kirk had been targeted for his transgender views. \"That is for a jury to decide,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Mr Gray said the conservative influencer was answering a question about mass shootings carried out by transgender individuals when the gunshot rang out. The bullet struck Kirk in the neck and he immediately slumped to the ground.</p>\n    <p>The shot passed close to other people, including children and the person who asked Kirk the question, said the prosecutor.</p>\n    <h2>DNA on the rifle trigger</h2>\n    <p>Mr Gray said the suspect's DNA had been found on the trigger of the rifle used in the shooting.</p>\n    <p>He also said the suspect's father had suspected the weapon matched a bolt-action rifle that had once belonged to the suspect's grandfather. He contacted the suspect after the shooting and asked him to send a photo of the rifle, but he did not reply, Mr Gray said.</p>\n    <p>The defendant also detailed his movements after the shooting in messages sent to his roommate.</p>\n    <p>\"I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down,\" he wrote, according to prosecutors.</p>\n    <p>\"Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it,\" another message allegedly read.</p>\n    <p>\"I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it.\"</p>\n    <p>The defendant is also charged with witness tampering, prosecutors said, because he directed his partner to delete their messages and stay silent if questioned.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2r8lvjn2o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I can't finance next year and I can't cover the cost of food and drink,\" Mr Haddad told the BBC.</p>\n    <p>With two teenage daughters to feed, he is now borrowing money from relatives to survive.</p>\n    <p>Mr Haddad's struggle is echoed across Syria, where the worst drought in 36 years has slashed wheat harvests by 40% and is pushing a country - where nearly 90% of the population already lives in poverty - to the brink of a wider food crisis.</p>\n    <p>A report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates Syria will face a wheat shortfall of 2.73m tonnes this year, the equivalent of annual dietary needs for 16.25 million people.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2e52/live/42ad0000-8eee-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Maher Haddad Maher Haddad\"/>\n    <p>Without more food aid or the ability to import wheat, Syria's hunger crisis is set to worsen dramatically, warned Piro Tomaso Perri, FAO's senior programme officer for Syria.</p>\n    <p>\"Food insecurity could reach unprecedented levels by late 2025 into mid-2026,\" he said, noting that more than 14 million Syrians - six in 10 people - are already struggling to eat enough. Of those, 9.1 million face acute hunger, including 1.3 million in severe conditions, while 5.5 million risk sliding into crisis without urgent intervention.</p>\n    <p>The same report showed rainfall has dropped by nearly 70%, crippling 75% of Syria's rain-fed farmland.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the difference between families being able to stay in their communities or being forced to migrate,\" Mr Perri said. \"For urban households, it means rising bread prices. For rural families, it means the collapse of their livelihoods.\"</p>\n    <p>Farming families are already selling livestock to supplement lost incomes from wheat, reducing their number of daily meals, and there has been a rise in malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women.</p>\n    <p>Yet, the implications of the drought stretch far beyond the thousands of kilometres of barren farmlands.</p>\n    <p>Wheat is a staple crop in Syria. It is the main ingredient for bread and pasta - two food staples that should be low cost foods to families. So with the lack of wheat supply, the cost goes up.</p>\n    <p>For 39-year-old widow Sanaa Mahamid, affording bread has become a massive struggle.</p>\n    <p>With six children between the ages of nine and 20, she relies on the wages of two sons, but their salaries are not enough to cover the family's basic expenses.</p>\n    <p>\"Sometimes we borrow money just to buy bread,\" she said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/64e1/live/ff3a3210-8eee-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"EPA A truck is loaded with wheat from a Russian-flagged ship in the port of Tartous, Syria\"/>\n    <p>Last year, a bag of bread cost Sanna 500 Syrian pounds ($4.1; £3; €3.5), but now it is 4,500 Syrian pounds. To feed her family, Sanaa needs two bags a day - an expense of 9,000 pounds, before accounting for any other food.</p>\n    <p>\"This is too much. This is just bread, and we still need other things,\" she said. \"If the price of bread rises again, this will be a big problem. The most important thing is bread.\"</p>\n    <p>The crisis is a challenge for interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, as his administration works to rebuild Syria in the aftermath of the 14-year conflict and the removal of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.</p>\n    <p>International agencies, like the UN World Food Programme (WFP), are rushing to step in alongside the government to provide bread subsidies for those at risk of facing severe food insecurity.</p>\n    <p>But aid officials warn that subsidies are only a temporary fix, and that the long-term stability of Syria depends on whether farmers can stay on their land and sustain production.</p>\n    <p>\"We're trying to keep people in the farming game,\" Marianne Ward, the WFP's country director for Syria, said. She has worked to give $8m (£6m; €6.9m) in direct payments to small farmers - about 150,000 people - who lost all of their crops.</p>\n    <p>\"If you're not going to make money, you're going to leave the land. And then you're not going to have people who are going to be working in the agriculture sector which is essential for the economy,\" she said</p>\n    <p>But after more than a decade of war, Syria's agricultural sector was already battered by economic collapse, destroyed irrigation systems, and mined fields.</p>\n    <p>Dr Ali Aloush, the agriculture director for the Deir al-Zour region, Syria's breadbasket, said wheat fields needed to be irrigated four to six times per season, but that due to lack of rain, most farmers could not keep up.</p>\n    <p>\"The farmer's primary concern is first securing water and water requires fuel. The fuel price skyrocketed. It reached to 11,000 to 12,000 Syrian pounds per litre,\" Dr Aloush said.</p>\n    <p>The high price of fuel and power cuts meant water pumps were out of reach, and many growers were already burdened with debt.</p>\n    <p>Dr Aloush says a priority for his department and the transitional government in Damascus is putting money into irrigation projects - like solar powered drips - that will make water more accessible to farmers.</p>\n    <p>But projects like that take time and money - luxuries wheat farmers do not currently have.</p>\n    <p>So for millions of Syrians across the country, there is only one thing to do in the coming months: pray for rain.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Additional reporting by Lana Antaki in Damascus</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70x500lkdno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

John joined David to talk about how Donald Trump is using immigration to try to build support in the suburbs, if abortion on the ballot will lead to ticket splitting, Washington’s disconnect from the rest of the country, and where the 2024 election stands today. (For more from All Over the Map, click here.)</p>\n          <p>Oct 17, 2024</p>\n               \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/axe-files/episodes/d2b2228e-9f76-11ee-84b4-0bba31e697e0\">Ep. 597 — Ilana Dayan</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/axe-files\">The Axe Files with David Axelrod</a></p><p>Ilana Dayan, a prominent Israeli journalist, spoke with David last fall, just days after the October 7 massacre in Israel perpetrated by Hamas.

Annoyances like cramped leg room, high gas prices and mysterious service fees can make getting from point A to point B, a real pain. Is there a more efficient way to drive, board a plane or even fuel your vehicle? Harry turns to some very smart people who are doing their best to optimize the way we travel.

So, why are we so drawn to them? And it’s not just about sports and politics. It’s the human experience. Harry talks to his dear friend Neil Paine of FiveThirtyEight, underdog expert Nadav Goldschmied, and CNN's very own Coy Wire. As a former Buffalo Bills player, Coy knows a thing or two about being underestimated.

Sherlock Harry is on the case and he even attends a Bridgerton Ball to investigate.</p>\n          <p>Jun 14, 2022</p>\n               \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/margins-of-error/episodes/10ccb8f3-792b-497a-a96d-aea900e14646\">Why Americans Won’t Give an Inch on Metric</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/margins-of-error\">Margins of Error</a></p><p>Harry goes the extra “yard” to find out why the United States is one of the few countries that hasn’t gone metric.

Should we move heaven and earth to earn six figures, or can we be just as happy with less? Harry gets some answers from Matt Killingsworth, who created an app to track happiness in real time.

So where did the stereotypes come from, and is there a chance that people who wear glasses are smarter than those who don’t?

This is a helpful perk if you plan on buying anything with the card.<strong>Choose your payment due date:</strong> A little flexibility can go a long way when it comes to managing your finances. The card lets you choose from any available payment date, whether it's in the beginning, middle, or end of the month. That way, you can set up automatic payments that are aligned with your paycheck.<strong>No late fees:</strong> One of the most unique perks is that there are no late fees, ever. While you should always pay your bill on time, because late payments can still affect your credit, it's nice to know that you won't be charged if you do slip up and miss a payment.<strong>No penalty APR:</strong> If you miss some payments, most credit cards will increase your interest rate to their penalty APR. The Citi Simplicity® Card never charges a penalty rate, so your APR isn't at risk of increasing due to late payments.<strong>No annual fee:</strong> This card comes with no annual fee, which is an important feature if your goal is to pay off debt.</p>\n    <p>With the quality benefits the card offers, it's primarily aimed at consumers who have a credit score of 670 or better. There are reports of people with scores in the mid 600s being approved for this card.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Just what has Stephen Doughty done to upset <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a>? Are there no limits to the prime minister’s contempt and hatred? Not that Steve is a total nobody. He’s not a run-of-the-mill backbencher. But he has risen as high as he is likely to go as a junior minister in the Foreign Office. Probably higher than Steve ever expected. Certainly higher than his mates expected. Put simply, Steve is a dependable plodder. Someone who can be trusted to do as he is told. To not ask questions. And yet for Keir he is just collateral damage. Expendable.</p>\n    <p>Not that this is how it will have been put to Steve. Rather, the prime minister’s outriders will have taken him to one side. A word in your ear. We’ve got a top-secret mission for you. Get this right and we can win the war. The future of the country is in your hands. The generals probably said much the same to the infantrymen on the morning of the Somme offensive. Though Steve would die many times over. The walking dead.</p>\n    <p>On Thursday it was Doughty who was sent out to fend off the hospital pass of replying for the government on behalf of an urgent question on the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-mandelson\">Peter Mandelson</a> as US ambassador. And even though Steve got to break the news that Mandy had just been sacked, he still got a thorough kicking from opposition MPs. The bruises are still visible.</p>\n    <p>So you’d have thought that someone might have taken pity on poor Steve. Realised he was suffering from PTSD and could do with a spot of convalescence. Hell, even the worst offenders get a break sometime. But not Steve. The theory goes that he’s been so badly beaten up it won’t matter if he gets another mauling. Better to have just the one minister in intensive care.</p>\n    <p>And it’s not just the prime minister who has it in for Steve. Yvette Cooper also takes a very relaxed view of the health and wellbeing of her team. In theory, it could have been the foreign secretary who took both Thursday’s UQ and Tuesday’s emergency debate on Mandy. A chance for Yvette to lead from the front. Yet she, too, chose to go missing in action. Contenting herself with sending a letter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/peter-mandelson-us-ambassador-vetting-foreign-office\">exonerating the Foreign Office</a> of any blame in Mandelson’s appointment. Nothing to do with her, guv.</p>\n    <p>Still, at least the cowardice was catching. The Tories used to do the same whenever a cabinet minister was in trouble. Sending out some junior to face the flak while they hid in comfort several miles away behind the lines. Kemi Badenoch would later try to claim she would have set a different example. Luckily that will never be put to the test. So we were left with the hapless Steve looking miserable for three hours while everyone stuck pins in him. Some Tories would express regret. Steve was a decent man. They said. Yet still they killed him with kindness.</p>\n    <p>First we were treated to a 30-minute exposition of all Mandy’s many failings from Tory David Davis. It wasn’t just that he had been best pals with a convicted child sex offender. That was just a career highlight. There was also his double resignation as a cabinet minister. Once for failing to disclose a loan, the other for interfering in a passport application for an acquaintance. Then there was the fawning to the Russians and the Chinese. Mandy never met a billionaire over whom he could not swoon. Weirdly, for a self-professed master of the dark arts, Mandy has always been rubbish at self-preservation. He just can’t help himself.</p>\n    <p>We also had to endure 10 minutes of Kemi. What did the prime minister know and when, she asked. She is under the impression that it was her performance at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday that put the spotlight on Keir’s judgment. The reality was that it was the media who had done all the investigation on this.</p>\n    <p>And Kemi – along with every other Tory MP – had all the evidence that Mandelson was a wrong’un all along. They just hadn’t done anything about it. Everyone had said: “So what if Mandy had stayed with a sex offender? It’s Donald Trump we’re dealing with here so normal rules don’t apply.” Hypocrisy is never too far distant from a Westminster scandal.</p>\n    <p>Normally on days like this you can rely on a few government stooges to offer a few supportive words to the minister. Today, not so much. Most of the bare handful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> MPs who were in the house were there to stick it to Mandelson. They were from the left of the party and have never forgiven Tony Blair and Mandy for their manifold sins of 20 years ago.</p>\n    <p>A lone Labour whip handed out a list of topics helpful to Steve. Only two took up the offer. Florence Eshalomi wittered on about having been to Nigeria and seen the civil service doing good works there. She quickly petered out. Then we got uber-loyalist John Slinger. He talked of Andy Coulson and how David Cameron hadn’t vetted him properly. Quite quickly, he got laughed down by the whole house. Tory Julian Lewis called Mandy “Grovelling Lord Yum Yum” and Slinger was left sobbing. “Don’t patronise me,” he sobbed. What else was anyone meant to do with him?</p>\n    <p>And so to Steve. The last man standing. The prime minister had acted decisively, he insisted. Really? When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/keir-starmer-id-never-have-appointed-mandelson-if-id-known-what-i-know-now\">Keir had got the new information</a> that Mandelson had written to Epstein saying he had been wrongly convicted, he had sacked him. So let’s get this straight. It was fine with everyone – the Tories included – for Mandy to hang out with a sex offender as long as he thought he was guilty. Run that one past us again.</p>\n    <p>Doughty’s misery was almost complete. Mandy hadn’t been so bad. He had been a Times Radio presenter. Passed the vetting for Oxford chancellor. So why not be the US ambassador. Even Steve could tell that he was dying on his feet. Yet trying to kid himself he was doing something heroic. For Keir and country.</p>\n    <p>We never did get to the bottom of how the vetting process had been conducted and whether its findings had been ignored. Or whether Mandy might have lied. Shock horror. Steve rushed for the exits. A bottle of scotch was called for. Oblivion was the only answer.</p>\n    <p>The Bonfire of the Insanities by John Crace (Guardian Faber Publishing, £16.99).

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Quick update on Keir Starmer’s government of “national renewal”: having just lost his deputy and housing secretary over her failure to pay the required stamp duty, the prime minister has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations\">lost his US ambassador</a> over his known close association with a known paedophile sex trafficker. Hang on – he’s now also lost his director of political strategy for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/senior-starmer-adviser-paul-ovenden-quits-over-offensive-diane-abbott-messages\">relating some dirty jokes</a> about Diane Abbott.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, an increasing number of people think the solution to all this is Andy Burnham taking over, suggesting the current Greater Manchester mayor could run in a parliamentary seat that has only notionally become free because the previous Labour MP was suspended from the party after being found to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/10/labour-was-told-about-vile-whatsapp-group-more-than-a-year-ago-says-ex-councillor\">sent messages</a> hoping a couple of constituents would soon be dead/“mown down”, and is now apparently “<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DLVgxUGIodU/\">off sick</a>”. On top of which, we’re having the Americans round. US president Donald Trump touches down in the UK tonight on the eve of the most hideously ill-starred dinner party since the vomiting scene in Triangle of Sadness. I don’t think the nation could possibly feel any more renewed.</p>\n    <p>It’s been a few days since Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein were held up in front of the public using the hazmat tongs, and the more I’ve thought about them, the more I come back to one of the more obscure lines. Writing in apparent anguish on the eve of Epstein’s incarceration in 2008, Mandelson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/peter-mandelson-messages-jeffrey-epstein-disturbing-and-sickening-says-minister\">opines to him</a>: “It just could not happen in Britain.” Maybe he was right, unwittingly or otherwise. Britain is very, very good at a sort of institutionalised looking away. Maybe Mandelson was – unwittingly or otherwise – characterising something grim about this country that pious old Keir Starmer would no doubt be hugely affronted to be caught up in. Except, the prime minister <i>is</i> caught up in it – in fact, he’s at the very centre of it. He is the one who looked away.</p>\n    <p>It’s hard not to feel there is something necrotic and beaten about a government whose leader would appoint someone he knew had been very close to Epstein, who the entire world by that point knew was – and forgive me for repeating the words – a paedophile sex trafficker. Association with him was already known to be such a horror show that the late Queen Elizabeth II had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/chucked-under-royal-bus-prince-andrews-demotion-shows-institutions-ruthlessness\">sack her own son</a> for it. And there is something worse about Starmer’s horrifying lack of curiosity even as the facts closed in, right till the bitter end, with No 10 dithering for staggeringly long last week over a set of quite the most disqualifying emails, while Starmer fannied about defending Mandelson at the dispatch box.</p>\n    <p>This was, of course, the other dispatch box to the one at which Sir Keir plied his holier-than-thou trade in opposition. There’s an old online rule that declares that if you tell someone off for their spelling or grammar, you will always end up making your own howler while you’re doing it. Starmer spent his years in opposition telling off the Tories at every turn, instead of – for instance – coming up with a creative and coherent plan for growth. Inevitably, we now seem to be strapped in to watching him and his administration warrant a daily telling-off, as offences and immoralities mount up. Why does this keep happening to him, etc?</p>\n    <p>As for Epstein, we know that at the time Mandelson was writing to him telling him to fight for early release, police in Palm Beach, Florida had identified 36 girls<strong> </strong>who the “financier” had sexually abused. Yet for all the many years of grim and grotesque revelations, it still feels as though we know remarkably little about him. Who was he, this mysterious paedo Gatsby, and where did all his money come from?</p>\n    <p>Shortly after his death, New York magazine <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/hedge-funders-have-some-thoughts-on-what-epstein-was-doing.html\">ran a fascinating story</a> in which real hedge-funders expressed pointed bemusement over how Epstein made his money, since none of them had really had any dealings with him. As one big hedge-fund president, Doug Kass, put it: “I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested. Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.” As Kass had said to a journalist: “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” Or as another hedgie remarked: “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” And yet Epstein had made no noise at all in the financial world. They could barely find one investor. Their general theory was that the “hedge fund” was simply a cover for a blackmail scheme.</p>\n    <p>Perhaps most amazing, really, is the fact that Epstein will be a ghost at the feast tomorrow night for more than one attender, as Trump continues to butch out his long and close association with precisely the type of evildoer his Maga followers are convinced runs the world. Epstein is a guy who really does fit the very template of their darkest conspiracy theories – rich and powerful, involved in the trafficking of minors, connected in a network of some of the most powerful people in the world. This is all the sort of stuff they’ve been going on about for years – yet who should keep rearing his head in the story, but their own beloved president.</p>\n    <p>Isn’t it intriguing how many of them (currently) just can’t bring themselves to believe it? Something to discuss over the starter tomorrow night at Windsor Castle, perhaps, as long as everyone can keep their food down.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The year is 2125 and an AI-powered hologram of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a> is CEO of The World, Inc. Nation states are defunct and “citizens” an outdated concept. Now people function more like non-voting shareholders of heavily armed corporations. Anyone who dares to criticise Lord Musk is sentenced to death in a burning Tesla.</p>\n    <p>This isn’t my poor attempt at science fiction (apart from some creative licence around the AI Musk and Tesla executions). Rather, it’s a simplified approximation of the world Curtis Yarvin, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/magazine/curtis-yarvin-interview.html\">Silicon Valley’s favourite thinker</a>, wants to usher in. Yarvin, whose “dark enlightenment” ideas have influenced the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/30/curtis-yarvins-ideas-00201552\">Trump administration</a> and political kingmakers <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2022/05/the-strange-and-terrifying-ideas-of-neoreactionaries\">such as Peter Thiel</a>, believes super-rich elites should have dictatorial powers; universities and the press shouldn’t hold any sway; and the hoi polloi should suck it all up.</p>\n    <p>Musk is not a straightforward disciple of Yarvin, but both believe governments should be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-trumps-reign-fits-curtis-yarvins-blueprint-of-a-ceo-led-american-monarchy-what-is-technological-fascism-256202\">treated as corporations</a> and share disdain for liberal democracy and “woke” institutions. Both also have a raze-and-rebuild approach to the world. Indeed, long before Musk launched his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Yarvin devised <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/08/curtis-yarvin-doge-musk-thiel/\">Rage</a>, a plan to “retire all government employees”. Yarvin, by the way, wasn’t impressed with Doge (he compared it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner) because it didn’t grab enough power.</p>\n    <p>I bring all this up because, as Musk vies for a larger role on the world stage, it’s imperative we’re clear about what he’s trying to achieve. The billionaire, who spent <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/elon-musk-2024-election-spending-millions\">more than $290m</a> (£210m) influencing the US election, is increasingly taking his political meddling worldwide: he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/canada-election-elon-musk-justin-trudeau\">inserted himself into Canadian politics</a> earlier this year and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/08/elon-musk-afd-germany-mainstream-far-right\">helped boost</a> Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk spent January posting about grooming gangs in the UK and turned his attention back to the country over the weekend, appearing via video at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">far-right rally</a> in London. Musk called for a “change of government” and said: “Violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” A man who was born in South Africa but emigrated to the US <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/canada-musk-petition-revoke-citizenship-00205964\">by way of Canada</a> wants Britons to be terrified of foreigners.</p>\n    <p>So what’s the end goal here? Is Musk being guided by a Yarvinesque ideology or is this just what happens when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/elon-musk-trump-drug-use\">industrial amounts of ketamine</a> the billionaire is reported to have consumed interact with the world’s largest ego?</p>\n    <p>While a God complex may be at play, a politics of chaos appears to be Musk’s short-term goal. It feels increasingly as if the tech mogul is trying to stoke civil unrest and destabilise democracies worldwide so he can accumulate more power. In his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">new year address</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/elon-musk-wants-weak-europe-says-germanys-vice-chancellor-2024-12-30/\">Robert Habeck</a>, Germany’s vice-chancellor at the time, came to a similar conclusion, calling Musk’s support for the AfD a “logical and systematic” play to weaken Europe. “A weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power,” Habeck said.</p>\n    <p>Keir Starmer’s weaknesses – his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/09/how-keir-starmers-polling-became-one-of-the-worst-in-the-west-in-charts\">approval rating</a> is dismal – certainly seem to have captured Musk’s interest. Musk may not have an ideology as developed as Yarvin’s, but it does feel as if he’s attempting to become de facto CEO of the world, with deputies around the globe. It’s not inconceivable that Musk could effect regime change in Britain. And I’m not sure the government is taking this threat seriously enough. At a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-palestine-action-the-ban-on-gaza-activists-must-be-overturned\">pensioners are being arrested</a> for waving “Palestine Action” placards, the response to Musk’s calls for people to “fight back or … die” at a protest where 26 police officers were injured could have been somewhat more forceful. Starmer should impose sanctions on Musk, not just wag his finger at him.</p>\n    <p>What’s really at issue here, however, is the system that produced Musk and enabled his meddling. A healthy democracy should have safeguards in place that ensure a handful of super-rich individuals can’t usurp the political process. Those safeguards were removed from the US in 2010 with the supreme court’s <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained\">Citizens United ruling</a>, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and in effect allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Britain has nowhere near the amount of money sloshing through its politics as the US does, but an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/30/uk-political-donations-dark-money\">analysis last</a> year found dark money is rife: almost £1 in every £10 donated to British parties and politicians came from unknown or dubious sources.</p>\n    <p>Musk is odious, but he is right that Britain is under threat: if we don’t fight to conserve democracy, it will die. However, the foreigners we should worry about are not desperate people on small boats, they’re billionaires with rocket ships.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/british-democracy-under-threat-elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

What did he do?</p>\n    <p>Ovenden, who served as the director of strategy in Downing Street, stepped down after admitting to discussing Britain’s first Black woman MP, Diane Abbott, now 71, in derogatory sexual terms with party colleagues in 2017. In one message, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/starmer-aides-exit-over-lewd-abbott-jokes-deepens-crisis-as-trump-arrives\">he described</a> a “shag, marry, kill” game where he and two others had discussed Abbott and a colleague “using a strap-on” during sex and the prospect of “going down on” the MP.</p>\n    <p>And today, as yesterday, when the revelations surfaced, commentators from within the Westminster bubble are lamenting Ovenden’s loss to the government, with some appearing to dismiss the appalling messages and the backlash as a “<a href=\"https://x.com/MrHarryCole/status/1967594254232166470\">factional hit job</a>”. Poor old Paul Ovenden – and sod Abbott, then? It’s noteworthy, though perhaps predictable, that the political reaction is a circling of the Westminster wagons, and a general lack of regard for the Black person about whom the nasty comments were made.</p>\n    <p>And it speaks to something wider. The comments about Abbott, relayed and endorsed by Ovenden, are not just foul: they also reflect the way in which Black women are routinely dehumanised in this society, and the fact that when that happens, there is little protection. What’s even more striking about the row today is that remarks of this kind are not new, not private and not inconsequential.</p>\n    <p>There were deeply offensive remarks about Abbott and other women in a leaked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> report from five years ago, which exposed a toxic environment of bullying, racism and misogyny – yet instead of launching a cleanup, Labour pretty much brushed it all aside. Behaviour that would have been unacceptable in any other professional workplace was effectively normalised.</p>\n    <p>So when a spokesperson for Downing Street called the messages sent by Ovendon “appalling and unacceptable” in a statement to the press, it just didn’t wash. Labour’s leadership have long known this kind of thing is a problem. In marked contrast, Abbott has been suspended from the party twice over comments about race, having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/17/labour-suspends-diane-abbott-for-second-time-over-racism-comments\">deemed to be racist</a> despite the MP’s track record of supporting minoritised groups, including Jewish communities, while Labour leaders claim to be taking a hard line against alleged discrimination.</p>\n    <p>When Martin Forde KC delivered an <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/resources/the-forde-report/\">independent review</a> in 2022, one the party itself commissioned, he confirmed the scale of Labour’s culture problem and offered a roadmap for reform. Rather than taking his findings seriously, the party dismissed them – and, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-racism-report-martin-forde-starmer-b2564059.html\">as I exclusively reported</a>, even tried to gag Forde when he spoke out.</p>\n    <p>It suits a beleaguered No 10 and its supporters to characterise this as factional infighting, but that simple explanation doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. What has emerged this week, coupled with the Forde report, shows a pattern of toxicity that transcends factional battles. It points to something deeper: a culture in which misogyny and misogynoir, or hostility towards Black women, could flourish unchecked.</p>\n    <p>Ovenden’s resignation comes at a febrile moment for Labour, just days after Peter Mandelson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/keir-starmer-id-never-have-appointed-mandelson-if-id-known-what-i-know-now\">removed as ambassador to the US</a> and Angela Rayner stepped down as deputy prime minister. In Mandelson’s case, questions over his links to Jeffrey Epstein were already known, but action only followed once they became public. Therein lies a pattern. But this whole furore cannot be just another episode in a turbulent fortnight. It must be a test of whether Labour will finally confront racism in its own ranks or treat it as yet another crisis to be managed away.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, the party <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/race-equality-engagement-group\">launched its Race Equality Engagement group</a> (REEG), led by Doreen Lawrence, to help “ethnic minority communities, stakeholders and delivery partners to seize opportunities and remove barriers to racial equality across the UK and to hear people’s lived experiences.” Yet it will need to prove that equality is being prioritised in its own ranks. The scandal surrounding Ovenden’s resignation isn’t just about him or the fact that he’s gone – but that the party’s higher-ups knew about these kinds of abuses and looked the other way.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>There is a critical question here: if Labour cannot protect the country’s first Black woman MP from racist and sexist denigration within its own ranks, how seriously can it claim to champion equality outside them?</p>\n    <p>Another day in Labour’s bubble, and there will be more bad days. I’ve seen unredacted internal material. What’s already out is damning enough – but it is not the full story. Senior figures cannot plausibly claim they were unaware of the nature of this kind of misbehaviour.</p>\n    <p>Root-and-branch reform isn’t now optional; it’s the only way Labour can show that it values accountability over expediency, and that the abuse endured by Abbott and others will not be brushed aside again. The party is haemorrhaging supporters, not least from minority communities. If it cares about that, time is of the essence.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Nadine White is a journalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondent</p></li>\n      <li>\n  <strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>‘Humbug”, and “a half-baked scheme to be administered by an unknown court”. Nigel Farage or Robert Jenrick attacking the European convention on human rights (ECHR)? No – Herbert Morrison, leader of the Commons, and William Jowitt, lord chancellor in Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, respectively, both arguing that Britain should not accede to the convention.</p>\n    <p>Labour was suspicious, fearing that it would prevent nationalisation. It did not. Today, Conservatives and Reform UK fear that it will frustrate immigration control. It need not.</p>\n    <p>Denmark and Sweden have recently taken draconian measures to restrict immigration without falling foul of the ECHR. The Danish Social Democrats have reduced asylum claims to their lowest level for 40 years. In Sweden, a government of the right has seen a 23% <a href=\"https://ecre.org/aida-country-report-on-sweden-update-on-2024/#:~:text=Statistics,down%20from%20195%20in%202023).\">fall in asylum applications</a> between 2023 and 2024.</p>\n    <p>Admittedly, the ECHR as well as the UN’s 1951 refugee convention protect the rights of asylum seekers against deportation to countries where they might face ill-treatment. It would be inhumane to do otherwise. Would anyone wish to deport women to Afghanistan or dissidents to Iran?</p>\n    <p>Judicial interpretation of article 8 of the ECHR that requires respect for family life has made it difficult to repatriate criminals and illegal immigrants. But the government can tighten the immigration rules, providing principles intended to guide judicial interpretation, in particular that the public interest of immigration control overrides the private interest of an article 8 claimant, except in very exceptional circumstances. If European judges resist such guidance, that would incentivise EU leaders to press for ECHR reform. Nine, including Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Poland’s Donald Tusk, are <a href=\"https://www.governo.it/sites/governo.it/files/Lettera_aperta_22052025.pdf\">already doing so</a>.</p>\n    <p>In any case, the government, as former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has indicated, can derogate – that is suspend – article 8, while the refugee convention probably allows a temporary implied derogation when a country faces a mass influx.</p>\n    <p>The British government accepts that the ECHR, enacted well before the age of mass transit, needs reform. But it would be a grave mistake to leave the ECHR. It is rare, if not unprecedented, for a democracy to exit a major human rights regime. It would be particularly dangerous for Britain. For we have moved, since Brexit, from a system governed by a constitution – the EU treaties – to an unprotected one with no real checks to prevent a government from doing whatever it likes: a system characterised 50 years ago by Lord Hailsham, future Conservative lord chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/oct/15/guardianobituaries.conservatives\">as elective dictatorship</a>.</p>\n    <p>Some might object that our immemorial rights were perfectly well protected by parliament and the common law long before the ECHR. Perhaps in normal times; but not during a moral panic such as may exist today when the debate on immigration and asylum is in danger of succumbing to what Timothy Garton Ash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/12/fight-xenophobic-populists-need-free-speech\">has called</a> “inflammatory rhetoric”.</p>\n    <p>During a previous moral panic at the time of the 1974 IRA bombing campaign, Leslie Scarman, a prominent law lord, wrote, “When times are normal and fear is not stalking the land, English law sturdily protects the freedom of the individual ... But when times are abnormally alive with fear and prejudice, the common law cannot resist the will, however frightened and prejudiced it may be, of parliament.”</p>\n    <p>In 1968, Harold Wilson’s Labour government feared an influx of Kenyan Asians escaping Kenya’s Africanisation policy. Its Commonwealth Immigrants Act imposed retrospective immigration controls on “non-belonging” <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/29/racist-legislation-led-windrush-home-office\">people with British passports</a>. The bill, supported by opposition Conservatives, passed its various parliamentary stages in <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2018-0109/LLN-2018-0109.pdf\">just seven days</a>. In 1973, the European court of human rights found that this legislation had subjected Asian people in east Africa to “racial discrimination” amounting to “degrading treatment”. In 2002, as Labour home secretary, Blunkett ended a “historic wrong” by giving British citizenship to the 35,000 Asian people rendered stateless by the act.</p>\n    <p>There is an even more significant example from Northern Ireland. Under unionist rule from 1921 to 1972, there was what the Cameron commission in 1969 characterised as unfair allocation of council housing, discrimination in local government appointments and gerrymandering of local authority boundaries. Catholic grievances erupted in the 1968 civil rights movement. The Catholic plurality in the province, therefore, feels a symbolic attachment to the ECHR. To leave would arouse Catholic resentment and severely strain the Good Friday agreement.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>When the ECHR, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/oct/04/human-rights-act-conservatives\">spearheaded by Winston Churchill</a>, was enacted, it was primarily to prevent any resurgence of fascism or national socialism. Today, however, a main concern of the 1998 Human Rights Act, which gave effect in Britain to ECHR rights, is with the rights of minorities too small to be able to use the democratic machinery of party politics and pressure groups effectively. The act has become unpopular because some prominent cases brought under it have involved the rights of unpopular minorities such as asylum seekers, prisoners and suspected terrorists, rather than nice people such as ourselves. However, being nice is not a necessary qualification for enjoying human rights, and even nice people such as ourselves may on some future occasion need the protection of the act.</p>\n    <p>Britain is one of just three democracies without a codified constitution, the other two being New Zealand and Israel. So we are peculiarly susceptible to illiberal legislation. Leaving the ECHR would make our rights almost entirely the responsibility of our sovereign parliament. Are MPs and ministers really so much more sensitive to the protection of human rights than the legislators of democracies protected by constitutions that they can be safely entrusted with this important responsibility?</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Vernon Bogdanor is a professor of government at King’s College London.

The focus of this acclamation was not Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, the organiser of the so-called “free speech” march in central London last Saturday.</p>\n<p>They were instead shouting themselves hoarse for Charlie Kirk, the murdered political activist from Cook County in the US state of Illinois.</p>\n<p>It is unlikely that many of the 110,000 to 150,000 protesters estimated to have been on the streets last weekend, at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">what turned out to be the largest rally of its type in British history</a>,<strong> </strong>knew much about Kirk before his death at the hands of a gunman at Utah Valley University.</p>\n<p>The UK version of Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which claims to be the “largest Conservative student movement” in the US, has never really taken off in Britain.</p>\n<p>But they were moved to cheer him on Saturday. Clips of an almost entirely white and predominantly male crowd of Britons chanting the first name of the murdered 31-year-old were lapped up on social media accounts said to be US-based, as was the minute’s silence afterwards.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of British patriots just fell silent in honor of Charlie Kirk in London,” tweeted Eric Daugherty, an assistant news director at the conservative Florida’s Voice website (“Honest political reporting to Florida, minus the mainstream talking points.”)</p>\n<p>It is said that when America coughs, Britain catches a cold.</p>\n<p>The reality with this strain of politics is that there is something of a feedback loop between the US and the UK that is proving mutually beneficial to both sides, said Prof Paul Jackson, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pride-in-prejudice-9781526156723/\">Pride in Prejudice: Understanding Britain’s Extreme Right</a>.</p>\n<p>Kirk may not have been a household name in the UK but his murder offered validation for a view that a certain outlook on life is under threat. In turn, the scenes on Saturday provided evidence of the righteousness of the cause back in the US.</p>\n<p>There is history to this mutually enforcing exchange of ideas on the extreme right, said Jackson.</p>\n<p>A certain type of US political thought has never travelled well across the Atlantic, notably the Ku Klux Klan, which grew after the civil war in the late 1860s, said Jackson.</p>\n<p>But other ideas have thrived in the past as they do today, including those contained in Madison Grant’s 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, which influenced some European white supremacists, and Henry Ford’s The International Jew.</p>\n<p>It has not all been one way. The Blood &amp; Honour movement, founded by British neo-Nazi and white power music pioneer Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987, led to the birth of Blood &amp; Honour American Division and Blood &amp; Honour Council US.</p>\n<p>That was the analogue age, though.</p>\n<p>In the digital era, particularly in the so-called “counter-jihad” space that now dominates what is loosely termed the far right, the mutual reinforcement of messages is done in real time. Stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another.</p>\n<p>Kirk himself was one of those who picked up on the case of Lucy Connolly, the 42-year-old English woman –married to a Conservative councillor – who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for calling for hotels that were housing asylum seekers to be burned down during last summer’s riots.<strong> </strong>(She was released in August after serving less than half her sentence.)</p>\n<p>“Every day people say: ‘Well someone should go kill Charlie Kirk.’ I don’t like it, but that is protected speech,” he told GB News. “In America, we care what you do and not what you say.”</p>\n<p>It was of a piece with the general claim that free speech is under threat in the UK, confirmed in the mind of the likes of JD Vance by the UK’s Online Safety Act, aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content, which the US vice-president claims has put Britain on a “very dark path”.</p>\n<p>The amplification of certain causes, the repetition of choice phrases, cannot be said to be highly organised, but it is nonetheless powerful.</p>\n<p>The Infowars website, founded by the prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, promoted Robinson’s content about the rally on Saturday, but also that of a series of obscure accounts on X, said to be based in both the UK and the US.</p>\n<p>“Breaking: London falls silent for fallen hero Charlie Kirk,” said one such account with 335,700 followers that described itself as a defender of western values and culture. “The British media hated him. The British people certainly didn’t.”</p>\n<p>Another account promoted by Jones’s site was that of Naomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer linked to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, who is known for her climate change denial and promotion of “great replacement theory” tropes.</p>\n<p>She tweeted images from the rally to her 436,700 followers that included the words: “White children will grow up as patriots from now on. White guilt is over.”</p>\n<p>Brigitte Gabriel, founder of the anti-Muslim movement Act for America, which claims to have 1,000 local chapters across the US, posted on X: “Don’t let the media downplay how massive this is. Millions of patriots in the UK are standing up for free speech.”</p>\n<p>Then there is Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law\">who appeared via videolink at Saturday’s rally</a>. It would be difficult to overplay the importance to Robinson of the support of one of the world’s richest men, according to analysts including the Hope Not Hate anti-extremist organisation.</p>\n<p>In lifting the ban on Robinson’s content on X and through his own misleading posts framing him as a free speech warrior persecuted by the state, Musk gave the activist a vital leg-up, it is argued.</p>\n<p>Robinson, a former member of the racist British National party, who has a string of convictions to his name including for assault, using a fake passport, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, is said to have been able to build upon his profile in the US, stir up protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers while pushing anti-immigrant messages that circle around a supposed threat of Islamisation to the UK.</p>\n<p>“When you hear people talk about the special relationship between America and Great Britain, this is the special relationship that you’re seeing here,” Robinson said at the rally.</p>\n<p>“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd, in turn.</p>\n<p>Musk is not yet believed to have directly funded anyone in the UK, although he reportedly flirted with offering money to Reform, the rising political party on the right that is led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a>. But such transatlantic relationships do exist, albeit they tend to remain below the radar. It is a murky soup – but some of the chunkier players can be made out.</p>\n<p>One is the US tech billionaire Robert Shillman, known as Dr Bob, who in 2018 financed a fellowship that helped pay for Robinson to be employed by the rightwing Canadian media website, Rebel Media, now called Rebel News, on a salary of about £5,000 a month.</p>\n<p>Other Shillman fellows have included Katie Hopkins, the English former reality TV star who compared migrants to cockroaches, and Laura Loomer, the American conspiracy theorist referred to by some as the president’s “de facto national security adviser”.</p>\n<p>The rightwing Middle East Forum thinktank, led by the neoconservative academic Daniel Pipes, has paid for foreign speakers to attend Robinson rallies in the past, in addition to funding the activist’s legal defence.</p>\n<p>There are laws against foreign donations in both the US and the UK but the far-right echo chamber is also clearly a useful tool for those seeking electoral success on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>Trump has had no qualms about bouncing off certain British causes, sometimes unadvisedly. He said he was prepared to apologise in 2018 when he retweeted posts from Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP. But he is notably cautious about certain characters.</p>\n<p>Trump, who will be in the UK for a state visit this week, did not comment on social media about Saturday’s rally. He appears to prefer his outriders to do the work at times, including his son.</p>\n<p>When the rightwing activist Kurt Schlichter claimed – falsely – on X that Robinson had been arrested for reporting on a court case in May 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> Jr retweeted it, writing: “Reason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.”</p>\n<p>In the UK, Farage, who successfully fought for decades for the UK to leave the European Union and is today riding high in the polls with his anti-immigration populism, has sought to keep a sterile gap between himself and Robinson, who he fears is beyond the pale for much of the British public.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-london-transatlantic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

How ridiculous is that?” said Philip Adams.</p>\n    <p>Adams, who has lived in Ludlow for many years, remembers the bygone days of the poppy red buses of the Midland Red company toing and froing to Birmingham, until the publicly owned business was broken up in 1981 and sold off under Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation and privatisation agenda.</p>\n    <p>Today, Midland Red buses can only be found in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-59827695\">transport museums</a>, and the route from Ludlow to Birmingham is most often done by car.</p>\n    <p>Over the years since privatisation, bus companies in Shropshire have folded, risen and folded again, and the public service has collapsed.</p>\n    <p>According to data from the thinktank Common Wealth, the county has suffered one of the biggest reductions in bus routes in the UK over the past six years, with a 60% reduction in kilometres travelled by bus.</p>\n    <p>A survey of passenger experiences of Ludlow’s bus routes, conducted by the town’s sustainable transport group, revealed how people, particularly elderly residents, were suffering from this devastation of public transport.</p>\n    <p>Confusing timetabling, long gaps of up to four hours between buses, and irregular service were all highlighted. “The accessibility of a regular town bus has practically been destroyed,” said one member of the public.</p>\n    <p>According to Common Wealth’s research, the same picture is repeated across the country. Since privatisation, services have collapsed but bus and train ticket prices have risen above inflation every year since 1987.</p>\n    <p>More than £16bn has been paid in dividends to the owners of bus and train companies: £14.2bn since 1996 to the shareholders of the privatised train companies and £1.82bn for the shareholders of bus companies since 2007, according to Common Wealth.</p>\n    <p>Since 2020 alone, at least £143m has been distributed to the shareholders of bus firms while the companies oversaw pre-tax losses of £53m.</p>\n    <p>Taxpayers are shovelling money into the system to shore it up, with £2bn of additional public funding paid to bus operators in the past five years.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hm1Xo/1/\">Graphic shows bus fare rises compared with motoring costs</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Train companies are also receiving public money while handing out dividends. According to the Office of Road and Rail, the public paid £12.5bn in 2023-24 to subsidise rail companies – £4.1bn in net payments directly to operating companies and £8.3bn paid to Network Rail, which in turn further subsidises the operating companies indirectly.</p>\n    <p>Direct and indirect subsidies to train companies enabled the operating companies and the rolling stock companies to run post-tax profits of £449m annually since the year ending March 2017.</p>\n    <p>But much of these profits, Common Wealth says, were paid out in dividends rather than reinvested in services.</p>\n    <p>Today getting a train from Ludlow to Birmingham is almost as difficult as spotting a bus on the route. It requires a detour 30 miles north to Shrewsbury, or 24 miles south to Hereford, to change trains for the Birmingham service.</p>\n    <p>For passengers who use the CrossCountry trains from the south-west to Birmingham and beyond, the pain is evident. The company was ranked the worst in Britain this summer by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport\">Transport</a> Focus, the independent watchdog for passengers, and only 41% of its services run on time.</p>\n    <p>Ownership of the rail and bus sectors faces a shakeup by the Labour government. Train operating companies across the UK are being renationalised under the 2024 Passenger Railway Services Act, with Welsh and Scottish rail operators back in public ownership in 2021 and 2022 respectively.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/AXVi8/1/\">Chart shows distance travelled by buses has reduce in 15 English local authorities</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>But Mathew Lawrence, the director of Common Wealth, said the rolling stock companies also needed to be returned to public ownership to ensure renationalisation led to a coherent and well-planned system.</p>\n    <p>The bus sector is also facing an overhaul, with new legislation permitting the creation of local authority-owned bus companies once again and bringing fares, routes, timetables and connections back into public control.</p>\n    <p>Public ownership of public transport is overwhelmingly popular. In 2024, YouGov found that 76% of the electorate backed public ownership of rail and 66% backed public ownership of bus services.</p>\n    <p>“Passengers pay the price for privatisation through higher fares and cut-back services,” said Lawrence.</p>\n    <p>“Public transport should be genuinely public. Money should be reinvested, not leak out the system. Vital services should be provided based on need not profit. And the fragmentation that leads to higher costs should be replaced by a coherent, public-oriented system.”</p>\n    <p>As a member of Ludlow 21, a sustainable transport group in Shropshire, Adams agrees. “Privatisation has been a complete disaster for bus services. It just doesn’t work.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/16/there-are-no-buses-privatisation-dead-end-ludlow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In 1979, a 10-year-old Nick Lowles saw a hard-right party political broadcast. Born in Hounslow in London, he had moved to Shrewsbury when he was seven: “A very white town. There was a British Movement march soon after we moved up there.” Theirs was a “small-P political household”. His dad was a social worker, his mum worked for various charities. “She was from Mauritius, and now on the telly, the National Front were saying they were going to send people who weren’t born in Britain home in six months. I was petrified that my mum was going to get sent home.” The ambient racism of 70s and 80s Britain permeated everything. “I just remember being scared,” Lowles says. “We used to go on holiday and I tan really easily. I was frightened of coming back to school too brown.”</p>\n<p>You can’t meet terrifying politics except with politics of your own, he realised in his teens. How to Defeat the Far Right is Lowles’s memoir-cum-manual, telling the story of how Hope Not Hate, the anti-fascist campaign group, came into existence in 2004. There is no other organisation like it, in its range of actions and independence of spirit. It does a lot of data (polling and analysis) but also a lot of community organising; it infiltrates fascist spaces, online and off, to subvert their plans, and it organises counterprotests. It is connected to institutional politics, though its influence waxes and wanes – Lowles is a good friend of Gordon Brown’s, but doesn’t feel especially heeded by the current government.</p>\n<p>How to Defeat the Far Right is a troubling read. There are victories – in Barking and Dagenham, Hope Not Hate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/14/general-election-2010-fall-bnp\">campaigned to defeat the BNP</a> after it did so well in the 2006 local elections that, had it stood more candidates, it would have been the first council in Britain controlled by an openly racist party. Possibly less well known is Hope Not Hate’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/far-right-terror-plot-police-jack-renshaw-rosie-cooper-mp\">foiling of a plot</a> to murder the MP Rosie Cooper in 2017. Jack Renshaw, a member of the banned far-right organisation National Action, planned to kill Cooper with a gladius machete that he’d already bought, as well as take hostages, lure in a detective, preferably female, and kill her as well. Another member of Renshaw’s group was secretly passing all this information to Hope Not Hate, which enabled his arrest.</p>\n<p>And yet, the overall arc is not victorious. The far right is stronger than ever. Reading Lowles’s book, I felt like that picture of a cat reading To Kill a Mockingbird, thinking, “There is no information here about killing mockingbirds.” The Tommy Robinson march at the weekend, exactly as Lowles predicted, was “massive”. Police estimated there were between 110,000 and 150,000 people in central London, possibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted\">the largest far-right demonstration</a> the UK has ever seen. Even without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/13/elon-musk-calls-for-dissolution-of-parliament-at-far-right-rally-in-london\">Elon Musk’s video address</a>, with his chilling “fight or die” language, Lowles’s point was clear: “Violence and extreme violence are part of our politics in a way that’s only going to get worse.”</p>\n<p>Between our interview and that demo, the hard-right US activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead while he was speaking, and the reaction, Lowles says, “was so many people, in the US and the UK, saying ‘This is war’; ‘Time for revenge’. There are growing forces, principally on the far right but also other places, who are itching for conflict, who are itching for civil war as the only way to achieve their goals.” And it’s hard, if you were frightened in London on Saturday – whether because you were part of the 5,000-strong counterprotest, or because you were not white – to see how you sit that out.</p>\n<p>Lowles has quite an upbeat disposition but it’s not mindless – his perspective is more, “We are where we are, what are you going to do, lie down?” Speaking to me in the Guardian offices – a bare little room with no distinguishing features, so that all the atmosphere comes from the peril-ridden conversation – he says matter-of-factly: “People are really demoralised. People feel life is tough. In the migration sector, in the refugee sector, in the climate sector, people are feeling defeated. There’s a job of work to do for our own side, people who believe in a multicultural society: we need to feel like there’s a togetherness, because people feel quite alone.”</p>\n<p>Life changed for Lowles in the mid-80s, when at 15 he became political. He was into everything – the anti-apartheid movement, Trotskyite politics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/22/red-wedge-bringing-labour-party-politics-to-young-music-fans\">Red Wedge</a> (the musicians’ collective supporting Labour to oust Margaret Thatcher, which, well-spotted, took ages). He went to the University of Sheffield because his Trot group wanted a ringleader for a nascent anti-fascist group there, “and I found myself spending all my time going to other people’s meetings to argue with them. We’d be sent in, we’d have a little script, they’d come to our meetings to argue with us. That’s all we did all day – we didn’t speak to any ordinary people at all. But I was always an activist, I didn’t give a shit about the theory. I just suddenly thought, ‘What am I doing?’”</p>\n<p>“Activist” is quite a freighted word, nowadays. The line between activism and direct action appears more and more blurry, as public order offences are now <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crime-and-policing-bill-2025-factsheets/crime-and-policing-bill-public-order-factsheet\">so numerous</a> that it feels as if chanting “we shall overcome” carries a potential prison sentence, and it’s possible to pass on a bus through central London and see <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rvly00440o\">900 pensioners get arrested</a> for sitting on the grass with homemade Palestine Action signs. We have a quick and frankly mad conversation about what this government classes as terrorism. “At Hope Not Hate, we’ve been lobbying for years to ban a Nazi satanist group called Order of Nine Angles. It’s been in existence for 50 years, but over the last 15 years, with the internet, it has inspired a generation of mainly teenage boys to commit really bad acts of violence, both to themselves and to others, and particularly to women. People have been sent to prison in this country because they’ve encouraged teenage girls to self-harm; there’s an overlap with child pornography. It’s shocking. Those two sisters who were murdered in Wembley,” he says, referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/you-have-to-let-the-anger-go-mina-smallman-on-her-daughters-and-the-police-who-photographed-the-bodies\">Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman</a>. “The bloke behind it, he wasn’t a Nazi but he was a satanist, reading all this material. Every time we go to the Home Office, they say, ‘We don’t know whether it meets the threshold.’ And then they ban a group …” He trails off without mentioning that group, understandably. If he didn’t get arrested for saying it, I’d get arrested for writing it.</p>\n<p>Where does Lowles stand on direct action, and what it means? He makes an endearing groaning noise, like a man who’s just been asked whether he thinks the conservatory could do with a lick of paint. “When I first got involved in anti-fascism – this was late 80s – it was all about the street. I’m not saying it was right, but that’s how it was. You didn’t have cameras.” So, wait, he doesn’t mean handing out leaflets in the street? “No, you would have groups of Nazis and groups of anti-fascists, and they would battle it out, down sidestreets, and sometimes it got quite violent. I mean, look at me, I’m not built for that. I never got involved in that. But that was the world it was.”</p>\n<p>I<strong> </strong>actually do look at him, because this is a huge question. It’s not really about whether you are tall enough or brawny enough to fistfight. It’s about how directly you experience fascism, how personal it is to you, how urgent, but also how much else you would try before you’d give in to a primitive confrontation – the whole constellation that makes you look at a man throwing a brick, and pick up a brick of your own. And he’s right, he’s not built for it, but only for the last reason, not for the others.</p>\n<p>“So that’s why I gravitated towards Searchlight,” he says. This was an anti-fascist magazine that had been going since the 60s, with the lo-fi look of a fanzine but very carefully researched reporting. “I’d take photos. Gerry Gable, the head of Searchlight, said the best thing you can do – this was 1989 – is intelligence, find out what the fascists are up to. Within three weeks, we had one person in the Sheffield BNP, within three months we had three people in Yorkshire. So I felt I was doing something that wasn’t having to pick up a hammer and run around the streets, which other people were doing.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/16/basic-decency-british-people-hope-not-hate-nick-lowles-how-to-defeat-far-right\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A small monitor on the wall pulsed with the vitals of current patients, who filled the ER. An ambulance idled outside in the South Texas heat with a patient waiting for a bed to open up.</p>\n<p>\"Everybody shows up here,\" Margo said. \"When you're overwhelmed and you're overrun, there's only so much you can do.\"</p>\n<h3>Trump voters and a new Trump law</h3>\n<p>Starr County, a largely rural, Hispanic community on the southern U.S. border, <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/politics/article/texas-starr-county-19893663.php\">made headlines in 2024</a> when it voted Republican in a presidential election for the first time in more than a century. Immigration and the economy <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/01/texas-trump-republican-road-trip-00205851\">drove the flip</a> in this community, where roughly a third of the population falls below the poverty line.</p>\n<p>Now, recent actions by the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have triggered a new concern: the inability of doctors, hospitals and other health providers to continue to care for uninsured patients. It's a fear not only in Starr County, which has one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation. Communities across the U.S. with similarly high proportions of uninsured people could struggle as additional residents lose health coverage.</p>\n<p>About 14 million fewer Americans are expected to have health insurance in a decade due to President Trump's new tax-and-spending law, which Republicans dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, and the pending expiration of enhanced subsidies that slashed the price of Affordable Care Act plans for millions of people. The new law also <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/5-key-facts-about-medicaid-and-provider-taxes/\">limits programs</a> that send billions of dollars to help those who care for uninsured people stay afloat.</p>\n<h3>The safety net may fail</h3>\n<p>\"You can't disinsure this many people and not have, in many communities, just a collapse of the health care system,\" said Sara Rosenbaum, founding chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.</p>\n<p>\"The future is South Texas,\" she said.</p>\n<p>KFF Health News is examining the impact of national health care policy changes on uninsured people and their communities. Though the Trump administration told KFF Health News it is making \"a historic investment in rural health care,\" people who treat low-income patients, as well as researchers and consumer advocates, say recent policy decisions will make it harder for people to stay healthy. Doctors, hospitals, and clinics that make up the health care safety net could lose so much money they must close their doors, some of them warn.</p>\n<p>\"Because the patient's bill is not going to get paid,\" said Dr. Joseph Alpert, editor-in-chief of <i>The American Journal of Medicine</i> and a professor of medicine at the University of Arizona. \"Uninsured patients stress the health care system.\"</p>\n<p>Starr County shows how this dynamic unfolds. Primary care doctors in the county serve an average of <a href=\"https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/community-conditions/health-infrastructure/clinical-care/primary-care-physicians?year=2025&amp;county=48427\">just under 3,900 people</a> each, nearly three times the U.S. average.</p>\n<p>Margo, the family physician, said because so many people lack insurance and there are so few places to seek care, many residents treat the ER as their first stop when they're sick.</p>\n<p>In many cases, they have neglected their health, making them sicker and more expensive to treat. And <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act\">federal law</a> requires ERs at hospitals in the Medicare program to stabilize or transfer patients, regardless of their ability to pay.</p>\n<p>That leaves Margo and his team to practice what he described as \"disaster medicine.\"</p>\n<p>\"They come in with chest pain or they stop breathing. They collapse. They've never seen a doctor,\" Margo said. \"They're literally dying.\"</p>\n<h3>Health systems in 'survival mode'</h3>\n<p>When people are uninsured or on Medicaid, they tend to rely on a safety net of doctors, hospitals, clinics, and community health centers, which offer services free of charge or absorb getting reimbursed at lower rates than they do treating patients on commercial insurance.</p>\n<p>Those providers' financial situations can often be precarious, leading them to rely on myriad federal supports. The Trump administration's cuts to health care and Medicaid in the name of eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" has many concerned they won't weather the additional financial strain.</p>\n<p>Trump's new law funds his priorities, like extending tax cuts that mainly benefit wealthier Americans and expanding immigration enforcement. Those costs are covered in part by a nearly $1 trillion reduction in federal health spending for Medicaid within the next decade and changes to the ACA, such as requiring additional paperwork and shortening the time for people to sign up.</p>\n<p>Many Republicans have argued Medicaid has gotten too large and strayed from the state-federal program's core mission of covering those with low incomes and disabilities. And the GOP has fought to roll back the ACA since its passage.</p>\n<p>Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office about how many people could lose health insurance are an \"overestimate.\" He did not provide an estimate the administration sees as more accurate.</p>\n<p>Supporters of OBBBA say those who need health coverage can still get it if they meet new requirements such as working in exchange for Medicaid coverage.</p>\n<p>And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said even with the legislation, Medicaid spending will grow, just not as quickly.</p>\n<p>The budget law won't cause \"the sky to fall,\" Cannon said. \"The inefficient providers should be shutting down.\"</p>\n<h3>Layoffs starting, more anticipated</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amga.org/getmedia/3dc8569a-b9ba-4280-8657-1dc84d3cfafc/medicaid-cuts-survey_2025.pdf\">A recent survey</a> from AMGA, formerly the American Medical Group Association, which represents health systems across the country, found nearly half of rural facilities could close or restructure due to Medicaid cuts. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they anticipated layoffs or furloughs, including of front-line clinicians.</p>\n<p>\n                Maria Salgado, a community health worker, or <i>promotora</i>, for the nonprofit MHP Salud, meets with clients at a public library in Roma, Texas. One of her jobs is to sign people up for health coverage.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Sam Whitehead/KFF Health News\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>Public health departments, which often fill gaps in care, also face federal funding cuts that have reduced their capacity. In South Texas' Cameron County, the health department has eliminated nearly a dozen positions, said agency head Esmer Guajardo. In neighboring Hidalgo County, the health department has laid off more than 30 people, said Dr. Ivan Melendez, who helps oversee its operations.</p>\n<p>In July, the Texas Department of State Health Services <a href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/regional-local-health-operations/border-health/operation-border-health-obh-2025\">canceled Operation Border Health</a>, a massive annual event that last year provided free health services to nearly 6,000 South Texas residents.</p>\n<p>Gateway Community Health Center in Laredo, a border city north of the Rio Grande Valley, is in \"survival mode,\" with about a third of patients already lacking insurance and even more who will struggle to afford health care if the ACA subsides aren't renewed, said David Vasquez, its director of communications and public affairs. The center is looking for other forms of funding to avoid layoffs or cuts to services, and its expansion and hiring plans are on hold, Vasquez said.</p>\n<p>That downsizing is happening as more people lose health insurance and need free or reduced-cost care.</p>\n<p>Esther Rodriguez, 39, of McAllen has been out of work for two years and her husband makes $600 a week working in construction. Neither of them has health insurance.</p>\n<p>Medicaid covered the bills for the births of her five children. Now, she depends on a mobile health clinic run by a local medical school, where she can pay out-of-pocket for routine checkups and drugs to control her Type 2 diabetes. If she needed more care, Rodriguez said, she would go to the ER.</p>\n<p>\"You have to adapt,\" she said in Spanish.</p>\n<h3>\"Death by a thousand cuts\"</h3>\n<p>People's inability to pay results in uncompensated care, or services that hospitals, doctors, and clinics don't get paid for, which, under an earlier version of the megabill, was projected to increase by $204 billion over the next decade, <a href=\"https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/2025/06/reconciliation-bill-effects-on-states-healthcare-spending-and-uncompensated-care.html\">according to the Urban Institute</a>, a nonprofit think tank.</p>\n<p>But the Trump administration is also cutting other support that helped offset the cost of care for people who can't pay. The new law <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medicaid-provider-tax-hospitals-gop-spending-cuts-budget/\">caps federal programs</a> that many health providers for low-income people have come to depend on, especially in rural areas, to shore up their budgets. <a href=\"https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mco-medicaid-provider-taxes-matching-funds-threatened-cms-house-california/\">These include taxes</a> on hospitals, health plans, and other providers that states use to help fund their Medicaid programs. Such provider taxes are a \"financial gimmick,\" Desai said.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542408/health-insurance-obbba-texas-uninsurance-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Democrats pressed Patel on a range of issues, including his firing of senior FBI officials and his handling of the investigative files of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Republicans, meanwhile, defended the director and his leadership and made sweeping allegations against the political left in America of conducting a campaign of violence.</p>\n    <p>In his opening statement, Patel defended his tenure.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not going anywhere,\" he said. \"If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on.\"</p>\n    <p>In recent days, he has received pushback for his social media posts and actions during the manhunt for the shooter who killed Kirk. He's also been sued by three former senior FBI officials who allege that he fired them for political reasons.</p>\n    <p>While Republican lawmakers largely praised Patel's work, Democrats were quick to highlight what they see as recent missteps as examples of why they say that he is unfit to lead the FBI.</p>\n    <p>Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the committee, argued that with Patel at the helm, \"the result of that incompetence is staggering.\"</p>\n    <p>\"The men and women who serve at the FBI and the American people deserve a director who has the ability and the character to restore the bureau to its place as the preeminent law enforcement agency,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>Patel, who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/20/g-s1-49696/trump-cabinet-picks-kash-patel\">was confirmed</a> as FBI director in February by a 51-49 vote, appears to enjoy — at least for now — the backing of Trump, who over the weekend expressed support for him.</p>\n    <p>\"I am very proud of the FBI,\" Trump told <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-praises-fbi-director-kash-patel-record-breaking-speed-capture-charlie-kirk-assassin\">Fox News</a>, referring to the capture of the suspected Kirk gunman. \"Kash — and everyone else — they have done a great job.\"</p>\n    <p>The FBI and Utah law enforcement took the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, into custody on Thursday night after his family contacted authorities. The arrest took place roughly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5539285/charlie-kirk-shooting-manhunt-suspect-custody-timeline\">33 hours</a> after Kirk's shooting — a fact that Patel has trumpeted in his public remarks.</p>\n    <h3>Political violence</h3>\n    <p>In the wake of Kirk's assassination, Republicans on the panel spent their allotted time speculating on the potential motivation behind the attack and making broad claims that left-leaning forces are to blame for a culture of political violence.</p>\n    <p>\"The vast majority of Americans are against political violence, but there is a vocal, active minority that encourages and celebrates it, and that minority is overwhelmingly on the left,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.</p>\n    <p>Schmitt went on to reference a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52960-charlie-kirk-americans-political-violence-poll\">recent YouGov poll</a> conducted last week that found that among individuals who identify as very liberal, a quarter said that political violence can sometimes be justified, compared to just 3% of those who say they are very conservative. However, majorities across the ideological spectrum disagreed and said it was never justified. </p>\n    <p>\"We are lying if we think that this is a both sides thing, it's not,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Democrats have also been the subject of political violence, including in recent months. Notably, in June, Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her spouse were murdered in their own home by a man who authorities said had been targeting a list of 45 Democratic elected officials.</p>\n    <p>Senate Democrats pushed back on the characterization by GOP lawmakers that the root cause stems from the left.</p>\n    <p>\"Democrats are not responsible for the murder of Charlie Kirk, and Republicans are not responsible for the murder of Melissa Hortman,\" said Durbin. \"Our political opponents are not our enemies.\"</p>\n    <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., also highlighted that he's observed some right-wing media personalities use violent rhetoric in response to Kirk's death, referencing statements from Alex Jones and Steve Bannon claiming to be \"at war.\"</p>\n    <p>\"There are people out here on our side of the aisle that still need to look in the mirror. Even if you agree that it's a lower number, bad is bad,\" he said.</p>\n    <h3>Scrutiny of social media posts</h3>\n    <p>During the hearing, lawmakers criticized Patel's handling of the investigation into Kirk's death, particularly his social media posts early on in the probe.</p>\n    <p>Just hours after Kirk had been shot and killed last Wednesday, Patel had posted on X that \"the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody.\" Roughly 90 minutes later, he reversed course in a second post, saying \"the subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement. Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency.\"</p>\n    <p>In an exchange with Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., Patel said he didn't see that reversal as a mistake.</p>\n    <p>\"Could I have been more careful in my verbiage and included an 'a subject' instead of 'subject'? Sure, in the heat of the moment,\" he said. \"But I was doing the best I could.\"</p>\n    <p>However, former FBI officials say this is not the way social media platforms are typically used by law enforcement professionals.</p>\n    <p>\"There is a process, and information is always sketchy in the beginning. You take your time, collect the evidence, whatever facts you have, conduct interviews, then see where it will lead. You don't rush out and say the person of interest is the person who did the shooting,\" said Stephen Laycock, a retired former senior FBI agent.</p>\n    <p>\"You typically send out social media notes to help gather information about an investigation. When the investigation leads to having someone in custody who has been identified through the investigative process, and it is a multi-agency effort, you let the unified command put the messaging out together,\" he said, meaning the various law enforcement agencies conducting the investigation put the information out together.</p>\n    <h3>Lawsuit from senior FBI officials</h3>\n    <p>Kirk's killing put a spotlight on Patel's leadership at the bureau, the same day that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/g-s1-87947/fbi-lawsuit-firing-retribution\">three former senior FBI officials sued him</a>.</p>\n    <p>Their <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71309059/1/driscoll-jr-v-patel/\">lawsuit</a> contains details of their interactions with Patel and his deputy, former U.S. Secret Service agent-turned-conservative commentator <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5306990/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director\">Dan Bongino</a>. It describes the leadership at the bureau and the Justice Department as partisan and inept, scrambling to stay in the White House's good graces and willing to fire anyone who crossed the president.</p>\n    <p>Patel vowed at his confirmation hearing that no one at the FBI would be fired for political reasons. But once in the job, the lawsuit says, Patel opted to follow marching orders from the White House instead of federal law.</p>\n    <p>Throughout the hours-long hearing on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly brought up the lawsuit.</p>\n    <p>\"I believe you have made our country weaker and less safe,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. \"You've gutted the bureau of institutional knowledge and expertise. You've fired or pushed out seasoned FBI officials, many with more than 20 years of experience.\"</p>\n    <p>Booker went on to say that in the months since Patel took the job, he has \"assaulted the institutional integrity of the FBI.\"</p>\n    <p>\"As much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America, Donald Trump has shown us in his first term and in this term, he is not loyal to people like you,\" he added. \"He will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you because I don't think you're long for your job.\"</p>\n    <p>\"That rant of false information does not bring this country together,\" Patel said before the two erupted into a shouting match over allotted time.</p>\n    <p>Patel was also pressed by lawmakers on the FBI's handling of the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and insisted there is \"no credible information\" that Epstein trafficked young women to anyone but himself. The FBI has been complying with subpoena requests for files by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Patel said the FBI would \"release whatever we are legally permitted\" to make public.</p>\n    <p>\"I strongly encourage you to do that, Kash,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"This issue is not going to go away.\"</p>\n    <p>The issue has dogged the Trump administration since the summer, when it faced pressure from supporters to release more files.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/g-s1-88926/fbi-director-patel-testimony-congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But tensions are high amid a debate on political violence, complicating their path.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:</p>\n    <p>Two weeks to go for the GOP-led Congress to strike a funding deal and avoid a government shutdown. Now, one new wrinkle in that is finding money to increase security for Washington's political leaders. However, with a broader debate happening over political violence, the path to a bipartisan spending agreement is anything but certain. NPR's congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales is following all of this. So, Claudia, September 30 - that's when the government runs out of money. Both parties seem pretty far apart. What options are on the table?</p>\n    <p>CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, A. Well, a few are on the table. President Trump and this Republican-led Congress have tightly held the reins on money for the government this year. They passed a massive partisan spending and tax plan. They clawed back billions in funding, burning Democrats along the way. For example, earlier this year, Senate Democrats led by minority leader Chuck Schumer helped Republicans push through a stopgap funding bill, but now the clock on that is about to run out. Schumer and other Democrats faced a lot of blowback, and they say they're not going to help Republicans again without getting something in return. Now, they want to see an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies that will expire in December. And then there's also talk of a short-term stopgap measure to buy both sides time to negotiate a full bipartisan spending deal, but it's unclear they're even going to get there.</p>\n    <p>MARTÍNEZ: So it really sounds like a government shutdown is almost certain. I mean, it doesn't sound very good.</p>\n    <p>GRISALES: Maybe. Yeah.</p>\n    <p>MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.</p>\n    <p>GRISALES: No, it doesn't look very good either when we're there. And then there's splits within the parties we could see. For example, fiscal conservatives are once again threatening to vote no, but they've been known to fold. And then, as always, President Trump remains a wild card here. He could upend the whole process. On Monday, he said he wanted to see a short-term funding extension, and Democrats are already saying no to doing that. So we should note Congress is scheduled to be out next week, so there's not a lot of time left to get this done.</p>\n    <p>MARTÍNEZ: All right, so let's shift gears on that and talk about the president's nominations on Capitol Hill. So late last week, Senate Republicans triggered the nuclear option. Tell us more about the nuclear option.</p>\n    <p>GRISALES: Yes, and this was just related to Trump's nominees. Democrats had held up dozens of confirmations for weeks, so Senate leaders finally pulled the trigger on what's known as the nuclear option to bypass the filibuster requiring 60 votes to get this process done that allows a simple majority of Republicans to move certain nominees forward as a bloc, rather doing - than doing all these individual votes. And this applies to lower-level, non-cabinet-level executive branch nominees. So clearly, it marks an expansion of Senate Republicans' power, and Democrats are crying foul. But we haven't seen it go beyond this at this stage.</p>\n    <p>MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, one more thing, Claudia - a big concern with lawmakers are new security measures, especially after what happened with Charlie Kirk last week and the assassination of Charlie Kirk. How are they going to sort through all of that?</p>\n    <p>GRISALES: Right. That's going to be a really, really difficult issue for them to deal with because when you're there, the mood of lawmakers, the accusations, back-and-forth, the blame game - it's really tense right now. That said, lawmakers have said they need new funding to support these heightened security measures, and that's getting folded into the talks over government spending. And the White House, so far, has asked for nearly $60 million to fund new security measures for the judicial and executive branches, so this would include the justices for the Supreme Court. However, now leaders are looking at doing the same for members of Congress. A reminder - both parties are facing more questions than answers right now.</p>\n    <p>MARTÍNEZ: All right, that's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

Joe Manchin of West Virginia about his new memoir, \"Dead Center: In Defense of Common Sense.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n<p>MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:</p>\n<p>How to describe Joe Manchin? To many Republicans, the now retired West Virginia Senator was an occasional ally. To many die-hard Democrats, he might've been a troublesome rogue who couldn't be counted on. But before Manchin served in state office and 15 years in the U.S. Senate, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, he was just the Joe. In his own view, just a man trying to bring common sense to sometimes nonsensical politics.</p>\n<p>He tells us all this in a new memoir that he opens with a walk to the White House in December 2021. Manchin says then-President Biden had called him over because Biden really needed Manchin's vote in order to pass the Build Back Better bill. Manchin said he told the White House he found it too expensive and thought it reinforced what he saw as an entitlement mentality. He says he wasn't the only lawmaker who thought so. As Manchin tells it, words were exchanged, and that was followed by a statement from the White House name-checking Joe Manchin as the holdout.</p>\n<p>JOE MANCHIN: That's when I went off.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Was this always a concern of yours? You've been in public life for some time. I mean, you were in state office before that, as we said. Has it gotten bad?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: It got really bad. And I'll tell you, when it really got to a level that I knew that my family was targeted. So I had to hire some security there, private security to protect my family for a period of time. Thank God we were able to do it.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Yeah. When did that start?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: When I really - me, personally?</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: It was with the Build Back Better, BBB.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Really?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: So you really felt that was the first time when you'd been in public life that you'd been threatened?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: That was the first time that I've ever felt that it could be violent. And I've always thought there's going to be people that raise their voices and maybe try to attack you or fight you or something of that sort. But I never really worried about that. I thought I could always take care of myself, so I never looked at it as a threat.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: What do you think is the origin of all this?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Well, I think the visceral hatred that we have out there. You know, basically, both parties are guilty of - and I say it's a business model. This is a duopoly of Democrat and Republican Party. That's why I'm a fiercely proud independent right now, that I can work with both sides.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You wrote in the book, I have watched the Democratic Party leave me and my state, and I have watched the Republican Party lose itself to one man. Can you just say more about that?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: The party didn't make me. I'm the person I am. And I had a lot of - my dad had great friends who had an R by their name, and I just saw nothing but kumbaya. They were all good buddies that had different ideas. So I never looked at it that way.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: When you say I've watched the Republican Party lose itself to one man, what do you mean by that?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Well, you know, one person can't always be right on everything. First of all, let me just tell you, I know President Trump. The first two years, I worked with him probably closer than any Democrat because he knew that I was - I think one time he and I kidded around. I says, well, I'm a Democrat like you used to be a Democrat, a conservative Democrat. And we ought to all work together. So when they come to me with different things and social services and this and that, and that really comes right back to the BBB, there was so much giveaway. There was no one held accountable and responsible. If you want to get a person out of generational poverty, help them work themselves up. Change the financial cliff, the welfare cliff to a slope. Let them work with some services until they get to a mean wage.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Is it possible, though, that part of it is that your view of politics is shaped by the fact that West Virginia is a very distinct place? Everybody knows everybody. Like, there's six degrees of separation. That just isn't the reality that a lot of people have. And a lot of your colleagues are working in very different environments. Is it possible that there are just things about their context that you don't understand?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Well, I'm sure of that. But a lot of people are able to work in their comfort zones. Think about my state, the least diverse state in the nation. The whitest state in the nation, OK? And here I am, coming from an immigrant family, being a Catholic in a state that basically that's not the norm. So I know this, if you work hard and you try to give back more than what you're willing to take out, they're going to accept you. They love you. You'll be fine.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You know, you have a whole chapter called I Got It Wrong. That was interesting.</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: (Laughter).</p>\n<p>MARTIN: The one that really stood out to me is around the Kavanagh - Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. You said the decision to vote for Brett Kavanaugh did not just create problems for me professionally. My granddaughter, Kelsey, was living with us at the time and working on my campaign. You said that when you got home that day, she was rolled into a ball and cried for hours. And you said that many volunteers working on your campaign quit over that vote. Do you think you were wrong on that vote?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: No, not at all.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: So it's not a - this isn't something you got wrong. What do you...</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Well, I had more...</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: No, no. What I got wrong is not understanding how personal this was to so many people. I should've done a better job of explaining, and I tried to. I would've hoped that basically the FBI report could've been made public. And it should've been made public because I went by that. And I went by also talking to people who had personal relationships with Brett Kavanaugh. I just couldn't see destroying a person's life when I could not find the evidence as he was being charged with.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Well, he wasn't charged criminally. I mean, was destroying a person's life not giving them a job that they want?</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Oh, no. I think at that point in time, you know, you're pretty much - you know, that would be pretty much destroying from the standpoint if he was not able to because they thought, well, that must be all factual. There was nothing factual that I could see for me to make the vote.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: I mean, he was still on the bench, though. He still would've been on the bench. He just wouldn't have been on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: He was on the circuit, yeah.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Yeah, he was on the circuit. Nobody was offering to impeach him. They were just saying that...</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Yeah.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: ...He wasn't fit for that job.</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: Yeah, anyway.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: All right, but your point is the reason that that's in that chapter is that you felt what? That you, that people - you, political figures like yourself...</p>\n<p>MANCHIN: I was wrong in not understanding how emotional this was, how much this meant to so many different people, the way they were affected by it. And I voted my conscience. And I voted the facts that I had in front of me.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: What are you hoping to do with this book at this point? I mean, you report in some detail on some really, you know, tough conversations you had with people. I was just wondering, are you settling scores here? Or is there something else that you are hoping to accomplish?</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5355803/former-sen-joe-manchin-reflects-on-career-state-of-u-s-politics-in-new-memoir\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This report proves that this is not, currently, the case.”</p>\n    <p>She added that the government’s upcoming investigation into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> maternity care must be a “turning point” for black women in particular. “In-built structural racism in maternity services repeatedly fails Black women.<strong> </strong>Acknowledging this and addressing racial disparities in maternal outcomes must be one of the investigation’s core aims,” she added.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Slx0q/1/\">The rate of maternal death in Black women</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The committee also found that given these disparities, it was “indefensible” that cultural competency training was not mandatory for NHS staff working across maternity services. They urged the government, the Royal College of Midwives and the Nursing and Midwifery Council to make the training compulsory for all staff, and that the training should be informed directly by the experience of black women.</p>\n    <p>Inadequate data collection was also cited as a factor for the ethnic disparities across maternity care, with the committee finding that a significant number of individual NHS trusts were failing to consistently record this information, and that this lack of robust data resulted in a system being “blind to its failings”. As a result, the committee also urged the government to accelerate development of a maternal morbidity indicator, which it has already committed to producing.</p>\n    <p>The report comes after previous findings by the advocacy group Five X More, which found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/21/half-of-black-women-in-uk-who-raise-concerns-during-labour-did-not-receive-suitable-help-study-finds\">almost half of pregnant black women</a> raised concerns to healthcare professionals during labour, with half saying that their concerns were not properly addressed.</p>\n    <p>Tinuke Awe, a co-founder of Five X More, said that the committee report was welcomed, and that there was an “urgent need to tackle systemic failings in maternity care” for black women.</p>\n    <p>Awe added: “For too long, Black women have been ignored in maternity care, and the recommendations in this report highlight that change is overdue. We believe now is the time to act. Fix it for Black women, fix it for all women.”</p>\n    <p>Clare Livingstone, the head of policy and practice at the Royal College of Midwives, said that black women being at greater risk during pregnancy and childbirth was a “disgrace”.</p>\n    <p>“The recommendations in this report must be acted upon urgently and everyone in maternity services must work together to tackle these shocking disparities,” Livingstone said. “It should not be the case that these inequalities exist in England today.”</p>\n    <p>A Department of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> and Social Care spokesperson said:“Racism in any form is completely unacceptable and we are determined to reduce the shocking disparities that this report addresses.</p>\n    <p>“We’re already taking action to improve maternity care, including launching an anti-discrimination programme, training thousands more midwives, and introducing new standards to tackle leading causes of maternal mortality.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/17/systemic-racism-affects-maternity-care-for-black-women-in-england-say-mps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Donald Trump has landed in the UK ahead of an unprecedented second state visit.</p>\n    <p>The US president and the first lady, Melania Trump, touched down on Tuesday evening at London Stansted onboard Air Force One ahead of a series of events over the next two days, including being hosted by King Charles, military parades and a possible flypast by the Red Arrows alongside British and American F-35 jets.</p>\n    <p>It comes amid criticism in the UK of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, with the Stop Trump Coalition gathering for a protest in Windsor on Tuesday and the group planning another demonstration in central London on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-londoners-donald-trump-politics\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Sadiq Khan accused the US president of doing more than anyone else to “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/trump-has-fanned-the-flames-of-divisive-politics-around-the-world-says-sadiq-khan\">fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics</a> around the world in recent years”.</p>\n    <p>The mayor of London said the US president’s deployment of the military in US cities and targeting of minorities was “straight out of the autocrat’s playbook”.</p>\n    <p>Khan said that while he understood the pragmatic reasons for maintaining good links with the US, Britain should not be afraid of criticising a leader who alongside his allies had “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.</p>\n    <p>The so-called special relationship between the UK and US, Khan said, “includes being open and honest with each other”, adding: “At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power.”</p>\n    <p>Khan also publicly clashed with Trump during his first state visit in 2019.</p>\n    <p>Donald and Melania Trump were greeted at the foot of the Air Force One steps by the US chief of protocol, Monica Crowley, and were welcomed by Henry Hood, lord-in-waiting, on behalf of the king. Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, was among those assembled near the foot of the aircraft to meet the president off the plane.</p>\n    <p>Trump then walked with his wife to their helicopter, Marine One, which took off at 9.25pm. The Trumps travelled to Winfield House, the official London residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park.</p>\n    <p>On Tuesday, about 70 protesters gathered outside Windsor Castle to demonstrate against Trump’s historic second state visit to the UK, marking the first in a series of planned demonstrations against the US president throughout his stay.</p>\n    <p>The Stop Trump Coalition’s protest stood peacefully on Windsor high street before marching the short distance up to the castle’s King Henry VIII gateway. Separately, four people were arrested on suspicion of malicious communications after images of Trump and the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, Thames Valley police said.</p>\n    <p>People held placards and banners condemning the president, chanting “Trump out” and “say it loud, say it clear: Donald Trump not welcome here”.</p>\n    <p>“After the racist march on Saturday, we need to be out, we need to be heard, we need to show that we don’t support what’s going on in the world right now,” said protester Lisa Bevan.</p>\n    <p>Geoff Holland had come from Southampton to show his support. “[The government] should be cutting ties,” he said. “They should be making him crawl across broken glass and beg for a phone call with us, not rolling out the red carpet. It is repulsive. Does anyone believe that this disgusting man deserves this unprecedented treatment?”</p>\n    <p>Jake Atkinson, spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: “Donald Trump’s politics are politics of fascism and authoritarianism. Not only are we making our voices heard in opposition to Trump and his politics, but we want to send a signal to our government, that this is not how the British people feel, it’s not what the British people want.</p>\n    <p>“We want to stand in solidarity with people in the US, with people in Palestine, with people in Ukraine, and with people all over the world who are seeing Trump’s politics do damage to our democracy and to our planet.</p>\n    <p>King Charles and Camilla will greet Donald and Melania Trump with a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle. As they shake hands, gun salutes will be fired simultaneously by the British army in Windsor and at the Tower of London.</p>\n    <p>The largest guard of honour ever at a state visit will be presented to Trump for inspection, according to the Ministry of Defence. About 1,300 members of the British military and 120 horses will be involved, with 160 personnel from the Royal Marines and Royal Navy, 1,000 from the British army and 140 from the Royal Air Force.</p>\n    <p>The US president, whose taste for pomp and pageantry is well known, will join Charles for a carriage procession towards the castle, accompanied by the sovereign’s escort of the household cavalry mounted regiment.</p>\n    <p>British and US musicians will perform a special Beating Retreat military ceremony, the first time it will be performed at a state visit. The lavish state banquet will feature performances by the Duchess of Edinburgh’s String Orchestra, the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry and pipers from the Scots Guards.</p>\n    <p>Trump will head to Keir Starmer’s country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire on Thursday, with aviators from RAF Halton lining the route on his arrival.</p>\n    <p>In Windsor some came out in support of Trump. Anne Daley, 65, had come from Cardiff, brandishing a cardboard cutout of Trump and wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.</p>\n    <p>She said she hoped Trump’s visit could help broker world peace. “​​We need him inside the tent,” she said of the president. “We need him as an ally. We need America. I hope that when they have afternoon tea with the king, they can [agree] to stop bombing Palestinian people. And stop bombing Ukraine. Children are being killed – for what reason?’</p>\n    <p>One local resident, David Citrine, 73, said he wouldn’t be protesting but felt the demonstration did reflect the views of most UK citizens. “I wouldn’t say he’s my favourite person in the world,” he said. “[The state visit] is obviously to placate Trump, but I’d probably prefer it if he wasn’t coming.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-lands-in-uk-for-second-state-visit-as-protesters-gather-in-windsor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

His appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee was previously scheduled, but it comes after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated amid questions about Patel's leadership of the bureau. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is covering this. Hi, Ryan.</p>\n    <p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: Democrats have had a lot of concerns about Patel's leadership of the FBI, and this hearing gave them a chance to question him on what he's done since he was confirmed. What did they press him on?</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Well, you're right. Democrats - and, it has to be said, FBI and Justice Department veterans as well - have had a lot of concerns about Patel, his character, his ability to handle this big job. At the hearing, Democrats pushed him on a bunch of things, but the main thing that they hit on again and again was the firings and forced resignations that Patel has overseen since he's been FBI director. Some of the people pushed out were among the most senior and lauded agents at the bureau. Three of them recently, in fact, sued him saying that they were pushed out for improper political reasons. Here's how New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker summed things up.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>\n    <p>CORY BOOKER: I believe you have made our country weaker and less safe. I believe that we are more vulnerable to a major event, and I pray to God it doesn't happen. You've gutted the bureau of institutional knowledge and expertise. You've fired or pushed out seasoned FBI officials, many with more than 20 years of experience.</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Now, Booker said quite bluntly at the end that he believes Patel is failing as FBI director.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: How did Patel respond?</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Well, things turned combative several times during the more than four-hour hearing, and includes the exchange that Patel had with Booker. Here's how Patel responded.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>\n    <p>KASH PATEL: That rant of false information does not bring this country together. If you want to work on bringing this country - it's my time, not yours. If you...</p>\n    <p>BOOKER: My God. My God. You're going to lecture me...</p>\n    <p>PATEL: If you want to talk about...</p>\n    <p>BOOKER: ...About dividing this country?</p>\n    <p>PATEL: It is my time.</p>\n    <p>BOOKER: I follow you on your social media posts...</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL BANGING)</p>\n    <p>BOOKER: ...That tear this country apart.</p>\n    <p>PATEL: It is my time to...</p>\n    <p>BOOKER: You should be a unifying...</p>\n    <p>PATEL: ...Address your falsehoods.</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Now, Patel had a similar shouting match with California Democrat Adam Schiff when he pressed Patel about his handling of the files of Jeffrey Epstein. Now, Patel did try several times to highlight what he said were major accomplishments for the FBI under his leadership, including fighting violent crime, going after drug cartels. And he also denied that he had fired anyone for improper political reasons. He said employees are only fired if they fail to uphold the bureau's standards and their oaths to the Constitution.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: Of course, this hearing is just days after Charlie Kirk's killing on the campus of a Utah college. Did Patel say anything new about that investigation?</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Nothing huge, no. Although he did say the FBI is investigating whether anyone else was involved in the shooting, which is curious because officials in Utah had previously said they believe that the suspect acted alone. Now, the broader problem of political violence came up again and again. It was a point of division. Some lawmakers agree that it's a problem across the political spectrum. But some Republicans - chief among them, Missouri Republican Eric Schmitt - placed blame purely on the left, seemingly ignoring examples of Democrats who have been attacked and even killed in recent months.</p>\n    <p>Several Republicans urged Patel to investigate what they describe as networks that they allege are encouraging and funding political violence. Patel largely tried to stay above the left/right blame game, but he did say the FBI was already following the money, although he didn't offer details on whom exactly the bureau was scrutinizing.</p>\n    <p>SHAPIRO: That is NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thanks, Ryan.</p>\n    <p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>(SOUNDBITE OF SAVANA FUNK'S \"GHIBLI\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/12/20/8-facts-about-americans-and-tiktok/\"> surveys</a> from the Pew Research Center, roughly one in three Americans use the app, and about half of adult users say they regularly get their news there.</p>\n    <p>The company's Chinese ownership has made it a target for U.S. politicians for years. In 2024, Congress passed a law banning the app with bipartisan support. The law said that TikTok would be banned in the U.S. within a year unless it was transferred to a U.S.-owned entity. Lawmakers said they had concerns that the data collected by the app could be used to spy on Americans, and so the legislation was designed to compel TikTok's Beijing-based owner, ByteDance, to sell off the U.S. version of the app to American owners.</p>\n    <p>The law banning TikTok went into effect on the eve of Trump's inauguration in January. The app <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/18/nx-s1-5266146/tiktok-offline-supreme-court-ban\"> briefly went dark</a> but Trump issued an executive order pausing enforcement of the ban for 90 days in order to give time for negotiations. </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/04/nx-s1-5347418/trump-tiktok-second-ban-delay\">, Trump has since extended that limit several times, and the latest executive order issued provides for another 90-day extension.</a>\n    </p>\n    <u>While legally questionable</u>\n    <p>The extension comes just as it appears China and the U.S. may finally have a deal on TikTok's fate. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced they had a \"framework\" for a deal with China. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to speak on Friday to complete the deal, he said.</p>\n    <p>As he left the White House for a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump told reporters about the potential agreement, \"We'll be announcing that we have a group of very big companies that want to buy it.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5543413/tiktok-trump-ban-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is unclear if the legislation has enough votes to pass.</p>\n    <p>House Administration Chair Bryan Steil, R-Wis., briefed House Republicans about existing safety resources for members during a closed-door weekly conference meeting Tuesday morning. Safety concerns among lawmakers have grown in the days following the murder of conservative activist and political commentator Charlie Kirk at an event last week at Utah Valley University.</p>\n    <p>\"What we have seen is a broad uptick over the course of the past year of members utilizing the [security] programs,\" Steil said as he left the meeting.</p>\n    <p>The $30 million is in addition to $58 million in security funding for people in the judicial and executive branches recently requested by the White House. The congressional<strong> </strong>allotment<strong> </strong>would be added to a longstanding mutual aid program, which allows for the reimbursement of local law enforcement that help secure lawmakers, particularly when in their home districts. The funding would last until the Nov. 21 end date of the proposed stopgap bill.</p>\n    <h3>Political violence on the rise</h3>\n    <p>Concerns about rising political violence have been brewing for some time. In the last 14 months alone, there were targeted attacks of state lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota, two assassination attempts of President Trump, and arson at the residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.</p>\n    <p>The recent assassination of Kirk, who was a counselor and friend to many Republicans on Capitol Hill, has hit Congress hard.</p>\n    <p>\"The tragedy has also initiated a number of uncomfortable but necessary conversations about important issues like the safety and security of our members,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>Amid various vigils for Kirk, members have reflected on security concerns.</p>\n    <p>\"I found myself over the past couple of days, you know, looking around a little bit more and being a little more careful than I normally would,\" said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., who was one of a handful of House Democrats to join their GOP colleagues at a vigil for Kirk at the Capitol Monday evening.</p>\n    <p>\"People are scared,\" Suozzi said. \"I'm on several different text chains with members, and I just see a lot of comments back and forth about – 'what should we do? How should we spend the money that's been allocated for this? What ideas do you have?'\"</p>\n    <p>In the wake of Kirk's murder, members on both sides of the aisle said they would be adjusting their behavior.</p>\n    <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who's long faced death threats, told reporters last week she was postponing a planned public event.</p>\n    <p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is running for governor, said she was canceling outdoor and public events for the foreseeable future.</p>\n    <p>\"This is a terrifying time,\" she said. \"I will be locked and loaded with one in the chamber because it's unsafe.\"</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://mcusercontent.com/67fba463240fdd948eb636b35/files/4851d4ad-ff54-6be7-7cb7-1fda3ddb9081/Enhanced_Member_Security_Framework.pdf\"> Security guidance</a> sent in July to members was shared again late last week. It includes details of a residential security program and explanations of how local law enforcement can be utilized if threats arise. </p>\n    <p>Following the targeted violence of state lawmakers in Minnesota, the House also launched a pilot program that increased lawmakers' security monitoring and maintenance allotment from $150 to $5,000 a month for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. Members may use that money for personal security while traveling in their district or to protect their home.</p>\n    <p>\"Members that have used the pilot program have seen great success,\" Steil told reporters. \"And it's something I think we have a real opportunity to build on.\"</p>\n    <p>That program is set to expire at the end of the month.</p>\n    <p>The U.S. Capitol Police told NPR its agents are on track to work through roughly <a href=\"https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2024\"> 14,000 threat assessment cases</a> by the end of the year.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F44%2Fbfc787f74b5f80701571c64a3e03%2Fgettyimages-2235644419.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) delivers remarks during a memorial vigil for conservative leader and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol on September 15, 2025.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) delivers remarks during a memorial vigil for conservative leader and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol on September 15, 2025.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <h3>House Democrats held security briefing</h3>\n    <p>Over the weekend, House Democrats held a virtual briefing with the House sergeant at arms and Capitol police, reviewing existing security programs available to members.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't think there's any question that people are very concerned,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D,N.Y., who serves as the ranking member on House Administration. \"I think what happened in Minnesota was a wakeup call for folks. This shortly on the heels of that with another public figure I think just lets members know that this can happen to anyone at any moment.\"</p>\n    <p>He said he doesn't think the $5,000 a month allotted via the pilot program is sufficient.</p>\n    <p>\"We need to do more,\" he said, acknowledging lawmakers must remain sensitive to how much the program costs.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm sure people back home are thinking, well, do we need to really do more for members of Congress in this moment?\" Morelle said. \"But I think it's really just to ensure the integrity of the democracy and the need for people to communicate and talk to their members of Congress.

Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., issued a statement on Tuesday saying they have been working closely with their GOP counterparts on a bipartisan plan. They called on Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to join those talks in order to avoid a shutdown threat.</p>\n    <p>\"House Republican Leadership has decided they would rather take us to the brink of a shutdown instead of working with Democrats on a bipartisan continuing resolution to keep the government funded, protect Congress' power of the purse, and improve health care,\" DeLauro and Murray wrote.</p>\n    <p>Thune focused Tuesday on bipartisan support for a clean government funding extension that would allow Congress to work in regular order to move forward with individual spending bills this fall.</p>\n    <p>Thune said it's Schumer's right to oppose the bill, \"but I would hope there would be Democrat Senators who would give us the requisite number of votes to get to 60 in order to keep the government open.\"</p>\n    <p>House GOP leaders hold a narrow majority and they can only afford to lose two votes. Reps. Tom Massie, R-Ky., and Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, have indicated they oppose the GOP proposal. GOP leaders regularly rely on pressure to back the president among the party's base to get bills through and may need to do that again.</p>\n    <p>The House is expected to vote by Friday. If the measure passes, the Senate will take it up ahead of the September 30 deadline.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5543189/house-republican-stopgap-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Chris Murphy of Connecticut calls efforts to target or silence left-leaning or progressive groups after the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk is \"straight out of the totalitarian playbook.\"</p>\n    <p>Senior members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Vance and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, pledged to use the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to disrupt networks they say are responsible for provoking violence.</p>\n    <p>Speaking to <i>Morning Edition</i>, Murphy said it could be \"a really dark time for this country if mainstream progressive organizations are just labeled as terrorists or as inciters of violence simply because they are working to undermine the president's political agenda.\"</p>\n    <p>Murphy's comments came as at least 30 people across the country have already been fired or investigated over social media posts about Kirk's death and amid calls from Republican officials and right-wing influencers for more crackdowns.</p>\n    <p>Kirk, 31, founder of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, died after being shot in the neck on Sept. 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem. He was a leading figure in mobilizing young voters for Republican politics. A 22-year-old Utah resident named Tyler Robinson was arrested on Friday following a two-day manhunt. On Tuesday, he was charged with seven counts, including aggravated murder.</p>\n    <p>Kirk's death has sparked fierce debate over whether and how he should be honored. Critics point to his incendiary remarks — such as calling Martin Luther King Jr. \"awful\" and demanding Nuremberg-style trials for doctors who provide gender-affirming care. Others, meanwhile, are demanding consequences for those they believe are justifying the murder.</p>\n    <p>Murphy, speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, warned about the risks of political violence, efforts to silence dissent and the dangers of heated rhetoric across the political spectrum.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This interview is edited for length and clarity.</i>\n    </p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <p><strong>Michel Martin</strong>: You<a href=\"https://x.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1967293853461021035\">  posted a message on X over the weekend </a>saying, \"Pay attention. Something dark might be coming.\" What did you mean by that?</p>\n    <p><strong>Sen. Chris Murphy:</strong> As we are all reeling over the assassination of Charlie Kirk and this broader increase in political violence, this was an opportunity, in the wake of the assassination, for the President to try to bring the country together around the work we need to do to try to make sure that violence is unacceptable in any circumstance. But he seems to be doing the opposite. As <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542440/high-profile-conservative-figures-lead-calls-for-critics-of-charlie-kirk-to-be-fired\"> your reporter noted</a>, they are readying what may be a dizzying, high-volume attack on the President's political opponents, essentially exploiting the death of Charlie Kirk to try to eliminate those who are trying to politically stand in opposition to the President's agenda. And I think that that could be a really dark time for this country if mainstream progressive organizations are just labeled as terrorists or as inciters of violence simply because they are working to undermine the President's political agenda. This has been ongoing work for the administration for the last nine months. They've been doing it at a smaller scale, but they now may be readying to ramp up and attempt to really, truly do significant damage to our democracy, and we have to be watchful for it.</p>\n    <p><strong>Martin:</strong> Is it possible that this is the heat of the moment, that,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5538476/charlie-kirk-jobs-target-social-media-critics-resign\">  as our colleagues have been pointing out in the reporting</a>, Charlie Kirk is somebody who had some very close relationships with some of the people in this White House? Is it possible that this is the emotion of the moment?</p>\n    <p><strong>Murphy: </strong>I think that may be true, but I think it's also straight out of the totalitarian's playbook. If you look at other societies where you had an elected leader that decided that they wanted to rule forever, they end up trying to cast and label their political opposition as instigators of violence. So you have, I think, seen all of the ways in which the Trump administration has watched what's happened in places like Turkey and Hungary and copied it, their attacks on the legal profession, their attacks on higher education. This would be a tactic that is not new or unique. It's another mechanism that other would-be autocrats have tried to use to destroy and shut down their political opposition groups.</p>\n    <p><strong>Martin</strong>: How are you advising people to prepare for that? What do you think people should do?</p>\n    <p><strong>Murphy: </strong>First, it is important for us to recognize and say that political violence is unacceptable. We don't yet know the full motives of this shooter, but there have been political assassinations and political assassination attempts that are due to right-wing radicalism and left-wing radicalism, and there should be no one in this country and no one on the left that is celebrating what happened here. But second, it's just a moment where we have to show the President and his team that we are not going to be bullied into submission. That means that, you know, this is a moment for Americans who haven't signed up to join one of these protest groups to do it, for them to support groups that are trying to save our democracy. What the President is going to try to do by going after either the Soros-funded groups or attacking more high-profile politicians that oppose him is to try to convince people to stay on the sidelines, and we've got to show him that that tactic is not going to work.</p>\n    <p><strong>Martin:</strong> Before Charlie Kirk was killed, a White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, pointed to how you said in an interview that Democrats were essentially \"at a war to save this country.\" She was making the point that she thinks Democrats have contributed to this environment of heightened tensions. Do you think Democrats should change the way they talk about some of these issues as well?</p>\n    <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> If you look at the question I was being asked, it was a question about the Republicans' effort to destroy bipartisan redistricting. And I said, yeah, we have a fight on our hands right now to make sure that we can have fair elections in this country. So it is true that politicians on both sides use heated rhetoric when talking about policy.</p>\n    <p><strong>Martin: </strong>But in fairness, do you think there's something you need to do differently when you express yourself on issues like this, to lower the temperature?</p>\n    <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> Well, none of us, including what I said during that interview, comes close to an endorsement or an incitement of violence. And I think this is an attempt by Republicans to try to distract this country from the campaign that they are readying to try to undermine legitimate dissent.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542190/sen-chris-murphy-critics-charlie-kirk-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Official buildings, residences of political leaders and luxury hotels such as the Hilton, which opened in July 2024, were torched, vandalised and looted. The wife of a former prime minister is fighting for her life after their home was set ablaze.</p>\n    <p>The protests represented \"a wholesale rejection of Nepal's current political class for decades of poor governance and exploitation of state resources\", said Ashish Pradhan, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. But the damage to government services, he added, could \"parallel the toll of the 2015 earthquake which took almost 9,000 lives\".</p>\n    <p>The destruction is not only confined to the capital Kathmandu - at least 300 local government offices across the nation have been damaged.</p>\n    <p>The financial losses could amount to 3 trillion Nepalese rupees ($21.3bn; £15.6bn), nearly half of the country's GDP, according to the Kathmandu Post. Its offices were also attacked by crowds and set on fire.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a4b8/live/4406fbb0-9315-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"Instagram / sgtthb Saugat Thapa, in a red sweater and black trousers, stands next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands \"/>\n    <h2>'Nepo babies'</h2>\n    <p>Two days before the deadly demonstration on 8 September, Ms Pandey, a 24-year-old environmental campaigner, uploaded a video showing a mining site in Chure, one of the most fragile mountain ranges in the region. Nepal's resources should belong to the people, not to \"politicians' private limited companies\", she wrote, calling on her peers to \"march against corruption and the misuse of our nation's wealth\".</p>\n    <p>Like many youth movements in Asia, Nepal's Gen Z protests were leaderless. Others had made similar pleas to Ms Pandey's after the Nepali government decided to ban 26 social media platforms, citing their failure to register locally.</p>\n    <p>For months, fury had been brewing against \"nepo babies\", the children of powerful politicians of all stripes, who were accused of flaunting their unexplained wealth on social media.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DEDKrLfyZ_3/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">One of the most viral photos showed Saugat Thapa</a>, the son of a provincial minister, standing next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. In response, he said it was \"an unfair misinterpretation\" and his father \"returned every rupee earned from public service to the community\".</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey had watched almost all \"nepo babies\" content, but one video juxtaposing the luxurious life of a political family and an ordinary young Nepali who had to find work in a Gulf country struck her.</p>\n    <p>\"It is painful to watch, especially knowing that even educated youth are forced to leave the country because wages here are far below what one needs to live with dignity,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Nepal is a young democracy. It became a republic in 2008, after a decade-long, Maoist-led civil war that killed more than 17,000 people.</p>\n    <p>But the promised stability and prosperity have not materialised. In 17 years, Nepal has had 14 governments, and no leader has completed a full five-year term. The country's politics resemble a game of musical chairs, with communist parties and the centrist Nepali Congress taking turns to rule. Three leaders, including KP Sharma Oli who resigned over the Gen Z protests, returned to power multiple times.</p>\n    <p>Nepal's GDP per capita remained under $1,500, making it the second-poorest country in South Asia, behind only Afghanistan. An estimated 14% of the population work overseas, and one in three households receives remittances.</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey comes from a middle-class family in eastern Nepal and her father is a retired government teacher. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which she is still receiving treatment. The medical bills nearly bankrupted her family, so her older sister moved to Australia to support them.</p>\n    <p>Before the protests, Ms Pandey worked with others to create guidelines stressing non-violence and respect and reminding participants to stay vigilant against \"hijackers\".</p>\n    <p>On the morning of 8 September, she arrived at Maitighar Mandala, a huge traffic island in central Kathmandu with several of her friends. She was expecting thousands would turn up at most – but the crowds kept swelling.</p>\n    <p>Aakriti Ghimire, a 26-year-old protester, said things were initially peaceful and communal. \"We were all seated, we were singing old Nepali songs,\" she said. \"The slogans and everything were so funny, we were enjoying it. And after that, we started to march… the police were there to ensure that there were no vehicles disturbing us.\"</p>\n    <p>Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire started to sense danger at around midday, when crowds began moving to New Baneshwor, the neighbourhood housing parliament. Both saw people arriving on motorbikes, and Ms Pandey said these people appeared older than average Gen Z protesters.</p>\n    <p>Ms Ghimire believes they were infiltrators. \"It became very tricky for us to distinguish the peaceful protesters – some people who genuinely came for something – versus those who came in with the intention of being violent.\"</p>\n    <p>When some protesters tried to breach the security around parliament, police fired tear gas, water cannon and shots in return. There is evidence live rounds were used and they are accused of shooting at schoolchildren as well. An investigation into what happened is under way.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ede5/live/c6036440-9316-11f0-be26-dfb5c8eb987f.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Smoke rises from the burnt Hilton Kathmandu hotel, following protests against Monday's killing of 19 people after anti-corruption protests triggered by a social media ban \"/>\n    <p>Chaos and violence reigned the next day. Demonstrators retaliated by setting parliament, the prime minister's office and other government buildings ablaze. Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire stayed indoors and watched the developments online.</p>\n    <p>\"A lot of people did share that it felt so good to finally see politicians face the consequences of everything they've done,\" Ms Ghimire said, referring to the destruction of the leaders' homes. But the mood soon darkened.</p>\n    <p>\"I saw people with bottles filled with petroleum. They got it from the motorbikes. They started attacking the parliament,\" said Ms Pandey.</p>\n    <p>The law graduate cried after seeing the Supreme Court on fire, saying that it was like \"a temple\" for her. Her friends at the scene were pouring water on the flames to try to put them out. They all knew the effort would be futile – they did it only to console themselves.</p>\n    <p>\"People say the arsonists intended to come and burn these things… Who are these people?\" asked Ms Ghimire. \"The videos show these people are all masked.\"</p>\n    <p>Some calm was restored when the army was deployed to take control of the situation - a curfew was in place for days. Later in the week <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c179qne0zw0o\">former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister</a>. She had been backed by protesters for the post. </p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey hopes she \"can lead the country efficiently, do the election in stipulated time and hand the power to the people\".</p>\n    <p>But the anxiety about Nepal's political future persists.</p>\n    <p>Rumela Sen, a South Asia expert at Columbia University, said it was \"worrying\" to see \"an unprecedented glorification of the army as a voice of sanity and stability\".</p>\n    <p>Many are also uncomfortable with the involvement of Durga Prasai in the initial negotiation at the invitation of the military. Mr Prasai was arrested for his role in violent pro-monarchy protests in March. He fled to India but was returned to Nepal. The Gen Z protesters walked out.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8dec/live/35d5bb80-92de-11f0-950e-eb051178bae0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters People take part in a candlelight vigil in memory of people who died during the protest against anti-corruption triggered by a social media ban \"/>\n    <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zkmxlkm9o\">families of protesters who were killed are reckoning with their deaths</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"We are deeply shocked because we have lost our beloved son,\" said Yubaraj Neupane, whose 23-year-old son Yogendra died in the protests. \"I am yet to find out how he died.\"</p>\n    <p>Yogendra was shot in the back of the head near the parliament building, according to the post mortem report.</p>\n    <p>From south-eastern Nepal, the family's eldest son had pursued his studies in Kathmandu and aspired to be a civil servant. He was always studying, friends and relatives said.</p>\n    <p>But on 8 September, he joined the protests with his friends, dreaming of bringing change to the country. His family didn't know he was at the scene until he called them after the situation started heating up.</p>\n    <p>\"Our beloved has lost his life calling for change,\" his great-uncle Saubhagya said. \"His blood and sacrifice should be recognised so that other young people won't have to hit the streets again in the future.\"</p>\n    <p>Ms Pandey said she was cautiously optimistic about her country's future, but the trauma of the past week would stay with her for the rest of her life.</p>\n    <p>This is a political awakening for her generation.</p>\n    <p>\"We are no longer willing to stay silent or accept injustice,\" she says. \"This is not just a gentle nudge; it's a bold challenge to a system that has hoarded power for decades.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Additional reporting by Grace Tsoi</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9n760gddo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25% - the lowest level since late 2022.</p>\n    <p>The move - the bank's first rate cut since last December - is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US.</p>\n    <p>But they carry a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Nor are they likely to satisfy the president, who has called for far deeper cuts.</p>\n    <p>In many ways, it is no surprise that the Fed, which sets interest rate policy independent of the White House, is cutting.</p>\n    <p>The inflation that ripped through the post-pandemic economy and prompted the bank to raise interest rates in 2022 has come down significantly.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, Europe, Canada and elsewhere, central banks have already responded with lower rates, while the Fed's own policymakers have said for months that they expected to lower borrowing costs by at least half a percentage point this year.</p>\n    <p>At the Fed's last meeting, two members of the board even backed a cut.</p>\n    <p>They were outvoted, as other members remained worried that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, tariffs and mass detentions of migrant workers, might cause inflation to flare back up again.</p>\n    <p>And it's true that the US in recent months has seen inflation tick higher. Prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to August, the fastest pace since January, and still above the Fed's 2% target.</p>\n    <p>But in recent weeks, those concerns have been eclipsed by weakness in the labour market. The US reported meagre job gains in August and July and an outright loss in June - the first such decline since 2020.</p>\n    <p>\"It really comes down to what we've seen in the jobs market - the deterioration that we've seen over the past few months,\" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, which is expecting rates to drop by 0.75 percentage points by the end of the year.</p>\n    <p>\"The Fed knows that when the labour market turns, it turns very quickly, so they're wanting to make sure they're not stepping on the brakes of the economy at the same time the labour market has already slowed.\"</p>\n    <p>Though Trump has rejected concerns about economic weakness, the rate cut should not be unwelcome to him<strong> </strong>- he has spent months blasting the Fed's hesitance to cut rates, which he says should be as low as 1%. </p>\n    <p>On social media, he has called Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell \"a real dummy\", accusing him of holding back the economy by leaving interest rates too high for too long.</p>\n    <p>\"Too Late\" MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND. HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!\" Trump wrote in a social media post this week, referring to Powell.</p>\n    <p>Trump's pressure is not just rhetorical. He moved quickly to install the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, on the Fed in time for this week's meeting after a short-term vacancy opened up last month.</p>\n    <p>His administration has also threatened Powell with firing and investigation and is locked in a legal battle over its effort to fire economist Lisa Cook, another member of the board.</p>\n    <p>To critics, Trump's moves amount to an assault on the Fed's independence that is unprecedented in recent history.</p>\n    <p>But whatever awkwardness in the air at this week's Fed meeting, analysts say they believe the Fed's decision to cut would have come regardless of his campaign.</p>\n    <p>\"The president's policies are certainly causing the economic activity that is forcing the hand of the Fed,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth.</p>\n    <p>\"The president's jawboning of the Fed to lower rates I think has had zero impact whatsoever.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75y90pw0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She is wearing a white shirt and trousers with a flower pattern on them\"/>\n    <p>For learner drivers, Ms Howe said, automatics can make the test easier, as \"there's just a lot less to do\".</p>\n    <p>Inexperienced drivers can \"wreck a gearbox and a clutch\", Ms Howe said, adding that nerves may cause them to stall or cut out the engine.</p>\n    <p>She also said the trend was good for road safety as \"people are less tired\" driving an automatic.</p>\n    <p>\"It just makes life so much easier - it's less work for the driver to do so they can concentrate more time on the road.\"</p>\n    <p>Drivers attitudes to EVs have rapidly changed in just over a decade.</p>\n    <p>The number of driving tests taken in automatics was 87,844 in 2012/13, or 6.12% of all tests, according to the DVSA figures.</p>\n    <p>That figure jumped to 479,556 in 2024/25, the last period with complete data, or 26%.</p>\n    <p>The AA is predicting that 29% of all tests will be taken in automatics in 2025/26.</p>\n    <p>The figures from the DVSA also showed that more men are opting to take their tests in automatics.</p>\n    <p>In 2012/13, 23.2% of learners taking tests in automatics were men. Last year, that figure was 39.1%.</p>\n    <p>The pass rate for automatics last year was slightly lower than for manuals. However, the gap has narrowed since 2012.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80gk97xe85o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Structure-wise we are standing really good and we all know what to do, so we're a difficult team to beat.\"</p>\n    <p>The style of Frank's Tottenham side against Villarreal was in stark contrast to the swashbuckling football played under Postecoglou.</p>\n    <p>They were much more cautious, even after being gifted a fourth-minute opener thanks to a calamitous mistake by Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior.</p>\n    <p>But their defence was excellent, with Van de Ven in particularly halting most of Villarreal's attacks.</p>\n    <p>Even though the visitors had 10 shots, Guglielmo Vicario didn't have a save to make throughout.</p>\n    <p>The price for that level of pragmatism was that Tottenham themselves only had one shot on target - very little for the home fans to get excited about.</p>\n    <p>\"We defended really well and gave little away throughout the game against a really good Villarreal side,\" Frank said.</p>\n    <p>\"I think offensively we didn't hit the highest level.

Also, I knew we took a step forward against West Ham, offensively is the area we need to get better.\"</p>\n    <h2>Related topics</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published15 August</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"A graphic of Premier League players from every team in the division in 2025-26 season, with the Premier League trophy in front of them.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/91b6/live/4a573810-8e3b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg 976w\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160.2160216021603\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Published16 August</li>\n        </ul>\n        <graphic alt=\"BBC Sport microphone and phone\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/815/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/b2c7/live/922d6170-544c-11ef-aebc-6de4d31bf5cd.jpg 800w\" width=\"815\" height=\"459\" class=\"ssrcss-11yxrdo-Image edrdn950\"/>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwywnrd24deo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>It is one of China’s most popular shopping apps, selling clothing, groceries and just about everything else under the sun to more than 750 million users a month.</p>\n<p>But according to cybersecurity researchers, it can also bypass users’ cell phone security to monitor activities on other apps, check notifications, read private messages and change settings.</p>\n<p>And once installed, it’s tough to remove.</p>\n<p>\n            While many apps collect vast troves of user data, sometimes without explicit consent, experts say e-commerce giant Pinduoduo<strong> </strong>has taken violations of privacy and data security to the next level.\n    </p>\n<p>In a detailed investigation, CNN spoke to half a dozen cybersecurity teams from Asia, Europe and the United States — as well as multiple former and current Pinduoduo employees — after receiving a tipoff.</p>\n<p>Multiple experts identified the presence of malware on the Pinduoduo app that exploited vulnerabilities in Android operating systems. Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.</p>\n<p>“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.</p>\n<p>“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”</p>\n<p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.</p>\n<p>\n            Some American lawmakers are pushing for a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/tiktok-ban-national-security-hearing/index.html\">national ban</a> on the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chew <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/tech/tiktok-ceo-hearing/index.html\">was grilled</a> by Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/16/tech/temu-shopping-app-us-popularity-intl-hnk/index.html\">topping US download charts</a> and fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.\n    </p>\n<p>While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.</p>\n<p>\n            There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/media/tiktok-ceo-congress-reliable-sources/index.html\">there are concerns</a> from US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The findings follow <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">Google’s suspension</a> of Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pinduoduo-app-malware-detailed-by-cybersecurity-researchers?sref=IIP4JEyu\">ensuing report</a> from Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/tech/china-google-pinduoduo-malware-app-intl-hk/index.html\">previously rejected</a> “the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”\n    </p>\n<p>CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.</p>\n<h2>Rise to success</h2>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population and<strong> </strong>a market value three times that of eBay\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=EBAY&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (EBAY)</a>, wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Founded in 2015 in Shanghai by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/tech/pinduoduo-colin-huang-intl-hnk/index.html\">Colin Huang</a>, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BABA&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (BABA)</a> and JD.com\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=JD&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (JD)</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.</p>\n<p>\n            Pinduoduo posted triple digit<a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\"> growth</a> in monthly users until the end of 2018, the year <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/26/technology/pinduoduo-ipo-china-startup/index.html\">it listed</a> in New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to its <a href=\"https://investor.pddholdings.com/financial-information/quarterly-results\">earnings reports</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>It was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.</p>\n<p>According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>\n<p>“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.</p>\n<p>By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.</p>\n<p>This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.</p>\n<p>The team was disbanded in early March, the source added, after questions about their activities came to light.</p>\n<p>PDD didn’t reply to CNN’s repeated requests for comment on the team.</p>\n<h2>What experts found</h2>\n<p>Approached by CNN, researchers from Tel Aviv-based cyber firm Check Point Research, Delaware-based app security startup Oversecured and Hyppönen’s WithSecure conducted independent analysis of the 6.49.0 version of the app, released on Chinese app stores in late February.</p>\n<p>Google Play is not available in China, and Android users in the country download their apps from local stores. In March, when Google suspended Pinduoduo, it said it had found malware in off-Play versions of the app.</p>\n<p>The researchers found code designed to achieve “privilege escalation”: a type of cyberattack that exploits a vulnerable operating system to gain a higher level of access to data than it’s supposed to have, according to experts.</p>\n<p>“Our team has reverse engineered that code and we can confirm that it tries to escalate rights, tries to gain access to things normal apps wouldn’t be able to do on Android phones,” said Hyppönen.</p>\n<p>The app was able to continue running in the background and prevent itself from being uninstalled, which allowed it to boost its monthly active user rates, Hyppönen said. It also had the ability to spy on competitors by tracking activity on other shopping apps and getting information from them, he added.</p>\n<p>Check Point Research additionally identified ways in which the app was able to evade scrutiny.</p>\n<p>The app deployed a method that allowed it to push updates without an app store review process meant to detect malicious applications, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>They also identified in some plug-ins the intent to obscure potentially malicious components by hiding them under legitimate file names, such as Google’s.</p>\n<p>“Such a technique is widely used by malware developers that inject malicious code into applications that have legitimate functionality,” they said.</p>\n<h2>Android targeted</h2>\n<p>\n            In China, about three quarters of smartphone users are on the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/tech/huawei-harmony-os/index.html\">Android system</a>. Apple\n            <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link\">\n                (AAPL)</a>’s iPhone has 25% market share, according to Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n    </p>\n<p>Sergey Toshin, the founder of Oversecured, said Pinduoduo’s malware specifically targeted different Android-based operating systems, including those used by Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.</p>\n<p>CNN has reached out to these companies for comment.</p>\n<p>Toshin described Pinduoduo as “the most dangerous malware” ever found among mainstream apps.</p>\n<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this before. It’s like, super expansive,” he said.</p>\n<p>Most phone manufacturers globally customize the core Android software, the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), to add unique features and applications to their own devices.</p>\n<p>Toshin found Pinduoduo to have exploited about 50 Android system vulnerabilities. Most of the exploits were tailor made for customized parts known as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code, which tends to be audited less often than AOSP and is therefore more prone to vulnerabilities, he said.</p>\n<p>Pinduoduo also exploited a number of AOSP vulnerabilities, including one which was flagged by Toshin to Google in February 2022. Google fixed the bug this March, he said.</p>\n<p>According to Toshin, the exploits allowed Pinduoduo access to users’ locations, contacts, calendars, notifications and photo albums without their consent. They were also able to change system settings and access users’ social network accounts and chats, he said.</p>\n<p>Of the six teams CNN spoke to for this story, three did not conduct full examinations. But their primary reviews showed that Pinduoduo asked for a large number of permissions beyond the normal functions of a shopping app.</p>\n<p>They included “potentially invasive permissions” such as “set wallpaper” and “download without notification,” said René Mayrhofer, head of the Institute of Networks and Security at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in Austria.</p>\n<h2>Disbanding the team</h2>\n<p>\n            Suspicions about malware in Pinduoduo’s app were first raised in late February in a <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/P_EYQxOEupqdU0BJMRqWsw\">report</a> by a Chinese cybersecurity firm called Dark Navy. Even though the analysis didn’t directly name the shopping giant, the report spread quickly among other researchers, who did name the company. Some of the analysts followed up with <a href=\"https://github.com/davincifans101/pinduoduo_backdoor_detailed_report/blob/main/README.md\">their own reports</a> confirming the original findings.\n    </p>\n<p>Soon after, on March 5, Pinduoduo issued a new update of its app, version 6.50.0, which removed the exploits, according to two experts who CNN spoke to.</p>\n<p>Two days after the update, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits, according to the Pinduoduo source.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cnn.it/40OSomK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

What happened in the '40s, '50s, '60s, there was a project, it was a collaboration between the Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Foundation, which was the research arm of the Mayo clinic, and the Hormel Institute, which was the research arm of pork. The goal here was to create a smaller pig, a pig that would be a good match in terms of not just the size of human organs, but the functions. There were all these studies were done looking at do pigs get coronary artery disease? And it turns out they do. In fact, the pig was described in one of their papers as a caricature of an obese human. In other words, gets heart disease, has heart issues, doesn't get enough exercise. …</p>\n    <p>If you are going to use the pig as your model, as your stand-in for a human, then you want to be sure that these organs ... behave similarly, that they have a similar size. So this research, once it got rolling, and there were dozens and dozens of papers, three volumes of papers looking at kidney function, liver function. There was one on orthodontia where they had put braces onto pigs. So it was all toward the goal of creating an analog, a stand-in for a human being for trying out surgical techniques or not so much pharmaceuticals, but techniques and replacements. So the pig became the go-to creature. … I mean who knows, a goat might've been equally useful, but nobody started using goats.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On preventing the body from rejecting a pig organ </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>With an organ that's coming from another species, the reaction is quite severe. It's called a hyperacute rejection, where, within minutes, the body starts to attack, the organ starts to turn black. You don't want to put a pig organ into somebody without it having been genetically edited. So one of the things that's edited is something called the alpha-gal protein. And this is a surface protein that the body, if you can knock that out, you're basically just making the pig organ seem a little less pig-like and a little more human-like. So now you're dealing with a level of rejection that you would get with a human transplant. In other words, taking some other human's organ and transplanting it. So the person is still on an immunosuppressive regimen, taking drugs to suppress the immune system. But on about the same level as they would with a human.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On if a pig transplant is kosher </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I asked the surgeon who was involved in the first pig transplant … and he said, yeah, there are a lot of folks both in the Jewish religion and the Muslim religion who really wish we'd chosen a different species, because I had been asking him, why pigs? And he says, I get that question all the time. The thing is, he said, we're not eating them, we are saving lives. So it's OK to get a pig organ if you're keeping kosher. ... There were interviews with various religious thought leaders and there was consensus that it is indeed OK to have a pig organ implanted. Just don't eat it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiments 3D printing muscle and tissue </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I spent a day at the Feinberg lab at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, and what people were working on there was trying to print muscle in a way that the alignment of the cells would create muscle that had the specific function that muscle needed. In other words, a heart, the heart needs to move in a kind of a twisting motion. It twists as it pumps, so you've got to print the cells. They have to be in a helix shape, which is different from, say, the hamstring, where it'd be kind of parallel. Or the shoulder muscle, they're in a fan-like shape, which gives you a lot of the versatility of the movement of the shoulder. So you're not just printing generic muscle. You have to print it in a very specific way to achieve the function that you want it to be doing, which I found kind of amazing. No one is printing whole organs. That's way off in the future.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the tediousness of tissue recovery for organ donations </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I arrived in the room where they were doing the tissue recovery, where they would be extracting the bone and the tendon and the skin, etc., one of the people doing it said to me, this is the worst part of the job. And I kind of assumed I had preconceived notions of what the worst of that job might be, but she was talking about handwriting on labels the same ID number over and over, double checking, cross checking, the amount of paperwork and labeling, and then at the end, packing and shipping was the tedious and unpleasant part of her job, not the opening up of a leg and the extracting of bone or ligament. I guess I just wasn't expecting that.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On how knowing too much about how our bodies work can get in your head</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>When I wrote <i>Gulp ...</i> I became really aware of what's going on in your mouth when you chew, the process of bolus formation, where you're taking a piece of meat, say, and you're breaking it down and then you're putting it back together in a bolus that's a shape that can slide down the throat. And I visited somebody who studies chewing and this process and what the jaws do, and I remember for a while after that going to restaurants and thinking, looking around at people chewing and swallowing and thinking this is disgusting. People should have sex in public and eat in private! It's absolutely disgusting.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

This week sees the release of several works of fiction that challenge or outright shrug off the hard rigors of the day-to-day, in pursuit of something far more <i>out there</i>: proof, at least in concept, that other worlds are possible.</p>\n    <p>But this week's publishing calendar also offers help for readers seeking to understand, or simply cope with, <i>this</i> one.

Only, the thought experiment is typically framed as a simple either-or, with the Axis powers subbed in as victors — as in Philip K. Dick's paragon of the form, <i>The Man in the High Castle</i>. Here, though, Chidgey imagines an outcome in which a treaty leaves no clear victor, and in which the U.K. carries on with the caveat that Nazi crimes have become useful scientific precedent. The New Zealand novelist centers the perspectives of teenage British triplets, caught several decades later in a turbid world where the line between political and scientific subject has become disturbingly unclear.</p>\n    <h3>Buy Featured Book</h3>\n    <p>Your purchase helps support NPR programming. <a href=\"https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/articles/2168887-how-can-my-online-purchases-support-npr-programming\">How?</a></p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1500x1500+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F47%2F46%2F19062bdf48a5a4022eeb22de3396%2F81joka6-jol-sl1500.jpg\" alt=\"Dealing with the Dead: A Novel, by Alain Mabanckou\"/>\n    <p><i>Dealing with the Dead: A Novel,</i> by Alain Mabanckou, translated by Helen Stevenson</p>\n    <p>For years, fairly or unfairly, Mabanckou has gamely shouldered the mantle of \"African Samuel Beckett.\" Born in what's now the Republic of Congo, now based in the U.S., the francophone's nickname comes from his philosophical bent and keen sense of the absurd.

Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be over-hyped or under-hyped but also said the newborn tech would still bring about new products, new systems and new infrastructure.</p>\n    <p>He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. He added that investing in data centres was \"effectively\" also investing in modernising the power grid but did not say that money would be shared directly with the UK's power supplier, the National Grid.</p>\n    <p>The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".</p>\n    <p>The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g3dr4n4no\">already announced</a> by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.</p>\n    <h2>Big tech comes to town</h2>\n    <p>Mr Nadella, revealed the investment as Donald Trump has arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit</p>\n    <p>The UK and US have signed a \"Tech Prosperity Deal\" as part of the visit, with an aim of strengthening ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmek723dz9o\">promised £5bn</a> for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.</p>\n    <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves opened a £735m data centre as part of the investment on Tuesday in Hertfordshire.</p>\n    <p>There are some concerns that accepting so much money from US investors will mean the UK relies too much on foreign technology.</p>\n    <p>In July, Trump made clear his intentions were for the US to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8nxrk207o\">win global the AI race</a>.</p>\n    <p>One of the ways it stated it would do this was to \"export American AI to allies and partners.\"</p>\n    <p>The UK government has signed number of deals with US technology companies, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv68gejm7o\">an agreement to use OpenAI services</a> in the public sector and a £400m contract to use Google Cloud services in the Ministry of Defence.</p>\n    <p>Satya Nadella said he thought the agreement defined \"the next phase of globalisation\" and argued that having access to foreign tech services leveraged digital sovereignty rather than threatened it.</p>\n    <p>On the growing issue of AI taking over jobs, Nadella said Microsoft also had to \"change with the changes in technology\", having laid off thousands of staff this year despite record sales and profits. He described it as \"the hard process of renewal\".</p>\n    <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England</h2>\n    <p>The government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crr05jykzkxo\">AI growth zone</a>\".</p>\n    <p>Last year, the government announced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e957k9d1yo\">a £10bn investment into a data centre</a> to be built near Blyth, Northumberland.</p>\n    <p>It has now announced another data centre project dubbed Stargate UK from OpenAI, chipmaker Nvidia, semiconductor company Arm and AI infrastructure firm Nscale.</p>\n    <p>That will be based at Cobalt Park in Northumberland.</p>\n    <p>OpenAI boss Sam Altman said Stargate UK would \"help accelerate scientific breakthroughs, improve productivity, and drive economic growth.\"</p>\n    <p>However the UK version is a fraction of the firm's US-based Stargate project, which OpenAI launched in January with a commitment to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for itself.</p>\n    <p>So far, reaction to the agreement has been broadly positive, but its clear that there are many challenges ahead for the UK if it is to fulfil its intended potential.</p>\n    <p>The Tony Blair Institute described the news as a \"breakthrough moment\" but added that Britain had some work to do: \"reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure for powering the country's tech-enabled growth agenda,\" said Dr Keegan McBride, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change's emerging tech and geopolitics expert.</p>\n    <p>Matthew Sinclair, UK director of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, hailed the agreement as \"a powerful demonstration of the scale of the AI opportunity for the UK economy.\"</p>\n    <p>But the Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.</p>\n    <p>Satya Nadella spoke to the BBC News in between board meetings, shortly before jumping on a flight to join Donald Trump as he arrives in the UK on a three-day state visit. Nadella will be among other tech leaders, including OpenAI's Sam Altman and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, attending the Royal state banquet on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>He said he would use Microsoft's AI tool Copilot to help him decide what to wear.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very surprised that there was a very different dress protocol, which I'm really not sure that I'm ready for,\" he said.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41d3/live/348b21e0-26a8-11f0-8f57-b7237f6a66e6.png.webp\" alt=\"A green promotional banner with black squares and rectangles forming pixels, moving in from the right.

We are clear with Israel that this is no way to treat British Parliamentarians.\"</p>\n    <p>The two MPs were crossing into Israel from Jordan on Monday on a three-day visit organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) when they were stopped by Israeli authorities.</p>\n    <p>Opher told the BBC they were held in a passport office before being handed a \"legal form insisting that we leave the country\" and then \"escorted to a bus\" back to Jordan.</p>\n    <p>The Stroud MP said he was told they were not being admitted on \"public order\" grounds and that representations from the Foreign Office to Israeli authorities had been rejected.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"It's very disappointing. We are both doctors and we were really just going to look at healthcare facilities in the West Bank to see if there was anything we could do to support them.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We weren't in any way trying to undermine the Israelis, just trying to see what we could do in the West Bank\" where, he said, they had been told healthcare was getting increasingly difficult.</p>\n    <p>They had also been due to meet the British Consul General in Jerusalem as part of the visit, as well as meeting Palestinian and Israeli human rights organisations.</p>\n    <p>Both Prinsley, who represents Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, and Opher were first elected to Parliament in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Chris Doyle, the Director of CAABU, told the BBC that it had been organising trips for parliamentarians for many years and that recent denials of entry were \"regrettable\".</p>\n    <p>He said it was \"important that British politicians get to see the situation on the ground at a very serious time to determine what's going on. It allows them to assess that situation and British policy towards it\".</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, two other Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were denied entry to Israel in April on another visit organised by the same organisation.</p>\n    <p>At the time Israeli authorities said the two MPs had \"accused Israel of false claims\" and were \"actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers\".</p>\n    <p>Mohamed and Yang said: \"Parliamentarians should feel free to speak truthful in the House of Commons, without fear of being targeted.\"</p>\n    <p>The then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the move by Israel as \"unacceptable, counterproductive and deeply concerning\".</p>\n    <p>In April, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse was barred from entering Hong Kong to visit her newborn grandson.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge2gweqzjno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He was in the US only for a few weeks on a short-term visa, he thought to himself.</p>\n    <p>Then the armed agents burst into his room and ordered him outside. They handcuffed him, before attaching chains to his waist and ankles, and loaded him onto a bus bound for a detention centre.</p>\n    <p>\"I panicked and my mind went blank. I felt sick,\" he told the BBC, now back home in South Korea.</p>\n    <p>\"I couldn't understand why I was being treated like this.\"</p>\n    <p>Youngjin is one of more than 300 Korean workers who were detained in the US state of Georgia earlier this month, in one of the largest immigration raids of Donald Trump's presidency to date. He and others interviewed for this article didn't want to reveal their real names in order to protect their identity.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae69/live/02e8e870-92f0-11f0-ad9f-17dac350ed4d.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC/ Hosu Lee Youngjin sitting at a desk in his home\"/>\n    <h2>'Helicopters and drones… people with guns'</h2>\n    <p>US officials initially claimed the workers had been in the country illegally on incorrect visas, but eventually the two sides struck a deal allowing them to leave voluntarily without any penalties, so they could return to work there in the future.</p>\n    <p>Most of the workers were in the US temporarily, helping to build an electric car battery plant run by two South Korean companies, Hyundai and LG – part of a US push to get foreign companies to invest and manufacture more in the states.</p>\n    <p>LG said that many of its employees who were arrested had various types of visas or were under a visa waiver programme. And so they were especially shocked by the raid.</p>\n    <p>\"We just came out for a brief break and I could see a lot of people, officials with guns. As Koreans, we just thought they were here to arrest criminals, but then, they suddenly started arresting us,\" said Chul-yong, who was also detained that day.</p>\n    <p>He said they tried to explain who they were, but they were terrified: \"There were helicopters and drones, armoured vehicles… people with guns.\"</p>\n    <p>There were some officers pointing guns at workers, he claimed. \"You know those red lasers that come out of those guns? It was so shocking that some people were shivering in fear.\"</p>\n    <p>Even those who managed to share their visa details said they were arrested. \"I thought everything would be cleared up but instead, they suddenly shackled us,\" said Mr Kim, another worker detained, who only wanted to reveal his last name.</p>\n    <p>Chul-yong said there was a shackle around his ankles and another around his waist, connected to handcuffs. \"It was so tight, I couldn't touch my face with my hands.\"</p>\n    <p>They all said they had no idea why this was happening, or where they were being taken. \"I later learned that I was detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center,\" added Chul-yong, a software engineer. He had been planning to stay for about a month but was arrested on his sixth day there.</p>\n    <h2>'It was freezing... the water smelt like sewage'</h2>\n    <p>Youngjin, an engineer and sub-contractor for LG, was scheduled to be there for five weeks to train staff to operate some of the specialist high-tech equipment.</p>\n    <p>The 30-year-old was shaking, still visibly upset, as he described to the BBC being taken to the detention centre and locked in a room with 60-70 other people.</p>\n    <p>\"I had a panic attack. I just stood there trembling,\" he said. The room was freezing, and the new detainees were not given blankets for the first two days, he added.</p>\n    <p>\"I was wearing short sleeves, so I put my arms inside my clothes and wrapped myself in a towel to try to stay warm at night,\" he said. \"The worst part was the water. It smelt like sewage. We drank as little as possible.\"</p>\n    <p>The bunk beds were all taken, Chul-yong said, by the time he arrived, leaving him and others to find any empty spot to rest, even an empty desk where they could put their head down.</p>\n    <p>\"We tried to sleep anywhere, really. It was really cold. There were people who found packaged bread, heated it up in the microwave, hugging it throughout the night.\"</p>\n    <p>For the first few days, Youngjin had no idea how long he would be held for. He feared it might be months. Only after some of the workers were able to meet lawyers and consular staff, did they realise their government was working with the US authorities to get them released.</p>\n    <p>\"Even the US side feels it may have gone a bit too far,\" South Korea's chief trade negotiator told reporters after returning from the US. Seoul says it is now investigating potential human rights violations during the raid by US authorities.</p>\n    <p>Trump acknowledged the need to have specialists from overseas train up US workers, and according to South Korean officials, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has expressed his \"deep regrets\" over the incident.</p>\n    <p>Still, it has shaken relations between the US and South Korea, usually close allies, especially since it came hard on the heels of a trade deal in which South Korean companies pledged to invest $350bn in the US.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d902/live/d5d88780-92ec-11f0-9ef6-83faefc563e4.jpg.webp\" alt=\"BBC/ Hosu Lee Youngjin shows a red band that they put on before he was arrested, indicated he had to be checked\"/>\n    <p>Mr Kim believed his work was permitted by his B-1 visa - and argued it made no sense for the authorities to detain hundreds of people without clarifying their roles in the factory.</p>\n    <p>Younjin, who was in the US on a 90-day visa waiver programme, is adamant he did nothing illegal. \"I only attended meetings and gave training presentations,\" he said, explaining this was within the scope of the waiver. \"My trust in the US has been deeply shaken. I don't think it's a trustworthy partner for South Korea.\"</p>\n    <p>Although back with his family, the engineer is still struggling to process what happened to him. When he saw them at the airport after arriving home on Friday night, he said he smiled and hugged them, but felt nothing.</p>\n    <p>\"It was like I was hollow inside. It wasn't until my mum cooked me dinner that night that it really hit me, and I cried for the first time.\"</p>\n    <p>And he only leaves the house for short outings. \"When I'm outside, if I smell something similar to the prison, I start trembling and get short of breath, so I don't go outside for long now,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Chul-yong says he, too, has been struggling with the experience. \"We all came out of the arrival gate smiling, but now that I think of it, I was close to tears,\" he says, recalling his return home last week. \"Saying this makes me tear up.\"</p>\n    <p>And seeing himself in news reports on TV has not been easy. \"You couldn't see my face, but you could recognise my body. So my family and friends all knew that it was me.\"</p>\n    <p>He thinks most of the workers have \"had enough\" and may not return. But he says he has no choice.</p>\n    <p>\"This is what I do. I've been doing this for 30 years. I've put my life into this work,\" he adds.</p>\n    <p>\"If I can't do this, what can I do?

    "body": "<p>John Swinney and Donald Trump remain at odds on a whole range of issues - but something has fundamentally changed in their relationship.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Scotland's first minister will don his sharpest evening wear to attend a State banquet at Windsor Castle in honour of the US president.</p>\n<p>Six months ago there seemed little chance that the SNP leader would have anything to do with President Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n<p>In early March, Swinney said it was \"unthinkable\" the trip should go ahead following the Oval Office ambush of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>\n<p>Trump has since lifted a pause on the US supply of weapons to Ukraine but his commitment to its defence against Russia remains in question.</p>\n<p>Swinney also criticised the Trump plan to take over Gaza and develop the coastline into a Riviera of the Middle East style resort, saying it would amount to \"ethnic cleansing\".</p>\n<p>But now he is set to join Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at the Windsor banquet.</p>\n<h2>Why has John Swinney's approach changed?</h2>\n<p>The event has been boycotted by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey in protest over US policy on Gaza, and Scottish Greens co-leader Ross Greer has urged Swinney to join the boycott.</p>\n<p>Swinney will be the only devolved first minister to attend. The Northern Ireland executive is being represented by DUP deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly.</p>\n<p>The Labour first minister of Wales, Eluned Morgan, has politely declined the King's invitation in order to lead tributes to a deceased political colleague in Cardiff.</p>\n<p>Reform UK's Nigel Farage has not been invited.</p>\n<p>So what has changed to alter John Swinney's approach?</p>\n<p>That was a question I put to him at a news conference in Edinburgh last week and his answer was fairly opaque.</p>\n<p>\"We've just got to get on with the world as we see it and as it is in front of us,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He was just off a plane from the United States, where he had been granted extraordinary access to the Oval Office to make the case directly to President Trump for the reduction or removal of US import tariffs or taxes on Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>This is a pragmatic first minister who has clearly decided to engage with the US president where he sees an opportunity to influence his thinking, especially if it could benefit the Scottish economy.</p>\n<p>That does not prevent him from speaking up on issues of concern like Ukraine and Gaza, although he may need to be more diplomatic in how he makes those interventions.</p>\n<p>That is essentially the approach that Sir Keir Starmer has taken and he has managed to secure lower tariffs for UK produce entering the US market than those faced by other countries, including EU member states.</p>\n<p>UK negotiators have been working ahead of the state visit to secure further concessions on trade and Swinney has seized the opportunity to contribute to that effort on behalf of Scotch whisky.</p>\n<p>But given that trade is a UK government responsibility, not one for the Scottish government, how has he managed to get to the heart of the action?</p>\n<p>Donald Trump had a huge fallout with Alex Salmond when he was first minister over the Scottish government's support for offshore wind.</p>\n<p>The pivotal moment in changing relations with the Trumps was a meeting between John Swinney and President Trump's son Eric on Thursday 13 March.</p>\n<p>I remember it because it was kept secret in advance and I bumped into the first minister rushing down a back staircase to leave Holyrood after question time that day.</p>\n<p>He made no reference to where he was going, why he was in a hurry or why he was avoiding the usual route that would take him past a clutch of news reporters hoping to catch a word.</p>\n<p>This meeting was arranged at the request of the Trump Organisation, which has two golf resorts in Scotland at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Both sides described it as a business discussion and insisted that politics were not mentioned, although the lines between those two spheres have become increasingly blurred since President Trump returned to office.</p>\n<h2>Building a new relationship</h2>\n<p>It seems the two most important words spoken at Eric Trump's meeting with the first minister at his official residence in Edinburgh were \"thank you\".</p>\n<p>Swinney thanked the Trump family for their investment in Scotland and the Trump team were taken aback because they said no-one in the Scottish government had previously bothered to say these words.</p>\n<p>A few months before, Eric Trump had called John Swinney \"nasty\" for endorsing Kamala Harris in the US presidential election campaign.</p>\n<p>It seemed this could now be put aside and a new relationship built.</p>\n<p>It may be worth noting that when the Trumps first came to Scotland seeking to build on the protected sand dunes of the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, it was John Swinney who granted them planning permission, overturning local objections.</p>\n<p>He had been their ally in the past and perhaps he could be again.</p>\n<p>There is no suggestion that the Trump business has asked for anything specific from the Scottish government.</p>\n<p>However, it is a matter of record that Scottish ministers awarded public funds to support a golf tournament to be played at Trump International, as the Aberdeenshire business is officially known.</p>\n<p>That was announced in time for Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts in July, which included a dinner with both the prime minister and the first minister in Aberdeenshire.</p>\n<p>Swinney had a breakfast meeting with the president the following morning before attending the opening of a new Trump golf course at which Donald Trump praised him as a \"terrific guy\".</p>\n<p>It was during this visit that Swinney said he took the opportunity to raise concerns about the impact of US tariffs on the whisky industry.</p>\n<p>He had heard the president say on arrival in Scotland that he did not realise that whisky was an issue, even though the UK government insists it was among the items on their trade agenda.</p>\n<p>Swinney suspected steel and pharmaceuticals were higher on the UK's priority list and made a point of pressing the case for whisky with the president.</p>\n<p>He may then have been a little disappointed when Trump played down the extent of their discussion when he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the flight back to America.</p>\n<p>But that was not to be the end of their conversation on whisky.</p>\n<p>The Scottish government followed up through US diplomats and Swinney decided to fly to Washington to lobby further, accepting an invitation to make his case directly to President Trump in the White House.</p>\n<p>He had a 50-minute conversation with the most powerful political leader in the western world.</p>\n<p>None of his predecessors as first minister have been afforded that amount of face time. Labour's Henry McLeish is the only previous holder of the office to have been granted a courtesy call to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>This special access was supported by the then UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, before the extent of his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein brought him down.</p>\n<h2>Relaxing whisky tariffs 'a win-win' deal</h2>\n<p>While Trump's Scottish heritage may have helped get Swinney in the door, the first minister said he did not trade on sentiment but instead presented a potential \"win-win\" business deal to Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The proposal is that by relaxing tariffs on Scotch whisky he would not only ease a burden on Scotland's national drink but also boost demand in Scotland for used bourbon casks from Kentucky.</p>\n<p>A lot of whisky is matured in these second hand barrels and US distillers are working with the Scotch Whisky Association to appeal for a special trading arrangement - zero tariffs on Scotch entering the US and none on bourbon or used casks coming into the UK.</p>\n<p>Swinney's lobbying on this issue could be a political win-win for him too.</p>\n<p>If Trump agrees a deal, Swinney will be able to claim a share of the credit. If that does not happen, Swinney will argue that the UK government failed to bring home a deal that he set up.</p>\n<p>If there is blowback from within the SNP over his efforts to woo Trump that is not yet apparent. One party insider who is very cautious about Trump described Swinney as having played an \"absolute blinder\".</p>\n<p>One former Conservative adviser told me Swinney's approach was \"smart politics\".</p>\n<p>What seems remarkable to me is that the first minister was able to develop this strategy under the noses of UK Labour ministers without any obvious challenge.</p>\n<p>They enabled him to run rings round them.</p>\n<p>The new UK Business Secretary Peter Kyle was in Washington talking tariffs the day before John Swinney, yet his department struggled to produce a statement for days.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the administration was distracted by the reshuffle following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner or the emerging crisis surrounding Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e75d7g49no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This year's celebration saw Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic headline the building's lawn for thousands of people.</p>\n    <p>Fashion's elite, sports stars and wartime leaders have all been entertained here. Even in 1825 when the original site was built, according to Winfield's official website, its primary use was for entertainment.</p>\n    <p>President Donald Trump is spending the first night of his state visit at the 35-room mansion. The Trumps also stayed there in 2019, as did the Bidens and Obamas previously.</p>\n    <p>\"It's not just the home of the ambassador, but it's also a centre of diplomatic hospitality,\" says Stephen Crisp, formerly the property's head gardener, who worked there for 37 years until his retirement last year.</p>\n    <p>One thing Winfield isn't, is a tourist attraction. Located inside Regent's Park, it's exclusive and takes planning to get inside. Friends of Regent's Park previously arranged tours of the grounds - but so far this year the ambassador has not granted permission.</p>\n    <p>From the road outside, the house cannot be seen. It's shrouded in woodland and is very private for central London.</p>\n    <p>\"It's really, really difficult to get in there. I regard it as a feather in my cap that I actually managed to get in,\" says Viv Ward, Friends of Regent's Park's event manager. He calls the house \"magnificent\" and is audibly in awe of the grounds.</p>\n    <p>Tours of Winfield only allow you to see the ground floor, which is basically a \"very posh\" area for receptions, and the gardens. The first floor is home to the personal apartments of the ambassador.</p>\n    <p>As a home and the venue of most American receptions, schedules are tight. \"It wasn't a case of we would like to come on this date and this time. It was just, you will be allowed to come here on this day,\" Mr Ward says.</p>\n    <p>The property boasts the second-largest private garden in central London, says Mr Crisp. It's home to a lawn, paved walkways, sculptures - and there's also space for helicopters to land.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d3b/live/b6891af0-8e4d-11f0-b199-41ee52afc86b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"CHRIS JACKSON/AFP via Getty Images Archive photo from 2019: King Charles and President Trump cheers with two wine glasses\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cf0/live/053218d0-8a63-11f0-b758-393fbf15c843.jpg.webp\" alt=\"MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images A round banquet table laid out for a dinner service with a round flower arrangement of white roses in the centre of the table\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6616/live/ab914410-8a56-11f0-95eb-d1da321bb996.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images A dinner setting with gold cutlery and a place card that reads Mr Trump\"/>\n    <p>Socialite and heir to the Woolworths fortune, Barbara Hutton, sold Winfield to the US government for a mere dollar in 1946 in an offer described by the then-president Harry S Truman as \"most generous and patriotic\".</p>\n    <p>Hutton had bought the house 10 years earlier after it was partly destroyed in a fire. The Crown Estate Commission gave her permission to tear it down and rebuild in the iconic red brick Georgian style that remains today.</p>\n    <p>She named it after her grandfather, Frank Winfield Woolworth, the founder of the Woolworth shopping chain.</p>\n    <p>With World War Two about to erupt and her second marriage not going particularly well, Hutton returned to America with her son in 1939. It would later be revealed this is when she met her next husband - actor Cary Grant - who is said to have stayed at the mansion with her.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/184c/live/f2e48e80-89bb-11f0-98cc-8182b2586301.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bettmann Archive/Getty Images A black and white photo of a woman holding a cigarette in her left hand with a dog on her lap\"/>\n    <p>During the war, Winfield was commandeered by the Royal Air Force balloon barrage unit with officers reportedly playing football in the gardens.</p>\n    <p>Hutton returned to London to see what was left of it at the end of the war - and after the Germans' bombs. She called her lawyer and requested it be handed over to the US government for repairs - and it's been used as the official residence of ambassadors ever since.</p>\n    <p>History is in the walls of Winfield. The original building was called St Dunstan's, and according to Friends of Regent's Park, was used for blind veterans of World War One. A charity of the same name still exists today.</p>\n    <p>Speaking about US presidents, Mr Crisp says: \"At some point they all come, at least once.\" He explains he met Trump and his wife Melania during their previous state visit in 2019, which was \"a little bit surreal\". They dined at the property with Queen Camilla and King Charles III before he ascended to the throne.</p>\n    <p>An iconic image of Mikhail Gorbachev - the last Soviet leader - and US President George W Bush may be one of the most famous moments from the house. The pair held a joint news conference there at the G7 summit in 1991.</p>\n    <p>Politicians have long used it for key moments, including international summits, grand state dinners and bringing together wartime leaders.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d252/live/5ff85170-89c4-11f0-9955-fd3f4ebf7708.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rota/Anwar Hussein/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II stands between Barack and Michelle Obama\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfac/live/77da7a00-8a57-11f0-94f4-77b666520245.jpg.webp\" alt=\"MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images Donald and Melania Trump - in dinner attire - stand on a red carpet awaiting arrivals as a soldier salutes next to them \"/>\n    <p>Security detail for presidential visits is secure information - often never released. But Mr Ward shares a glimpse into the daily routine at the house.</p>\n    <p>\"The security is unbelievable, I mean for example I used to have to send the embassy a list of attendees,\" he adds, saying photo ID had to be shown to the armed presence on the gates of Winfield.</p>\n    <p>And if you want to leave early? An armed officer has to escort you off the premises.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/593c/live/cf807180-8a55-11f0-94f4-77b666520245.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bettmann Archive/Getty Images A black and white photo of men in tuxedos, seated (left to right) are former British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill, Eisenhower, and Prime Minister Harold MacMillan.

Both are wearing suits and ties\"/>\n    <p>Winfield House has hosted many varied events, says Mr Crisp.</p>\n    <p>There have been performances by Take That, Duran Duran, the Foo Fighters, Ed Sheeran and Bastille, he says, sometimes in the garden and sometimes in the house.</p>\n    <p>It's also been home to sporting events with the Duke of Sussex attending an Invictus Games reception there. Michelle Obama got stuck in with a sports day event, even doing the tug of the war alongside some famous spectators.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/698b/live/c3e814a0-8e50-11f0-b199-41ee52afc86b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Geoff Pugh - WPA Pool/Getty Images The back of man's jacket is emblazoned with a Union Jack flag and the words: British Armed Forces.

Former Vogue boss Alexandra Shulman co-hosted a London Fashion Week opening party with the ambassador at the time. A Spice Girl was spotted too.</p>\n    <p>Some of the events would involve \"thousands\" of guests, Mr Crisp says, with the 4 July parties typically gathering 3,000 or 4,000.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e315/live/6e3cf460-89c0-11f0-b31d-8d3b90f8db88.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AB Promotions/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images A woman and man face each other, the woman points two horizontal fingers at him\"/>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16cc/live/54705720-89c0-11f0-b31d-8d3b90f8db88.jpg.webp\" alt=\"David M.

(Disappointing feels like a stretch.) Mr Ward says its driveway is \"rather modest\" compared to the rest of Winfield.</p>\n    <p>\"It's big enough for big limousines but you couldn't get a brigade of guards walking up and things. It's not like the Mall.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Additional reporting: Grace Dean</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0x2vxl7gjo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A criminal investigation is under way.</p>\n    <p>JLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as \"speculation\".</p>\n    <p>But concerns are growing about the impact of the stoppage on the carmaker's extensive supply chain, amid claims <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdjn0lv64ro\">some companies could face bankruptcy</a> without prompt financial support.</p>\n    <p>The shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day.</p>\n    <p>The firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has car plants in Solihull and Halewood, as well as an engine facility in Wolverhampton.</p>\n    <p>It also has large factories in Slovakia and China, as well as a smaller facility in India.</p>\n    <p>But all of the production lines have been at a standstill since 1 September when the hack first came to light.</p>\n    <p>Announcing the latest delay, JLR said: \"We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n    <p>\"We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.\"</p>\n    <p>JLR initially appeared confident that the situation would be resolved quickly. However, it has since become clear that restarting production is not a simple process.</p>\n    <p>The company has admitted some data may have been viewed or stolen by third parties as a result of the cyber attack.</p>\n    <p>By 24 September, three and a half weeks of output will have been lost. Industry insiders say that even once the production lines have restarted, getting back to normal output is likely to take several weeks.</p>\n    <p>Among suppliers, many of whom are small and medium sized businesses, there is growing concern.</p>\n    <p>Several have told the BBC they simply do not have the financial resources to cope with an extended shutdown and industry experts have said bankruptcies are likely, unless some kind of support is provided.</p>\n    <p>Jason Richards, West Midlands regional officer at Unite the union, told the BBC: \"We're already seeing employers having discussions on potential redundancies. People have to pay rent, they have to pay mortgages and if they're not getting any pay, what are they supposed to do?</p>\n    <p>\"We need to have a supply chain into Jaguar Land Rover. I can't emphasise it enough [because] if they turn the tap on and they're expecting the supply chain to be waiting on the subs bench, they won't be there,\" he added.</p>\n    <h2>'Lasting damage'</h2>\n    <p>With hundreds of thousands of people working in the sector, analysts say there is a risk of lasting damage to the country's engineering base.</p>\n    <p>Unite has called for a furlough scheme to be set up, which would use government money to help pay the salaries of people in the sector who are unable to work due to the stoppage.</p>\n    <p>The Commons Business and Trade Committee has also asked the chancellor what plans she has to support vulnerable businesses in the supply chain.</p>\n    <p>JLR itself is understood to have been holding talks with some suppliers about potential support.</p>\n    <p>While a number of suppliers have expressed concern about a lack of information provided to them by JLR, one leading contractor has defended the company.</p>\n    <p>\"We should not forget who is to blame here,\" said David Roberts, chair of Evtec Group.</p>\n    <p>\"All of this is the fault of criminals. JLR is the victim here. We should remember who started this - and it wasn't JLR.\"</p>\n    <p>A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility for the hack. It was also behind a number of high-profile attacks on retailers earlier this year, among them Marks &amp; Spencer and Co-op.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czewlj57e24o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We have discussed that.</p>\n    <p>\"The finishers are going to be more important this season sometimes than the starters.</p>\n    <p>\"We can change the game there, especially with the intensity that we play and teams start to drop off.

    "body": "<p>Watch Trump arrive in New York for his arraignment</p>\n<p>01:18</p>\n<p>What we covered here</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump arrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement and face more than 30 criminal charges in a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.</p>\n<p>Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look to challenge “every potential issue” once the indictment is unsealed.</p>\n<p>Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s office has been investigating Trump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”</p>\n<p>In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment begins</p>\n<p>From CNN's Tierney Sneed</p>\n<p>News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.</p>\n<p>Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.</p>\n<p>However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”</p>\n<p>Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.</p>\n<p>The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.</p>\n<p>The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.</p>\n<p>Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategy</p>\n<p>From CNN's Jeff Zeleny</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward the prosecutor and judge presiding over the case.</p>\n<p>But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well as other investigations he is facing during a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to his legal case and his political campaign, which are now inextricably linked.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney says</p>\n<p>From CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump, gives an interview outside of Trump Tower on March 21 in New York City.</p>\n<p>(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Alina Habba, who represents Donald Trump in several civil matters, spent time with the former president in New York today and said, “He’s in good spirits. Honestly, he’s as he normally would be. He’s ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>Habba — appearing on on Fox News’ “Jesse Watters” — was asked about the “game plan” for Trump’s appearance in court in Manhattan Tuesday and said, “It’s all mapped out.”</p>\n<p>She added, “Barring any surprises, I think that it should be smooth. We’re trying to coordinate and cooperate with everybody to make sure that there are no problems.”</p>\n<p>On whether Trump can get a fair trial in Manhattan, Habba said, “No, no. I think it’s very difficult. I’d like to have faith in this state, but I’ve been practicing for him now for a couple years and gone to court in New York for a few years, and I can tell you, it’s not the same as representing anybody else.”</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>The former president met with attorneys at Trump Tower on the eve of his arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Kristen Holmes</p>\n<p>From left to right: Susan Necheles, Todd Blanche and Joe Tacopina.</p>\n<p>(Reuters/Getty Images)</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump met with his attorneys Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina at Trump Tower after arriving in New York City Monday, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the newest addition to Trump’s New York legal team, Todd Blanche, attended the meeting.</p>\n<p>Trump is expected to be arraigned Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Link Copied!</p>\n<p>Photos: Trump arrives in New York City a day before his expected arraignment</p>\n<p>From CNN's Photo Desk</p>\n<p>Former President Donald Trump has landed in New York’s La Guardia Airport ahead of his expected Tuesday arraignment in a Manhattan courthouse.</p>\n<p>History was made Thursday when he was indicted by a New York grand jury.

    "body": "<p>Robert Redford, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1dqe9ey0kgo\">who has died at the age of 89</a>, appeared in more than 50 Hollywood films, won an Oscar as a director, and became a champion of independent film-makers, founding the annual Sundance Film Festival to showcase their work.</p>\n<p>Success meant he could pick and choose his projects, with many chiming with his politically liberal views. And he campaigned on environmental issues and for the rights of Native Americans.</p>\n<p>His all-American good looks couldn't be ignored: Redford was once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\".</p>\n<p>Another critic said he had \"a fluid physical grace and an inner radiance that sometimes makes it seem as if he's lit from within\".</p>\n<p>But overall, Redford thought his beauty was more of a hindrance than a help to his career - and said karma had brought tragedy in his family life to punish him for his physical good fortune.</p>\n<p>Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, on 18 August 1936 - the son of a milkman who later became an accountant with Standard Oil.</p>\n<p>At school, he became part of a street gang and was arrested for \"borrowing an automobile that had stolen jewellery in its trunk\".</p>\n<p>He won a scholarship to the University of Colorado thanks to his prowess at baseball, but was thrown out after 18 months for drunkenness. At the same time, his mother died - aged just 40.</p>\n<p>Stricken with grief, he drifted for a while, finding work in the Californian oilfields - before travelling to Paris and Florence, where he studied art.</p>\n<p>His sojourn in Europe encouraged him to take a fresh approach to the United States: \"I began to look at my country from another point of view,\" he later said.</p>\n<p>Returning home, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Art with ambitions to become a theatrical designer - but quickly switched to acting.</p>\n<p>Like many actors in late 1950s New York, he picked up a number of small roles on stage and television, including parts in popular series such as The Untouchables, Perry Mason and Dr Kildare.</p>\n<p>His big-screen debut came in 1960 with a minor role in Tall Story, where he found himself working alongside Jane Fonda.</p>\n<p>It was not an auspicious start to his film career. The film flopped - with Time magazine opining that \"nothing can save this picture\".</p>\n<p>However, it did mark the beginning of a lifetime's friendship with Fonda, who later admitted to falling in love with him each time they worked together.</p>\n<p>\"There was always a mystery because he didn't reveal anything. He's got an aura about him,\" she said.</p>\n<p>His first major stage success was as pompous lawyer Paul Bratter in Neil Simon's romantic comedy Barefoot in the Park. It was a role he would reprise in the 1967 film version, opposite Fonda.</p>\n<p>In 1965, he picked up a Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer for his role in the film Inside Daisy Clover with Natalie Wood.</p>\n<p>But he was turned down for the part of Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate because director Mike Nichols felt he was too good-looking - which made Redford wary of being stereotyped by his appearance.</p>\n<p>Global fame came in 1969 with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</p>\n<p>The 33-year-old's portrayal of the laidback Kid, in contrast to Paul Newman's fast-talking Butch, proved to be one of Hollywood's great partnerships.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Redford nearly missed out on the part after one studio executive said: \"He's just another Hollywood blond. Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you'll hit six like him.\"</p>\n<p>The studio did everything it could to avoid hiring Redford, until Newman - a huge established star - stepped in and insisted.</p>\n<p>The two actors found they shared a love of theatre, and remained firm friends until Newman's death in 2008.</p>\n<p>\"We'd play tricks on each other,\" Redford said of his relationship with Newman. \"The more sophisticated the joke the better.\"</p>\n<p>In 1973, their natural on-screen chemistry saw them team up again in The Sting.</p>\n<p>Redford was Oscar-nominated for his role as Johnny Hooker, a small-time grifter who joins forces with Newman's character to swindle a vicious crime boss.</p>\n<p>The film, with its distinctive ragtime soundtrack, eventually won seven Academy Awards including best picture - although Redford was beaten to the best actor award by Jack Lemmon.</p>\n<p>It was the only time Redford was ever nominated in the best actor category at the Oscars, although he would later win as a director - and received an honorary Oscar in 2002.</p>\n<p>Redford's acting roles were prolific throughout the 70s, although there were mixed reviews for his turn as the enigmatic Gatsby in The Great Gatsby, and he was overshadowed by Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were.</p>\n<p>But in 1974, Redford bought the film rights to All the President's Men, an account of the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - the two Washington Post reporters who uncovered it.</p>\n<p>\"The Washington Post were very nervous about us - that this was Hollywood and it could hurt them,\" he recalled.</p>\n<p>Released in 1976, with Redford playing Woodward alongside Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, the film was a critical success, winning four Oscars - including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Jason Robards.</p>\n<p>Four years on, and Redford made his directorial debut with 1980's Ordinary People, a study of the collapse of a middle-class family after the death of one of their sons. It won him his first and only Oscar.</p>\n<p>With recognition came wealth.</p>\n<p>Redford used much of his earnings to buy a ski resort in Utah, his wife Lola's home state, which he renamed Sundance after one of his most famous roles.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, he founded the Sundance Institute to provide creative and financial support to independent film-makers. He went on to become chairman of the Utah/US Film Festival, later renamed the Sundance Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Over time, the festival became a key event in the film calendar, showcasing the work of many directors who went on to become household names, including Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh.</p>\n<p>In acting terms, there were hits and misses over the last two decades of the 20th Century. Prison drama Brubaker was a commercial and critical success, and there was a positive reception for popular dramas The Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal.</p>\n<p>Out of Africa won a fistful of awards, but Havana was badly received and lost money at the box office.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, Redford continued to direct, including A River Runs Through It - which gave a career boost to a fledgling Brad Pitt - and The Legend of Bagger Vance, the last film to feature Jack Lemmon.</p>\n<p>There was a muted reception for Lions for Lambs, which saw him reunited with Out of Africa's Meryl Streep. There was high praise, however, for his role in the groundbreaking All is Lost - about an elderly yachtsman alone on his damaged boat in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>\"There's no dialogue, none at all. And I'm the only actor on screen in the whole movie,\" Redford said. Many critics described his performance as the best of his career.</p>\n<p>He also starred as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Alexander Pierce in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film far removed from his usual fare.</p>\n<p>\"I like the idea of stepping into new territory,\" he told the LA Times, in 2013. \"This is the kind of film I would love to have seen as a kid.\"</p>\n<p>Away from the studio, Redford became a prominent advocate for the environment. \"Ours is a sick planet because of our behaviour on it,\" he said in a 2014 interview.</p>\n<p>Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, and the couple had four children.</p>\n<p>Their youngest, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome aged two months.</p>\n<p>In interviews, Redford said he believed that karma had punished him for possessing sexual magnetism and leading the hedonistic life of an actor.</p>\n<p>\"It felt like retribution,\" he says. \"I always had this thing that death was on my shoulder, 24/7. My dogs, as a kid. My mum. My firstborn.\"</p>\n<p>The couple divorced in 1985, and Redford had lengthy romances with Brazilian actress Sonia Braga and costume assistant Kathy O'Rear. He married Sibylle Szaggars - a German-born artist - in 2009.</p>\n<p>In 2020, his son, David, died in his fifties from complications of bile duct cancer. He had been ill since birth and had had two liver transplants.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Redford announced his retirement from acting soon after his cameo in Avengers: Endgame. But he found it hard to leave the limelight.</p>\n<p>Approaching the age of 90, he reversed his decision a few years later - to appear in several episodes of Dark Winds, the story of two Navajo police officers who try to solve a double murder.</p>\n<p>Redford often shunned the Hollywood limelight, preferring to plough his own furrow.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckke5522r23o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It says that Israel has breached the Genocide Convention that was passed in 1948 by the newly established United Nations. The word genocide, and the convention that defined it as a crime, were directly inspired by the genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany.</p>\n    <p>Israel denies all allegations that its conduct in Gaza has broken the treaties and conventions that make up the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It justifies its actions as self-defence, in protection of its citizens and to force the release of the hostages taken by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 7 October 2023, around 20 of whom are believed still to be alive.</p>\n    <p>The Israelis have dismissed the report as antisemitic lies inspired by Hamas. It was compiled by a commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Israel and the US are boycotting the Council, which both countries say is biased against them.</p>\n    <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">findings of the report</a> will feed into the growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct, which is also coming from Israel's traditional western allies as well as the Gulf Arab monarchies that normalised relations with Israel in the Abraham Accords.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2540/live/176a43c0-92c8-11f0-a03a-79264f13f66e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A line of people walk down a dirt road, surrounded on each side by tall piles of destroyed buildings. \"/>\n    <p>Next week at the UN General Assembly in New York, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada and others are due to join the majority of UN members by recognising the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state.</p>\n    <p>The move will be more than symbolic. It will change the debate about the future of the conflict that began more than a century ago when Zionist Jews from Europe came to settle in Palestine. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has condemned recognition as antisemitic, and a reward for Hamas terrorism.</p>\n    <p>He says the Palestinians will never have independence in any part of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as a Palestinian state would put Israelis in danger. Israeli religious nationalists believe the land was granted to the Jewish people alone by God.</p>\n    <p>Genocide is defined in the 1948 convention, as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group – in this case, Palestinians in Gaza.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7746/live/2471d600-92c8-11f0-a03a-79264f13f66e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A bustling crowd of crying children hold out pots to be filled with food. \"/>\n    <p>The report details actions against Palestinians inside Gaza and in jails inside Israel.</p>\n    <p>Among a long list of accusations is Israeli targeting of civilians that it has a legal obligation to protect, and the imposition of \"inhumane conditions causing the death of Palestinians, including the deprivation of food, water and medicines\". That is a reference to the blockade that has produced a famine as well as widespread starvation, according to the IPC, the international body that assesses food emergencies.</p>\n    <p>The new UN report also details forced displacement, currently happening in Gaza City after the Israeli military, the IDF, ordered all civilians there to move south. Around one million people are believed to be affected. Israel's offensive is gathering pace, with air strikes and the destruction of many buildings, including high rises that are symbols of Gaza City, which the IDF calls Hamas \"terror towers\".</p>\n    <p>The report also says that Israel has imposed \"measures intended to prevent births\". That refers to an attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic that reportedly destroyed around 4000 embryos and 1000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.</p>\n    <p>As well as the results of military action, the UN report singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e6d0/live/5ffe8fe0-92c0-11f0-a44e-f5956a270ddc.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Netanyahu, Herzog and Gallant stand aside several others at a ceremony. The expressions are serious, or sombre, and most people are wearing suits or military attire. \"/>\n    <p>They are Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister, who said on 9 October 2023 that Israel was fighting \"human animals\". Like Prime Minister Netanyahu, Gallant already faces an arrest warrant for war crimes from the International Criminal Court.</p>\n    <p>Netanyahu is also accused of incitement by comparing the Gaza war to the story of the Jewish fight against an enemy known as Amalek. In the bible God tells the Jewish people to eliminate all the Amalek men, women and children, as well as their possessions and their animals.</p>\n    <p>The third official singled out is President Isaac Herzog, who in the first week of the war condemned Gaza's Palestinians for not rising up against Hamas. He said on 13 October 2023 that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\".</p>\n    <p>Legally, it is hard to prove the crime of genocide. The people who framed the Genocide Convention, and interpretations made by the ICJ in more recent cases deliberately set a high legal bar.</p>\n    <p>At the International Court of Justice in The Hague, South Africa has brought a case that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians. It will take several years for the case to be adjudicated.</p>\n    <p>But with the war in Gaza continuing and perhaps escalating further with the current Israeli offensive, the UN report is going to deepen international divisions about the war.</p>\n    <p>On one side are countries who demand an immediate end to the killing and destruction in Gaza, and condemn the famine caused by Israel's siege. They include the UK and France.</p>\n    <p>On the other are Israel, and the United States. The administration of President Donald Trump continues to provide vital military aid and diplomatic cover without which the Israelis would struggle to continue the war in Gaza and its bombing campaigns elsewhere in the Middle East.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4rxjppl8o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

She is smiling wearing a black t-shirt with the polished wooden floor and a large mirror of the studio in soft focus in the background.\"/>\n    <p>At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.</p>\n    <p>Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo\">a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April</a>, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.</p>\n    <p>Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home.</p>\n    <p>\"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"</p>\n    <p>Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.</p>\n    <p>The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.</p>\n    <p>Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.</p>\n    <p>The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet.</p>\n    <p>The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.</p>\n    <p>It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.</p>\n    <p>That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.</p>\n    <p>\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.</p>\n    <p>Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending.</p>\n    <p>And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head. She is wearing a black t-shirt and is standng in a dance studio. In the background there is a window with curtains on the left and a white door at the back.\"/>\n    <p>Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now.</p>\n    <p>That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.</p>\n    <p>As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.</p>\n    <p>The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".</p>\n    <p>So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation.</p>\n    <p>Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that.</p>\n    <p>Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.</p>\n    <p>The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4gnk7g228o\">the row over the winter fuel payment</a>, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.</p>\n    <p>That is not just the case with current retirees.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.</p>\n    <p>Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.</p>\n    <p>There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.</p>\n    <p>No-one said getting older was easy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Later on Tuesday, he ordered the deadline extended again, until 16 December.</p>\n    <p>The US president said a buyer will be announced soon.</p>\n    <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that under a deal being negotiated between the US and China, TikTok's U.S. business would be controlled by an investor consortium that would include tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n    <p>In a new US entity created under the deal, US investors would hold a roughly 80% stake and Americans would dominate the board, with one member selected by the US government, according to the Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter.</p>\n    <p>US users, meanwhile, would move to a new app, currently in the testing phase, that will have content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.

If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy.\"</p>\n    <p>But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: \"AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them.</p>\n    <p>\"Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines,\" she said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmek723dz9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Musk's language was abhorrent, says home secretary</h1>\n    <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said language used by Elon Musk when addressing a rally on Saturday was \"abhorrent\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking over a video link, the tech billionaire criticised \"uncontrolled migration\", later adding: \"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.\"</p>\n    <p>He also said there had to be \"a change of government in Britain\" and that there should be a \"dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held\".</p>\n    <p>Responding to his comments, Mahmood said: \"Whether you're a hostile state or a hostile billionaire, no-one gets to mess with British democracy.\"</p>\n    <p>She added that the \"vast majority\" of people would react to Musk's words with \"a shake of the head\".</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also criticised Musk, telling the BBC: \"He doesn't use language sensibly, he is deeply irresponsible, deeply dangerous.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, Sir Ed had said British democracy was \"too precious to be a plaything for foreign tech barons\" adding: \"Elon Musk doesn't care about the British people or our rights. He only cares about himself and his ego.\"</p>\n    <p>Musk said Sir Ed was \"a craven coward\".</p>\n    <p>Up to 150,000 people attended the \"Unite The Kingdom\" march in London organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson.</p>\n    <p>Around 5,000 joined a counter-protest organised by Stand Up To Racism.</p>\n    <p>Speakers at the main protest expressed anti-immigration sentiments and spoke in favour of freedom of speech.</p>\n    <p>As part of the event, Musk had a conversation with Robinson during which he made his controversial comments.</p>\n    <p>Musk said: \"I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.</p>\n    <p>\"This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives.</p>\n    <p>\"They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business.</p>\n    <p>\"My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comments in Parliament, Mahmood said Britain was \"a tolerant country and yes, we are a diverse country\".</p>\n    <p>\"You can be English with roots that stretched back a thousand years.</p>\n    <p>\"But you can also be English and look like me.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman echoed Mahmood's comments saying: \"The last thing the British people want is this sort of dangerous and inflammatory language which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't think the British people will have any truck with that kind of language and rightly so.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked if the government would review its use of X, the spokesman said government communications were always kept under review.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to rule out awarding contracts to Musk's Tesla company which produces electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002jjr0\">Speaking to Newsnight,</a> Sir Ed said: \"He [Musk] has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v3333rlp7o \">applied to Ofgem</a> for a licence to sell and distribute energy in this country... they are the sorts of things we should look at.\" </p>\n    <p>He also said he would encourage people to leave Musk's social media platform X but that he would be staying, saying the Liberal Democrats were \"calling him out on his own platform\".</p>\n    <p>Taking questions at a press conference on Monday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was also asked about Musk's language.</p>\n    <p>He said there was a \"degree of ambiguity\" in his words but added: \"If the fight that Musk was talking about was about standing up for our rights and free speech, if it was about fighting in elections to overcome the established parties, then that absolutely is the fight that we're in.\"</p>\n    <p>Musk had previously expressed support for Farage and had reportedly been in talks over donating money to the party.</p>\n    <p>However, earlier this year he appeared to cool on the idea, saying Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party.</p>\n    <p>Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Musk's rhetoric was \"the wrong kind of tone\", but added \"we need to deal with some of the fundamentals of what is driving some of these comments\".</p>\n    <p>\"We live in an increasingly divisive society,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"We know that illegal migration is playing a part in that, and we need to have this government get a grip on that.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4rz0pvmno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For each person returned to France, the UK will accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.</p>\n    <p>No one has been removed under the scheme. The first returns to France had been expected to begin from as early as Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>Over the last fortnight, some migrants being held in immigration removal centres, received letters that said they would be put on a scheduled Air France flight departing from Heathrow Airport for Paris at 9am this morning.</p>\n    <p>However, a number of sources told the BBC that some of the potential passengers had been told their departure would be deferred as further representations about their cases were made.</p>\n    <p>Asked by reporters before the High Court ruling if the scheme was a \"shambles\", a government spokesperson said \"no\".</p>\n    <p>They added that the government was \"confident in the legal basis for this pilot, we've taken steps to ensure it's compliant with domestic and international law, as with any policy, we're prepared to respond to any legal scrutiny that occurs\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dqe2443l1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

So, we'll talk to them.\"</p>\n    <p>His comments will be welcomed by Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, who said that tariff relief for British steel is being negotiated.</p>\n    <p>Senior government sources insist there \"remains a path to zero\".</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is \"no mere pageant\" and warned the government that \"we can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past\".</p>\n    <p>An agreement to reduce the tariffs to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July.</p>\n    <p>At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as \"devastating\".</p>\n    <p>However, industry sources told the BBC on Tuesday that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%.</p>\n    <p>One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry. Gareth Stace from UK Steel said the UK should do the same.</p>\n    <p>\"It is even more imperative now that the UK government beefs up its own trade defences to ensure UK steelmakers have a sustainable share of their own market. In these market conditions, the last country to protect their industry will be the first to lose it,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.\"</p>\n    <p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UK's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027.</p>\n    <p>The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress. The government has taken over running Chinese-owned plants in Scunthorpe while Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge collapsed into government control last month.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2gge7p1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He has also been charged with weapons and forgery crimes.</p>\n    <p>And in addition to the New York state criminal proceedings, Mangione also faces federal murder charges, which could lead to the death penalty.</p>\n    <p>Carro rejected the defence team's request to delay the state trial until the conclusion of Mangione's federal trial.</p>\n    <p>During the hearing on Tuesday the judge ruled that trial hearings would begin on 1 December.</p>\n    <p>Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.</p>\n    <p>Thompson, a father of two, was the chief executive of the insurance division of UnitedHealth Group - the largest health insurer in the US.</p>\n    <p>He was in New York City for a meeting when he was shot three times on a busy Manhattan street at around 6:45 a.m. on 4 December.</p>\n    <p>After a five-day manhunt, Mangione was arrested about 300 miles (480km) away, at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania.</p>\n    <p>Police said he left a note criticising companies profiting from the US healthcare system, accusing them of \"corruption and greed\".</p>\n    <p>Outside the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday a handful of Mangione's supporters gathered, some of them holding placards with slogans such as \"Free Luigi\" and \"Innocent until proven guilty\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4y2p8qq5qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They told me there's insufficient evidence to prosecute and he's agreed to pay it back,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Another source involved with the business account said they also understood the ex-MP's agreement to repay funds to be part of the reason the police had closed the investigation.</p>\n    <p>Menzies is not thought to have found employment since he stood down as an MP but the Conservative party confirmed they had given him a hardship loan which is understood to be a five-figure sum.</p>\n    <p>He was first elected in 2010. He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.</p>\n    <p>The money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.</p>\n    <p>In December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.</p>\n    <p>He claimed it was \"a matter of life and death\", she has said, with men holding him in a London flat and refusing to release him unless he paid up.</p>\n    <p>The former MP subsequently denied the men in the flat he labelled \"bad people\" were sex workers.</p>\n    <p>A source close to him instead told The Times that he'd met a man on an online dating website, subsequently gone to the flat of a second man,<strong> </strong>and then been falsely accused of being sick before facing demands for a large sum to pay for cleaning.</p>\n    <p>However, one of the men present at the flat has admitted they had agreed to have sex with Menzies for payment.</p>\n    <p>The man, who is Brazilian, advertises himself as a \"high-class male escort\" and said he had participated in a \"party\" with Menzies and several other escorts.</p>\n    <p>The gathering lasted from Wednesday night to Friday morning, with Menzies absent from a full day of parliamentary work.</p>\n    <p>At its conclusion, Menzies didn't have sufficient funds to pay his bill, which amounted to more than £14,000, according to an account he later gave a close aide.</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian man denied that Menzies had ever been locked in but said there were \"lots of other guys\" and the then-MP \"hadn't paid anyone\".</p>\n    <p>He said he was not aware that Menzies was a politician and when informed of this added that he was \"surprised [b]ut that's his problem, I have nothing to do with it\".</p>\n    <p>\"My contact with him was just for work and ended there,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>As well as telephoning Ms Fieldhouse to demand money from the campaign funds account, Menzies summoned a male aide in his 30s to travel from Manchester to London to meet him at the flat where the \"party\" had taken place.</p>\n    <p>The aide said he was also asked for money, and he and a family member ended up handing over around £1,500.</p>\n    <p>Menzies received a further £6,500 from his office manager. She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.</p>\n    <p>After meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.</p>\n    <p>The aide said that Menzies's office manager gave him £1,000 from the money she had been reimbursed from the local business group's account, but he was still owed £500 which the MP told him he couldn't afford to pay.</p>\n    <p>He alleged that Menzies instead told him he would arrange for a bonus payment to be made through his parliamentary staffing budget.</p>\n    <p>Ipsa, which investigated this claim as an allegation of fraud, found that Menzies had signed off a bonus payment for the aide \"a few days after the incident in question\". This was the only time the aide received a bonus and was described as being for work he had done on a wind farm application.</p>\n    <p>The bonus was for £700, amounting to around £500 after tax.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/w59ykwiqehvh/3YnHUeKx52oK5dWRUMHMqO/e318efae337c17e4a3abb339f7a10826/Closure_report_MM.pdf\">In a report on its investigation published on Tuesday</a>, Ipsa's compliance officer said that he had found the case \"not proven\".</p>\n    <p>He wrote that there was \"evidence of wrongdoing\", including the timing of the payment, but stated that the aide was \"non-committal\" in his statement to the police on whether it was for wind farm work or to reimburse him, and that there was a discrepancy over the amount because he'd claimed to be owed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>Another of Menzies's former staffers also told Ipsa the payment was legitimately for the aide's wind farm work.</p>\n    <p>The aide told the BBC that he had done work on a wind farm, but that was just the excuse Menzies used for the bonus which he told him was actually to reimburse him for the money he had lent him to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They are both smiling.\"/>\n    <p>More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on<strong> </strong>the government's approach to tackling addiction.</p>\n    <p>Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.</p>\n    <p>The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to correct data and it is understood ministers are now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.</p>\n    <p>A former senior civil servant said fewer people might have died if drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.</p>\n    <p>Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.</p>\n    <p>The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.</p>\n    <p>Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.</p>\n    <p>Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.</p>\n    <p>The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.</p>\n    <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the most senior civil servant at the Home Office between 2017 and 2020, told the BBC it was \"quite possible\" that fewer people would have died, if the government's drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It really does matter, first of all the level of attention given to these issues, but then specifically it will affect decisions on how much funding to put into health-related programmes, treatment programmes, or into different bits of the criminal justice system.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.</p>\n    <p>His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Caulfield is the 15th former Tory MP to join the party.</p>\n    <p>The latest defection comes after Danny Kruger, who sat on Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's team as a shadow work and pensions minister, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce802dmgnyro\">became the first sitting Tory MP to defect on Monday</a>.</p>\n    <p>Caulfield told GB News: \"The [Reform] party needs a lot of experience of people who know the system and can talk about this.\"</p>\n    <p>\"If you are Conservative right-minded, then the future is Reform.

That will take it to £9,607 a year, a rise of £431.60 compared with now.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>With inflation forecast to be 4% in September, it is likely Tuesday's average earnings growth figure will be used to set the increase in the state pension<strong> </strong>for the third year in a row.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.</p>\n    <p>The standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying income tax.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027.</p>\n    <p>\"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo\">Linda, a retired hairdresser from Wokingham, told the BBC</a> she was worried her state pension was being pushed towards the tax threshold.</p>\n    <p>\"They're giving it on one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a load of good,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The pensioner said she would struggle to manage on the state pension if she lived on her own.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm lucky that my husband's got a good pension so we have a fairly reasonable lifestyle but if left alone I don't know what would happen to be honest.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-25\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p>\n    <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p>\n    <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p>\n    <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p>\n    <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p>\n    <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p>\n    <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p>\n    <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p>\n    <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p>\n    <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p>\n    <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p>\n    <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’. This could well lead to an early-Autumn pullback in equity markets ahead of the next Fed meeting.”</p>\n<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire has suffered a blow from ratings agency Fitch overnight.</p>\n<p>Fitch has downgraded INEOS Group to ‘BB-’, with a negative outlook, down from BB. That’s a one-notch fall, to the 13th place on Fitch’s scale of credit worthiness, and still leaves Ineos ranked as ‘non-investment grade’.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision, Fitch points out that Ineos is increasingly highly leveraged, due to the “weak chemical market” and high spending on a new ethane cracker in the Port of Antwerp.</p>\n<p>Fitch also predicts that Ineos’s revenue to grow by 2% on average in 2025-2029, after growing 9% in 2024.</p>\n<p>A lower credit rating implies a higher risk of default, or debt restructuring, and can result in higher borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>A dried sunflower field in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian</p>\n<p>Last summer’s extremely hot weather was not great for the European and Ukrainian sunflower crop.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian and European sunflower oil prices have jumped, Bloomberg reports, as forecasters expect low yields in the country and limited production across the continent.</p>\n<p>That’s because the hot, dry summer hampered crop development.</p>\n<p>There are forecasts that Europe could see its worst sunflower harvest in a decade, while harvesting in Ukraine is slow following a drought this year.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, sunflower yields are expected to fall below the five-year average “largely due to the drought in the south, where most sunflower cultivation takes place,” the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a report.</p>\n<p>Europe is facing similar challenges, with top producer France expecting output to drop 15% below the five-year average, according to figures from the French agriculture ministry.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, retail sales were stronger than expected last month – which might deter the Federal Reserve from a surprisingly hefty interest rate cut tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Spending at retail and food services sites jumped by 0.6% month-on-month in August, and were 5% higher than in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Economists had expected a smaller rise, of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>It’s an encouraging sign for US economic growth, but could also encourage Fed policymakers to vote for a quarter-point cut to interest rates, rather than a larger, half-point cut.</p>\n<p>U.S. retail sales stronger than expected.

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <h2>What is the triple lock?</h2>\n    <p>The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">2.5%.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How many people get the state pension?</h2>\n    <p>There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.</p>\n    <p>People born after those dates claim the new state pension.</p>\n    <p>The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.</p>\n    <h2>What is the rise from next April?</h2>\n    <p>It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.</p>\n    <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">annual growth in earnings was 4.7%</a> for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.</p>\n    <p>The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">It was 3.8% in July</a> and is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.</p>\n    <p>The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.</p>\n    <h2>Is the triple lock popular?</h2>\n    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.</p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/uk-public-finances-obr-national-debt-gdp\">cost about three times more than initially expected</a> and suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.</p>\n    <p>Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.</p>\n    <p>Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.</p>\n    <h2>Could the triple lock be ditched?</h2>\n    <p>The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.</p>\n    <p>The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.</p>\n    <p>“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”</p>\n    <p>He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.</p>\n    <p>Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.</p>\n    <p>“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.</p>\n    <p>“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n    <p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n    <p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n    <p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n    <p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n    <p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners,” he said. “It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n    <p>The latest figures are expected to translate into an annual rise worth more than £500 for those on the new state pension, which would increase from £230.25 a week to £241.05 a week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 a week to £184.75.</p>\n    <p>Successive governments have committed to the triple lock since it was first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">introduced by George Osborne in 2010</a>, despite criticism that protecting pensioner incomes comes with a costly price tag for the public purse and risks fuelling intergenerational inequalities.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that state pension costs will rise from about 5% of GDP now to about 8% by the 2070s. Half of the increase is driven by the triple lock, at a time of rising pressure on other areas of spending and social care.</p>\n    <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called for the policy to be scrapped. Heidi Karjalainen, a senior research economist at the thinktank, said: “The triple lock has so far been much costlier than initially expected, and it creates a lot of uncertainty in terms of future spending.</p>\n    <p>“If the economy is doing well then it won’t cost more than increasing the state pension in line with average earnings growth, whereas in volatile periods it can become very costly – as we have seen in the last decade and a half.”</p>\n    <p>It comes as official figures showed the UK’s jobs market has continued to cool, amid a slowdown in annual pay growth and rising redundancies.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said annual growth in regular earnings excluding bonuses slowed to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the three months to June, matching the forecasts of City economists.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The official unemployment rate was unchanged on the previous month in July, at 4.7%, the highest level in four years.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have complained since Reeves’s first autumn budget that her £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a> and 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” would force them to cut jobs and raise prices for consumers.</p>\n    <p>Economists said there was clear evidence of the jobs market cooling. Separate figures from HMRC showed a decline in the number of workers on company payrolls of 8,000, matching City forecasts.</p>\n    <p>After taking account of inflation, annual growth in regular pay was 1.2% in the three months to July, down from 1.5%.</p>\n    <p>Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget. However, business leaders have warned a weaker growth outlook will make it harder for her to raise taxes without further harming the economy.</p>\n    <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. “[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p>\n    <p>Strong wage growth has caused a headache for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> by stoking inflationary pressures, putting further interest rate cuts at risk after four reductions in the past year. However, a deeper slowdown in the jobs market could show the economy is deteriorating, supporting faster rate cuts.</p>\n    <p>The Bank is expected to keep its base rate unchanged at 4% at its next policy meeting on Thursday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The incident made him reconsider the years he had spent reporting on the lives cut short by gun violence — and the stress it had put on his body.</p>\n    <p>\"For the first time really, I had to look deep and engage with what was truly bearing down on my heart,\" he says. \"And for me that had been more than a decade of telling stories of Black death and survival.\"</p>\n    <p>As a reporter in Trenton, Philadelphia and New Orleans, Lee covered the deaths of young men who looked like him. The victims were \"wearing my same sneakers, same haircut,\" he says. \"And you have to wrestle with seeing yourself in some ways, repeatedly gunned down, your body repeatedly falling. Tears for your death over and over and again.\"</p>\n    <p>Lee's new memoir, <i>A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America</i>, is part history, and part personal turning point. He traces the bloody history Black Americans have with firearms, recalls gun violence in his own youth and follows his ancestors' path back to Ghana. </p>\n    <p>The book reads like a plea for people to see the humanity of those lost to gun violence — and for this country to care enough to act.</p>\n    <p>\"We have an opportunity and we still have this opportunity to be the great nation that we've professed,\" Lee says. \"I'm not a policy maker. I don't profess to be an expert in gun policy. But what I do believe is that until we break our lust for these guns, nothing will change.\"</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1650x2550+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F66%2F8ac03d97466dac0623471ca1c01f%2F9781250098016.jpg\" alt=\"A Thousand Ways to Die: The True Cost of Violence on Black Life in America, Trymaine Lee\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On President Trump's comments about the violence in majority-Black cities</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Hearing the president talk about Chicago and Baltimore and other cities, and he goes on to talk about how people in these communities were \"<a href=\"https://x.com/barrie4council/status/1963252762944143506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1963252762944143506%7Ctwgr%5E2e3b618ba1118b0fcf9919e8b3992e510e09ea24%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theroot.com%2Fprofessor-why-trumps-born-to-be-criminals-comment-shou-2000060818\">born to be criminal[s</a>].\" The violence is innate, right? There's something in these people that makes them inherently violent, and the gun is just their tool. </p>\n    <p>But I think one of the biggest things that people miss or don't fully understand is that there is a direct pipeline from a slew of places with super lax gun laws that are poured right into Chicago. And that every one of these guns starts legally. And so along the pipeline, from the factory to the wholesale market, to the retail market, to stores, to gun shows, there are all these places where guns are siphoned off by the so-called good guys with guns. And so while there is violence in Chicago and there is criminality in Chicago, there's criminality that happens long before then to allow these guns to pour into these cities in ecosystems and environments already [twisted] and bound by so much systemic violence and so much lack and so much hunger, and so much trauma that folks are carrying.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On speaking to the mothers of Black men and boys who were shot and killed</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There was this string of killings, starting with like Trayvon Martin, and I got close enough to the families where they trusted me to tell their stories. In the middle of all the noise, I had a direct line to most of these families. And the look in a mother's eyes in particular who has lost a son to murder or violence, it's like nothing you've ever seen. And I still see those eyes. I've never been able to remove those eyes, right? The pain that you see in them, the ocean of emotion welling up in them. And that no matter what we do, all the humanizing, all of the, you know, making sense of the systems and the police and the law and all those things will not bring their child back.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On the importance of showing respect to the victims of violence</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>And the actual process of gathering the information for your report is also tough because you have ask dumb questions. \"What did you see? What did you hear? What was it like the last time you talked to them?\" Questions that are intrusive and at the worst moment in someone's life. And then you're asking for a picture, right? And then, you're over there talking to the police.</p>\n    <p>There's something exploitative by nature: I'm getting so much more out of this than you are. But I always wanted to do it humanely and with great respect. And then you have to take that back to the newsroom. And I literally had an editor once — it was after a shooting and one young person was killed and I think another one was wounded — and he said, \"Oh, that's just a garden-variety killing.\" He described the killing of a young teenager. And mind you, we don't have any context to the situation. ... We don't know how, why, who. We don't anything. But this was so routine that it wasn't worth covering. \"Don't worry about it, it's garden variety.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling with the notion of \"objectivity\"</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The kind of objectivity that we're so often taught in this practice is a blindness. It's like a convenient ignoring of what you actually see. I think what's more appropriate is fairness. And that objectivity in that notion, it's an arm's length from your subject matter. And I never fully believed in that part. I think you have to have your facts right. I think that you have to be fair to people on as many sides as there are. But the notion of objectivity never rang solid for me.</p>\n    <p>What I managed to do, and I hope I continue to do in putting shape to the experiences of people, is going to the people and telling their story as openly and honestly as possible, and painting the picture, and bringing people into their experiences. And even when it's painful, giving a little bit of that pain for everybody to hold. Hold a little of this. If she has to hold some; you have to hold some too.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On tracing a gun from manufacturer to use</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>It was so important, I think, to connect the dots between what's happening in factory towns in Massachusetts where these guns are produced, to the communities where these are so easily bought and sold with very little regulation, in the South mostly, to how they end up in Northern cities like Chicago and Detroit and Philadelphia … to show that there is no disconnect, that it's one long string, and that no one is left off of the broad ripple of impact here.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Sze has had a decades-long career as a poet, with his work often drawing inspiration from philosophy, science and nature. He's also an editor and translator of poetry. Sze will start on Oct. 9, taking over from Ada Limón.</p>\n    <p>The job of the poet laureate is to promote the reading of poetry, and different laureates choose different fields and avenues. In the announcement, Sze says he intends to focus on promoting translated poetry. \"As laureate I feel a great responsibility to promote the ways poetry, especially poetry in translation, can impact our daily lives,\" he wrote in the announcement. \"We live in such a fast-paced world: poetry helps us slow down, deepen our attention, connect and live more fully.\"</p>\n    <p>Sze, born in New York City, is a child of Chinese immigrants. He studied math and science at MIT in 1968. But in a 1998 interview with WHYY's <i>Fresh Air</i>, he said he found himself \"totally bored\" in a classroom and found himself writing all the time instead. So he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to study poetry. Since then, he's written 12 poetry collections, including 2025's <i>Into the Hush</i>.</p>\n    <p>In 2006, Sze became the poet laureate of Santa Fe, where he's lived for a long time. In 2015, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. And in 2019, he won the National Book Award for his collection <i>Sight Lines. </i></p>\n    <p>In the announcement, acting Librarian of Congress Robert R. Newlen praised Sze's poetry as \"distinctly American\" in how he portrayed the Southwest. \"Like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Sze forges something new from a range of traditions and influences — and the result is a poetry that moves freely throughout time and space.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/15/nx-s1-5539826/u-s-poet-laureate-arthur-sze-ada-limo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.</p>\n    <p>However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.</p>\n    <p>His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Green Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

Britain's engineering firm Rolls Royce has been selected to design and build the first in the country.</p>\n    <p>One of the commercial deals set to be signed this week is with US nuclear group X-Energy and the UK's Centrica, which owns British Gas, to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool.</p>\n    <p>Unlike SMRs, which are water-cooled nuclear reactors, advanced modular reactors use gases such as helium as a coolant.</p>\n    <p>There are very few AMRs in the world operating on a commercial basis such as China's HTR-PM reactor.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy wants to build one in the US but, after announcing a partnership with US chemicals and plastics giant Dow in 2021, it has taken until March this year to submit a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project in Texas.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy has said it hopes the reactor at a Dow site could be a blueprint for others and \"manufacturers worldwide could replicate this model\".</p>\n    <p>The government said the Hartlepool deal has the potential to power 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 jobs.</p>\n    <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid, skilled jobs for working people.\"</p>\n    <p>But Greenpeace questioned the UK's focus on nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>\"If these proposals for new reactors scattered around Britain really materialise, the net effect will be higher bills from nuclear's relentlessly spiralling costs, and more CO2 as we wait for the builders to overcome their inevitable construction delays,\" said Dr Douglas Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK.</p>\n    <p>The cost of building large nuclear plants in the UK, such as Sizewell C in Suffolk, has jumped to £38bn from a previous estimate of £20bn. Centrica is one of the key investors in Sizewell C.</p>\n    <p>SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity, but have around a third of the generating output.</p>\n    <p>The modular element means they could be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station.</p>\n    <p>However, the SMR industry is still young, and many different designs are being investigated.</p>\n    <p>Centrica's chief executive Chris O'Shea told the BBC's Today programme that increased costs and delays \"can happen in all large projects\".</p>\n    <p>But he said: \"What you need to do is you need to do more than just one every 20 years in order to get better. So, the more you practice, the better you get which is why small and advanced modular reactors are particularly interesting because they'll be repetitive so you'll produce the same thing over and over again.</p>\n    <p>\"That should bring improvements both in terms of cost and schedule and reliability and cost as well.\"</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he wants the UK to return <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o\">to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\"</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzevzwxwro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Beijing called the allegations \"malicious slander\".</p>\n    <p>The two men were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between 28 December 2021 and 3 February 2023.</p>\n    <p>Speaking outside the Old Bailey following the decision to cease legal proceedings on Monday, Mr Cash said he was \"relieved that justice has been served\".</p>\n    <p>He described the two years since his arrest as a \"nightmare\" and said he hoped \"lessons are learned from this sorry episode\".</p>\n    <p>Prosecutor Tom Little told the the court that his team would offer no evidence against the men and that \"we simply cannot continue to prosecute this case\".</p>\n    <p>The court heard that the Crown Prosecution Service had determined the evidence it had gathered did not meet the threshold to go to trial.<strong> </strong>The pair were due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court from 6 October.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office said it was \"disappointing that they will not face trial given the seriousness of the allegations\".</p>\n    <p>\"We will continue to use the full range of tools and powers to guard against malign activity,\" it added in a statement.</p>\n    <p>That stance was backed by Downing Street, with the prime minister's official spokesman saying the allegations has been \"gravely concerning\", adding: \"It is extremely disappointing that these individuals will not face trial. Any attempt by a foreign power to infiltrate our Parliament or democracy is unacceptable.\"</p>\n    <p>Mr Berry, a teacher from Witney in Oxfordshire, and Mr Cash, of Whitechapel in London, were arrested in March 2023 as part of an investigation that involved counter-terror police.</p>\n    <p>They were accused of collecting information which was \"calculated to be, might be, or were intended to be, directly or indirectly, useful to an enemy\".</p>\n    <p>It had been reported that Mr Cash was involved with Parliament's China Research Group (CRG).</p>\n    <p>He was understood to have had access to several Conservative MPs, reportedly including former security minister Tom Tugendhat and then-foreign affairs committee chairwoman Alicia Kearns.</p>\n    <p>And when Ms Kearns heard that no charges were to be brought, she spoke in the Commons - where her comments are covered by absolute privilege - and said: \"It remains unclear to me why Chris Cash and Christopher Berry cannot be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. The evidence shows a clear line between these two, the United Front Work Department and the politburo, the very top of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n    <p>Defending Mr Cash, Henry Blaxland KC said his client's colleagues at the CRG had \"expressed disbelief\" at his arrest.</p>\n    <p>\"We only hope that he will be able to rebuild his life,\" he added.</p>\n    <p>Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said she was \"quite satisfied\" and entered the two men into not guilty verdicts.</p>\n    <p>When they were charged, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said \"the claim that China is suspected of 'stealing British intelligence' is completely fabricated\".</p>\n    <p>They urged the UK \"to stop anti-China political manipulation and stop putting on such a self-staged political farce\".</p>\n    <p>The government has previously said Chinese spies were targeting UK officials across the political, defence and business sectors as part of an increasingly sophisticated espionage operation.</p>\n    <p>In December, senior judges <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9n4211zn3o\">upheld a decision</a> by MI5 to warn that an alleged Chinese agent, Christine Lee, had infiltrated Parliament and funded a Labour MP, among others.</p>\n    <p>The same month, Yang Tengbo was named as a Chinese businessman who had been banned from the UK for allegedly spying.</p>\n    <p>Both Ms Lee and Mr Yang have denied the accusations made against them.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpd94le39e7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

in Washington, DC on 26 February 2025.\"/>\n    <p>Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure from within the Labour party over his handling of the sacking of the US ambassador Peter Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership, as he prepares to welcome US President Donald Trump on a state visit this week.</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson was sacked last week after a cache of emails reported by Bloomberg showed supportive messages he sent after convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offences.</p>\n    <p>Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be \"gone\" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour.</p>\n    <p>The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's judgement and the wider Downing Street operation.</p>\n    <p>Burgon is a longstanding left-wing critic of Starmer's leadership but his comments nevertheless underline the scale of discontent within Labour.</p>\n    <p>Burgon said: \"I think it's inevitable that if May's elections go as people predict and the opinion polls predict, then I think Starmer will be gone at that time.</p>\n    <p>\"In terms of where we are now, it feels like we're years and years into an unpopular government rather than a year into a government that's just got rid of the Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>\"We're losing votes to the left, we're going to be losing seats to the right.\"</p>\n    <p>His words echoed a weekend of briefing by Labour MPs in public and in private questioning Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>Labour MP Helen Hayes told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour on Sunday that if the sacking were to affect the party's chances in the May 2026 local elections, there would be questions about Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>\"Questions about the nature of the leadership and whether things can continue as they are, but we're not at that point now,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Hayes added that she felt \"devastated\" about Lord Mandelson, but said she believed he should not have been appointed in the first place.</p>\n    <p>With Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month, Downing Street will be hoping to reset the agenda.</p>\n    <p>This week also marks the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgqe26jvnno\">first flight sending asylum seeker deportees to France</a> under the \"one-in-one-out\" deal signed in July.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street sources acknowledge that Sir Keir's upcoming Labour party conference speech must make an impact and say MPs would be \"left in no doubt what he stands for and what drives him\".</p>\n    <p>But this is the second week in a row the prime minister has begun by trying to draw a line under a scandal that led to a high profile exit, and move to a new chapter.</p>\n    <p>The mood in the parliamentary Labour party is bleak, and there are fears the past two weeks may have crystalised MPs' concerns.</p>\n    <p>Government minister Baroness Smith, who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, told the BBC in her experience \"there will always be people in the Labour party worried about us going further and faster\".</p>\n    <p>\"It is difficult at the moment given people's insecurity and concern sometimes for mainstream politicians to cut through.\"</p>\n    <p>She also hit back at Burgon's prediction that Sir Keir will be replaced next year, telling BBC Breakfast the backbencher had never supported the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>She admitted that the sacking of Lord Mandelson as the ambassador to the US was \"not what we would have wanted to happen in the run up to this week\", but said the PM was doing a good job.</p>\n    <p>The BBC reported on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82rdmzr20o\">Sir Keir explicitly asked Mandelson</a> about his links to the paedophile before deciding to appoint him as ambassador to the US.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives have demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment.</p>\n    <p>In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>He said that the scandal had exposed the PM's \"appalling judgement\".</p>\n    <p>\"He ignored warnings about Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, forced through his appointment, and is avoiding scrutiny about what he knew,\" Burghart wrote.</p>\n    <p>The Conservative MP's letter also demanded the release of what he called the \"Mandelson-Epstein Files\" - government correspondence and internal documents related to the pair - and for Sir Keir and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney to give evidence to Parliament.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street have already stressed that the prime minister only knew the contents of the emails on Wednesday evening and acted swiftly, sacking Mandelson within hours.</p>\n    <p>Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has warned Sir Keir's leadership is \"hanging by a thread\" and demanded the prime minister explain Mandelson's appointment in parliament.</p>\n    <p>Labour is facing a polling challenge from Reform UK, as leader Nigel Farage claimed Sir Keir's judgement had left him \"ever more distanced\" from Labour's roots.</p>\n    <graphic

Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p>\n    <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p>\n    <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p>\n    <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p>\n    <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p>\n    <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p>\n    <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p>\n    <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p>\n    <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p>\n    <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/aldis-uk-boss-warns-shoppers-face-higher-food-prices-if-budget-heaps-extra-costs-on-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p>\n    <p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p>\n    <p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants.

The death toll from the “quietly devastating” June heatwave is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/09/europe-june-heatwave-study-climate-breakdown-tripled-death-toll\">tripled in 12 big cities</a> because of planet-heating pollution.</p>\n    <p>While most research into the economic costs of climate breakdown looks at direct impacts, such as destroyed assets or insured losses, the authors of the new study used historical relationships between violent weather and economic output to account for ripple effects, such the limited hours that builders can work during heatwaves or the disruption to commute times after floods damage railways.</p>\n    <p>Stéphane Hallegatte, the chief climate economist at the World Bank, who was not involved in the study, said it confirmed that the wider economic impacts of extreme weather were larger than the direct effects and last longer than people imagine.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve been arguing for a long time to shift our focus from the direct damages from disasters to broader metrics that capture a fuller economic impact, so I’m very happy to see the study doing exactly that,” he said.</p>\n    <p>But he warned that it used “imperfect proxies” to identify extreme weather, which would likely lead to underestimating the full costs. The GVA did not capture the full cost of extreme weather on people and firms, he added, or the benefits of reducing vulnerability.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“Especially when disasters affect poor communities and people, the impact on GVA may be minimal, because these people are poor,” said Hallegatte. “But it does not mean they won’t suffer.”</p>\n    <p>Gert Bijnens, an economist at the National Bank of Belgium, who was not involved in the study, said supply chain disruption was one of the most significant “hidden costs” that usually went uncounted. A <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/doc/ts/publications/wp/wp466en.pdf\">study he coauthored</a> on the costs of the devastating Belgian floods in 2021 found that sales at manufacturing firms far from the disaster fell sharply if they had long-standing suppliers in the flood zones.</p>\n    <p>Ignoring such effects could underestimate damages by as much as 30%, Bijnen said.</p>\n    <p>“Of course, such estimates come with uncertainty as they rely on historical averages and can’t yet fully capture compounding events,” he added. “But the big message is clear: extreme weather is already leaving a sizeable economic footprint, and the indirect effects can be just as damaging as the direct destruction.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/europes-summer-of-extreme-weather-caused-43bn-of-short-term-losses-analysis-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Listen to James read this article </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.</p>\n<p>All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.</p>\n<p>This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.</p>\n<p>There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.</p>\n<p>And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.</p>\n<h2>How Windsor became 'Trumpton'</h2>\n<p>For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.</p>\n<p>Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.</p>\n<p>For Palace officials, attention to detail is all.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.</p>\n<p>It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.</p>\n<p>\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider.</p>\n<p>\"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".</p>\n<p>King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.</p>\n<p>Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.</p>\n<h2>'Pressure to make this massive'</h2>\n<p>So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.</p>\n<p>The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.</p>\n<p>\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.</p>\n<p>The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)</p>\n<p>For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"</p>\n<p>Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"</p>\n<h2>The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests</h2>\n<p>Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"</p>\n<p>Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.</p>\n<p>They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.</p>\n<p>\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"</p>\n<p>For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.</p>\n<h2>Serious business behind the pageantry</h2>\n<p>Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.</p>\n<p>Ministers hope to complete a deal to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yp5qzeer6o\">exclude UK steel</a> and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.</p>\n<p>The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>\n<p>This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".</p>\n<p>All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.</p>\n<p>The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.</p>\n<p>\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.</p>\n<p>\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"</p>\n<p>Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.</p>\n<p>\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"</p>\n<h2>The Mandelson question</h2>\n<p>For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p>The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?</p>\n<p>Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.</p>\n<p>According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.</p>\n<p>It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.</p>\n<p>Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT</p>\n    <p>TikTok’s owner, Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, has faced a Wednesday deadline to find a buyer for the short video site’s US operations, or be banned in the country.</p>\n    <p>Trump has already extended that deadline several times, giving ByteDance more time to agree a deal with an American-backed owner that satisfies both the US and China.</p>\n    <p>Back in July, Trump claimed that the US “pretty much” had a deal on the sale of TikTok.</p>\n    <p>Washington and Beijing appear to have struck a deal on the future of the US operations of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok.</p>\n    <p>JamiesonGreer, the US trade representative, said on Monday that Washington and Beijing have struck a framework agreement on transferring TikTok to US-controlled ownership.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after emerging from negotiations with Chinese officials, Scott Bessent said the deal was coming but declined to reveal the commercial terms.</p>\n    <p>“We have a framework for a TikTok deal,” the treasury secretary told reporters after coming out of high-level talks in Madrid.</p>\n    <p>“We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.”</p>\n    <p>The framework agreement is a breakthrough in the long-running dispute over TikTok’s ownership, which has raised national security concerns in Washington over the app’s Chinese parent company ByteDance. In April 2024, Joe Biden signed legislation that gave ByteDance nine months to sell the platform to a US-approved buyer or face a total ban – a deadline that Donald Trump has repeatedly extended.</p>\n    <p>Trump hinted that a deal had been done, posting on his Truth Social site that a deal had been reached ‘on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.’</p>\n    <p>On the ongoing trade talks with China, Scott Bessent told reporters in Madrid:</p>\n    <p>“We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location.”</p>\n    <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that trade talks between US and China had not concluded, after the meeting in Madrid wrapped up this lunchtime in Europe.</p>\n    <p>Instead, they will go to a fifth round in about a month’s time.</p>\n    <p>The Madrid meeting follows earlier talks in Geneva, London and Stockholm in recent months.</p>\n    <p>“We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon.”</p>\n    <p>He said the details would be ironed out when Trump speaks to China’s Xi on Friday, adding:</p>\n    <p>“We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location.”</p>\n    <p>Trump hints TikTok deal has finally been reached with China</p>\n    <p>Donald Trump has dropped a firm hint that the US and China have reached a deal about the future of TikTok.</p>\n    <p>Posting on Truth Social a few minutes ago, Trump declares that the meeting taking place between officials from the US and China about trade in Madrid had gone “VERY WELL”</p>\n    <p>Trump wrote:</p>\n    <p>The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save.</p>\n    <p>They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT</p>\n    <p>TikTok’s owner, Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, has faced a Wednesday deadline to find a buyer for the short video site’s US operations, or be banned in the country.</p>\n    <p>Trump has already extended that deadline several times, giving ByteDance more time to agree a deal with an American-backed owner that satisfies both the US and China.</p>\n    <p>Back in July, Trump claimed that the US “pretty much” had a deal on the sale of TikTok.</p>\n    <p>Risk assets have shown “remarkable resilience” in the last few months, defying the trade conflict and policy uncertainties, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has pointed out today.</p>\n    <p>In its latest quarterly review, BIS (known as the central bankers’ central bank) says markets have shrugged off trade concerns, and maintained “a risk-on tone”.</p>\n    <p>BIS says:</p>\n    <p>Despite short-lived bouts of volatility triggered by incoming data and political developments, market sentiment remained upbeat, defying mounting challenges, including unease over the longer-run fiscal outlook in several key jurisdictions.</p>\n    <p>BIS also cautions, though, that markets could be too relaxed.</p>\n    <p>Hyun Song Shin, head of the BIS’s monetary and economic department, told reporters that markets are “vulnerable to repricing from bad news,” Bloomberg reports.</p>\n    <p>He warned</p>\n    <p>“This very sanguine assessment seems to be disregarding some of the very real challenges in the real economy.”</p>\n    <p>Donald Trump has proposed that US companies should be relieved from the burden of reporting financial results each quarter.</p>\n    <p>Posting on Truth Social, Trump says:</p>\n    <p>Subject to SEC Approval, Companies and Corporations should no longer be forced to “Report” on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but rather to Report on a “Six (6) Month Basis.” This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.</p>\n    <p>Did you ever hear the statement that, “China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis??? Not good!!!</p>\n    <p>Quarterly reporting does also give investors an up-to-date view of a company’s performance (and gives live-bloggers more to write about, which I’d say is “good!!!”).</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/15/uk-house-prices-drop-tax-budget-rents-financial-markets-business-live-news-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In 2016, as Venezuela's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/27/1031871225/bonus-venezuelas-rise-and-fall\">socioeconomic crisis</a> deepened, Caceres moved to the United States and found a position as a textile designer.</p>\n    <p>\"When I moved here, I was working designing for other people. I wasn't doing anything for myself,\" she said. \"I didn't have time to do anything for myself.\"</p>\n    <p>Worst of all, she had to leave Tobi back in Venezuela. She missed him immensely, and she craved a creative outlet to help her through all the transitions she was going through. So she started a project: Every day, for a whole year, she would draw a different dog. She called the project \"A Dog A Day Keeps the Stress Away,\" and the first dog she drew in January 2018 was, of course, Tobi.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4284x5712+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fba%2Fea1a25754d5d89e48c9345dddf20%2Fandrea-caceres-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\"/>\n    <p>\n                Andrea Cáceres, Tobi and his brother, Charlie, sit amongst the illustrator's pet portraits.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    Courtesy of Andrea Cáceres\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <p>The illustrations took off.

    "body": "<p>US President Donald Trump is going to be greeted with a spectacular royal charm offensive during his state visit this week.</p>\n<p>The aim will be to dazzle and flatter him with the ultimate red-carpet experience, with guards of honour, flypasts, historic carriages, a lavish banquet, pomp and pageantry.</p>\n<p>In return, Sir Keir Starmer will be hoping this gilt-edged reception will help to deliver the UK's message on awkward issues such as Ukraine and trade tariffs.</p>\n<p>And if anyone can get the US president's attention and influence him, surely King Charles III and the Royal Family can.</p>\n<p>But how will King Charles handle his sometimes unpredictable guest in Windsor? Can he be the Trump whisperer?</p>\n<p>\"Trump loves the monarchy and the Royal Family. It's a potential diplomatic ace card for the UK government,\" says Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the modern monarchy at City St George's, University of London.</p>\n<p>This attraction to royalty will give the King a \"rare advantage\" in dealing with Trump, who usually expects to have the upper hand, says Prof Whitelock.</p>\n<p>Sir Anthony Seldon, biographer of the UK's prime ministers, agrees. The King can benefit from Trump's \"palpable enthusiasm\" for the royals, he says.</p>\n<p>\"At the same time, King Charles is in the most delicate of positions. His own known views, on the environment, and standing up for democracy and the rule of law in Europe, are a long way apart from the president's,\" says Sir Anthony.</p>\n<p>\"He will, I am sure, be scrupulously correct and civil,\" he adds. In essence, the King will stick to the script given to him by the UK government.</p>\n<p>The government will certainly hope that this week's royal schmooze-fest will make a positive impression on Trump, creating a feelgood factor for the UK.</p>\n<p>It's an unusual and carefully crafted state visit. There's a crammed schedule squeezed into a day and a half, most of it dedicated to royal spectacles. Windsor is being used like a royal theme park.</p>\n<p>With fears over security and protests, there won't be any cheering crowds and no public procession, like the one recently enjoyed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Instead, it will be helicopters and closed events, including the carriage ride, which will wind its way inside the Windsor estate.</p>\n<p>A YouGov poll over the summer showed <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/07/14/6be72/1\">opinion divided on whether Trump's visit should go ahead</a>, with slightly more wanting it cancelled.</p>\n<p>And the nearest thing to the public that the president will see will be the staff working at the banquet.</p>\n<p>The King will make a speech in honour of the president at the state banquet in St George's Hall, inside Windsor Castle. He's likely to praise the special relationship and talk of the anniversaries of wartime alliances, perhaps mentioning his mother, the late Queen, and Trump's mother, who so admired royalty.</p>\n<p>Every word will have been written in close consultation with the government, anxious to hit the right notes.</p>\n<p>Guests, including many celebrity faces, will dine on a showcase of US and British food, from a menu written in French, with five or six different glasses for each place, in a hall lined with royal portraits and suits of armour.</p>\n<p>Charles has decades of experience at playing host. Whatever his own private thoughts - and he's not exactly going to be signed up to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" message - the King has a strong sense of duty and will work hard to make this visit a success.</p>\n<p>Royal author Robert Hardman suggests they'll stick to safe topics - such as talking about the president's Scottish roots.</p>\n<p>And the royals have, of course, had plenty of visits from people with whom they might not have seen eye-to-eye. Mr Hardman describes how the late Queen Elizabeth II once hid behind a bush rather than bump into Romania's President Caecescu in the palace gardens, during the dictator's state visit in 1978.</p>\n<p>The King is also not alone. The rest of the Royal Family will be deployed to help with the hospitality.</p>\n<p>All eyes will be on Catherine, the Princess of Wales, and the First Lady, Melania Trump, when they visit a nature project involving the Scouts on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Trump is also an admirer of Prince William, praising their \"great, great talk\" in France at the re-opening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral. William and Catherine will be an important part of the ceremonial welcome on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Queen Camilla will show Melania one of the quirkier items in Windsor, a remarkable dolls' house, made a century ago by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. If things get too tough, the miniature wine bottles in the dolls' house have real drink inside.</p>\n<p>While King Charles and Trump might seem contrasting personalities, they're very much known quantities to each other. They're men of the same post-war generation - Trump aged 79 and the King aged 76 - who have overlapped for decades. As far back as the late-1980s, Charles had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.</p>\n<p>After Trump survived an assassination attempt last July,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c51ykzn0739o\"> the King sent him a personal note</a>. They spent time together during Trump's previous state visit in 2019.</p>\n<p>And it's also not just the two heads of state who have crossed paths, but their families.</p>\n<p>Before Trump had taken a run at the White House, his businessman brother Robert, who died in 2020, had been a significant donor to Charles's charities, bringing him to royal dinners in the UK, along with other wealthy US socialites.</p>\n<p>The King's brother, Prince Andrew, had visited Mar-a-Lago in 2000, introducing himself as \"Andrew York\" to guests. Jeffrey Epstein, later convicted as a sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the same party.</p>\n<p>Prince Andrew will be entirely airbrushed out of this week's visit. But for Trump's 2019 visit, he was described as Buckingham Palace's \"secret weapon\", accompanying the president on two of the three days. That was only a matter of months before the Duke of York's notorious Newsnight interview.</p>\n<p>Trump clearly relished meeting the late Queen Elizabeth II and he'll pay his respects to her, laying a wreath on her tomb in St George's Chapel.</p>\n<p>Trump's fascination with the monarchy is at the heart of this state visit. As with much about the president, it's about his personality more than his politics.</p>\n<p>\"I still remember my mother, who is Scottish by birth, sitting in front of the television set to watch Queen Elizabeth's coronation and not budging for an entire day. She was just enthralled by the pomp and circumstance, the whole idea of royalty and glamour,\" Trump recalled in his book The Art of the Deal.</p>\n<p>\"I also remember my father that day, pacing around impatiently. 'For Christ's sake Mary,' he'd say. 'Enough is enough, turn it off.'\"</p>\n<p>It seems to be his mother's voice that he listened to.</p>\n<p>\"A meeting with the Queen of England was the ultimate sign, that he, Trump, had made it in life,\" wrote his former Russia adviser Fiona Hill in her White House memoir.</p>\n<p>For Trump, getting close to a King or Queen seems to have been the ultimate way for an outsider to become an insider.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxxpxe5qko\">Offering him a second state visit </a>has been called \"unprecedented\". And it is very rare, although Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik of Denmark also had two, in 1974 and 2000.</p>\n<p>Since the start of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 1952, there have only been three state visits by US presidents - George W Bush, Barack Obama and Trump - who is the only one who has had two. There have been other presidential trips to the UK, but not fully-fledged state visits.</p>\n<p>The significance of that shouldn't be underestimated and it reflects how much Trump dominates the international news agenda.</p>\n<p>For the UK government, his apparent fandom for the royals creates an opportunity to make its own pitch to Trump.</p>\n<p>It's an important moment for King Charles, who used to be criticised for \"meddling\" in politics. Now he's in the unusual position of being actively encouraged to play a role in diplomatic negotiations. Soft power is being applied to tough times.</p>\n<p>It was the King who embraced Ukraine's President Zelensky after his White House mauling in February. And it was the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78el01zd03o\">King who went to Canada in May to show solidarity</a> when it was under pressure from Trump to become his 51st state.</p>\n<p>Charles appears to have been effective. Former Canadian high commissioner to the UK, Jeremy Kinsman, said the intervention had been \"outstanding\" and Trump seems to have reduced his aggressive rhetoric.</p>\n<p>The King has also received warm support and standing ovations after speeches to the parliaments of France, Italy and Germany. Charles is a bridge-builder in an era when populist politicians are burning them down.</p>\n<p>Yet issues such as protecting Ukraine are personally and deeply held by the King.</p>\n<p>\"I imagine it is an uncomfortable moment for the King,\" adds Mr Kinsman. \"I cannot imagine two men more utterly different in values, purpose, style, and psychology.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5jgdvnll4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Not reducing it would be completely tone deaf to what’s happening in the global bond markets.”</p>\n    <p>Threadneedle Street intervened during the depths of the financial crisis to buy UK government bonds – aiming to crash borrowing costs close to zero – in a programme that was ultimately expanded up to reach £895bn in total.</p>\n    <p>The Bank is now winding down quantitative easing – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – and has shed about £100bn of bonds in the past year through active sales and allowing maturing debts not to be replaced.</p>\n    <p>It still has a portfolio worth about £560bn, having disposed of most of its holdings at a loss.</p>\n    <p>City investors widely expect the Bank to scale back its QT programme to about £70bn for the year ahead. However, this would involve maintaining active sales at current levels because fewer gilts are due to expire over the next 12 months.</p>\n    <p>Sushil Wadhwani, who was on the MPC between 1999 and 2002, called for a halt to active sales entirely amid worries over the impact of QT on the bond market.</p>\n    <p>“On monetary policy grounds, the Bank should switch to passive QT [only allowing maturing debt to expire],” he said. “Irrespective of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/andrew-bailey\">Andrew Bailey</a> says, the 30-year yield has a significant impact on confidence in the UK economy. I have foreign investors bring it up all the time.”</p>\n    <p>Scaling back the Bank’s QT programme could help the chancellor by easing some of the pressure on long-term gilt yields. Such a step would also save the Treasury money because Threadneedle Street has been selling its bonds at a loss.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, said cutting the Bank’s QT programme to about £70bn was sensible because markets expected such a reduction. However, he warned Reeves against banking on any windfall.</p>\n    <p>“The job of the Bank is not to make the chancellor’s life easy. Its job is to control inflation. And a modest winding back on QT would be quite consistent with that.”</p>\n    <p>In a rare piece of upbeat news for the chancellor, a survey by trade body Make UK suggests an upturn in the key manufacturing sector in the third quarter, with output and export orders rising.</p>\n    <p>Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said all the indicators in the survey, carried out by consultancy BDO, had improved.</p>\n    <p>“After a period of considerable uncertainty in global markets, these figures are an encouraging sign that manufacturers’ confidence is improving and, more importantly, being translated into growth and investment.</p>\n    <p>“However, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and with UK and European markets in particular remaining anaemic it wouldn’t take much to knock prospects for further growth.”</p>\n    <p>The IPPR thinktank has estimated that halting active sales – matching the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank – could save the Treasury more than £10bn a year.</p>\n    <p>However, holding on to the bonds would not be cost free, because the Bank earns less interest on its gilt portfolio than it pays out on commercial bank reserves.</p>\n    <p>Last month, the IPPR called on Reeves to raise taxes on the country’s biggest banks amid windfall profits on their reserves parked at Threadneedle Street. Some economists have also called for the Bank to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/04/a-simple-solution-to-rachel-reeves-spending-cuts-stop-subsidising-the-banks\">pay lower rates of interest</a> on some commercial bank reserves.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/bank-of-england-urged-to-slow-bond-selling-plan-to-help-cut-record-uk-borrowing-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Inside was an American flag that had flown over the Capitol — sent as a gesture of appreciation for Xie Xide, the renowned Chinese scientist who had recently died. Xie had played a key role in fostering cultural and scientific exchanges between the two countries.</p><p>Stories like this are almost inconceivable today in both the United States and China, as the tone of their bilateral relations has fundamentally shifted. But in the new book, <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/chinese-encounters-with-america/9780231217194/\"> Chinese Encounters with America: Journeys That Shaped the Future of China</a>, profiles of 12 Chinese individuals remind us of the optimism that once defined the two countries' engagement. This optimism has faded away in recent years. </p><p>The dozen profiles in this edited volume highlight the positive aspects of U.S.-China exchange, which began in earnest after diplomatic relations were established in 1979. These accounts range from academics like Xie Xide, to environmental activists like Ma Tianjie, and diplomats like <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-f3ada042a03faf8523ff08d270e5e051\">Ji Chaozhu</a>, who served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972.</p><p>Today, as the U.S. and China find themselves in a period of intense competition, these stories may be interpreted differently, depending on the reader's own views on the once-popular engagement policy. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of a unique chapter in bilateral relations, however brief it may have been.</p><p>The book's co-editors, Deborah Davis — a leading sociologist on China — and Terry Lautz, author of <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/americans-in-china-9780197512838\"> Americans in China</a>, argue that the book underscores the value of finding common ground. They express concern that both Americans and Chinese are losing sight of their shared interests and the benefits that have come from cooperation.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1875x2850+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2Fea%2F385436a74672a17e60f0bcc1667d%2Famericansinchina-cover.jpg\" alt=\"AmericansInChina Cover.jpg\"/><p>In an email exchange with NPR, the editors sent joint responses to questions about the issues addressed in the book. Here is an edited version of the exchange.</p><p><strong>NPR: You said you were concerned that both Americans and Chinese had lost sight of their shared interests. Why, in your view, did this happen?  </strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz:</strong> China's unexpected arrival as a major economic and military power triggered a downward spiral in the U.S.-China relations. Washington saw China's ascent and its hardline diplomacy as a challenge to the existing world order. Beijing viewed the United States as a threat to its interests, especially the PRC's claim to the island of Taiwan. This new power dynamic undermined the long-held assumption that Sino-American engagement would lead to positive, peaceful change. Instead, it produced a climate of fear and distrust. The aim of our book is to show the benefits of cooperation and mutual understanding despite our differences.</p><p><strong>NPR: In short, how has encountering the U.S. changed these individuals —  and China itself?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>The impact varies over time. Those who returned to an impoverished China during the Cold War faced different challenges and had different motives from those who returned in the 1990s or 2000s when China was more open politically and prosperous. The consequences of their encounters also vary by occupation — from education, dance, and diplomacy to civil society, science, and sports.</p><p>Their life stories are remarkable. For example, Xie Xide, a renowned physicist who received her PhD from MIT in 1951, became the first woman president of a major Chinese research university in 1983. But she also spent years cleaning floors during the Cultural Revolution. Wang Jisi, one of China's most prominent America watchers, spent seven years herding sheep in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution before entering Peking University in 1978. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/news/story?id=3726969\">Lang Ping</a>, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2007/07/04/6647713/pianist-has-passion-for-performing-new-music\">Peng-Peng Gong</a> was trained at the Juilliard School in New York but walked away from a lucrative career as an international concert pianist and returned to China as the resident composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. He calls himself \"a translator in both directions.\"</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2090+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2Ffb%2Fd51a0e21409a9fd0e550410e76cf%2Fgettyimages-53145099.jpg\" alt=\"Lang Ping, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women’s volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China’s team to gold at the 2014 World Championships.\"/><p>\n                Lang Ping, a Chinese sports icon, coached the U.S. women's volleyball team to a silver medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympics, and then led China's team to gold at the 2014 World Championships.\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    China Photos/Getty Images/Getty Images AsiaPac\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p><p><strong/></p><strong>toggle caption</strong><p><strong>NPR: Among the 12 individuals you profiled, whose story resonated with you the most — and why?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>It's difficult to pick only one, but the diplomat and interpreter Ji Chaozhu stands out because his life mirrored the dramatic ups and downs of Chinese politics and U.S.-China relations. The Chinese Communist Party sent his family to New York City when he was a boy and by the time he returned to New China in 1950, after his sophomore year at Harvard, he could barely speak Chinese.</p><p>The Foreign Ministry sent Ji to make English transcripts of the armistice negotiations in Panmunjom during the Korean War. But because of his American background, it took several years before he could join the Party. He was \"sent down\" to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution but reemerged to interpret for Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai during President Nixon's trip in 1972 and accompanied Deng Xiaoping to the United States in 1979. There were times when he could have sought asylum abroad, but he remained patriotic, convinced that the Communist Party was the best choice for his country's future.</p><graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2560x1920+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2018%2F06%2F11%2Fap_7202281627.jpg\" alt=\"President Richard Nixon and China's Premier Chou En-lai pose together at Shanghai Airport before the Nixon departs for the United States on Feb. 28, 1972.\"/><p>\n                Ji Chaozhu (left) served as an interpreter during President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972.

Did this perspective resonate with any of the individuals you wrote about?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>From what we know of their public lives, none of them would say that engagement with the United States was a mistake— for themselves, for China, or China's relations with America. To the contrary, they came back from the U.S. with knowledge and skills that could be used to make China a strong modern nation. And that's exactly what they did. It was a complex process of adapting what they had learned to fit China's needs while working to improve China's understanding of the United States. All of them saw engagement as an opportunity to advance their careers and to enhance China's global status.</p><p><strong>NPR: Your book spans the Cold War, reconciliation, reform, engagement, and ends with globalization and cooperation. If you were to continue, who might you choose to profile in the current climate of rivalry and distrust?</strong></p><p><strong>Davis and Lautz: </strong>We would probably choose someone in science and technology. Take, for example, Abigail Coplin's chapter about Deng Xing Wang, a brilliant plant biologist who grew up in poverty in a farming village in Hunan province. When he left China for graduate study at University of California, Berkeley in 1985, no one could have imagined he would become a chaired professor at Yale University. And no one could have predicted that he would give that up and return to China to start his own company and direct a major research institute. While our governments may see \"American science\" and \"Chinese science\" as separate entities, Deng's story shows that cutting edge research thrives on cooperation as well as competition across national boundaries.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/g-s1-87796/chinese-encounters-with-america-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\"What a week. What a mess.\" A senior Labour MP is not the only one in disbelief at the latest - you couldn't make it up - mishap for this government.</p>\n<p>How Downing Street handled revelations about Lord Mandelson's friendship with the wealthy paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was the first test of the new senior team in No 10.</p>\n<p>The uncharitable view is they flunked it by not acting quickly enough – putting the prime minister's face on the calamity by sending him into the bearpit of Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) with a staunch defence of his man in Washington.</p>\n<p>They knew there were new allegations about his relationship with Epstein. The direction of travel seemed set - and Mandelson would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>The even more uncomfortable factor is that last week the prime minister defended another colleague, Angela Rayner, when - you guessed it - the direction of travel in Westminster seemed set, and she would likely have to go.</p>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">undermined the prime minister's own authority</a> and blown the chance of a quick autumn reset for Labour, when the party was desperately trying to turn the page.</p>\n<p>The more generous argument made by Sir Keir's allies - he's been let down by two different people in two different ways, and has had to front up to clean up their different messes.</p>\n<p>\"Keir is frustrated and a bit angry because he is having to deal with the conduct of others, rather than show what he is trying to do,\" one source says.</p>\n<p>Another says: \"He hired someone who didn't tell him the full truth.\"</p>\n<p>No 10 doesn't imagine that the damage of the last fortnight of farce is limited to those who have departed government.</p>\n<p>And as they absorb the scale of the embarrassment over Mandelson's friendship with Epstein, new details over who knew what - and when - are emerging all the time.</p>\n<p>Westminster sources have suggested the prime minister himself had raised questions about Mandelson's links with Epstein during an initial vetting process carried out by the Cabinet Office before he was given the job.</p>\n<p>But then he was checked out again by the Foreign Office once he'd been appointed.</p>\n<h2>So where did it all begin?</h2>\n<p>Even before Labour won the election in 2024 there had been a desire in Sir Keir's circle to look beyond the traditional diplomatic appointment for their ambassador to the White House, one of the government's plum jobs.</p>\n<p>They had noted how the former Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, was sent to DC and determined that a politician could be the right choice.</p>\n<p>With his experience as a trade commissioner, an impressive spider's web of contacts, and respected political nous, Mandelson was soon determined to be an excellent potential fit.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's powerful chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, believed there were only two qualified candidates for the role, and was enthusiastic about Mandelson.</p>\n<p>Before the final decision was made last autumn, the Cabinet Office was asked, as it would be for any such candidate, to consider whether he was fit to be offered the job.</p>\n<p>Already at that stage it was no secret Mandelson had been friends with Epstein, so it was obvious those links would need to be considered.</p>\n<p>I'm told a file on Mandelson from the Cabinet Office's Propriety and Ethics Team (PET), whose job it is to know where the bodies are buried in Whitehall, was presented to the prime minister that included information about his relationship with the disgraced millionaire.</p>\n<p>On reading this file, Sir Keir had three questions he wanted to clarify with the peer, a No 10 source tells me: Why had he continued his friendship with Epstein after he was first convicted and not broken contact with him?</p>\n<p>Why had he stayed at one of Epstein's houses when the financier was in jail?</p>\n<p>And was he a \"founding citizen\" of an ocean conservation charity that Epstein had backed?</p>\n<p>That trio of questions was put to Mandelson in an email from Sir Keir's chief of staff McSweeney on his behalf.</p>\n<p>The peer, I'm told, replied to those questions in an email in which Downing Street sources now say he was \"economical with the truth\".</p>\n<p>It's understood Mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with Epstein, and told No 10 that he had not stayed in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2009 while Epstein was in prison. Another source confirmed that he told Downing Street he had not stayed there.</p>\n<p>Court documents revealed in 2023 Epstein told his private banker that Mandelson would be staying at the property. Mandelson has never explicitly denied or confirmed he did, although it has been reported that he had no recollection of doing so.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that none of those issues - the possible house stay, the charity, or the continued friendship - were discovered during the vetting process. They had been reported in previous years.</p>\n<p>But the guarantees relayed to the prime minister by Mandelson were considered sufficient to be worth the gamble of giving him the job.</p>\n<p>Once the appointment was then made, sources suggest the \"developed vetting\" process then kicked in, under the auspices of the Foreign Office.</p>\n<p>The normal process for government appointments is dependent on the job being given and the sensitivity of the material and information to be handled.</p>\n<p>But there is scarcely a job with a higher level of trust required than the White House ambassador, given the two countries' links on security, defence, trade and intelligence.</p>\n<p>I'm told nothing was flagged to No 10 as a result of the DV process, which would have involved an in-person interview which in this case, \"ought to have been completely forensic, but they must have used the wrong lens,\" according to another senior figure.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PET file, Downing Street would not receive the results of such a process as a matter of course, even in an extremely high-profile appointment. The DV process is a standalone routine.</p>\n<p>And Downing Street sources insist that they weren't made aware of any problems, so everything went ahead.</p>\n<p>The upshot? Even though there were two different processes checking out Mandelson's background, which publicly was known to include dealings with a notorious wealthy sex offender, neither appear to have turned up anything major - nor the now notorious emails which investigative reporters were able to locate recently.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall insider told me it was \"staggering - either they skipped the process of any basic due diligence, or they did that process and missed the obvious questions\".</p>\n<p>\"No one involved in making the appointment cared enough to check whether all the risk had been identified in appointing a man who had twice previously had to resign over his judgement. Careless doesn't cover it.\"</p>\n<p>The government has repeatedly said this week that part of the problem was the messages between Mandelson and Epstein were from a defunct email address.</p>\n<p>Yet a senior Whitehall figure tells me it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked, and forensic background digging been done.</p>\n<p>Neither Downing Street nor the Cabinet Office wanted to comment.</p>\n<p>Until this week, it seemed <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjd1egrlj0mo\">No 10's calculated risk of appointing Mandelson</a> was paying off.</p>\n<p>Not just because US President Donald Trump appeared to enjoy his company, praising his \"beautiful accent\" on camera recently in the Oval Office, but also because the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8dnm4dv2zo\">UK had got its trade deal</a>.</p>\n<p>The state visit was all about to unfold in its pomp and glory. Sir Keir appeared, unlike many other global leaders, to have managed to build a warm and functional relationship with the most powerful man in the western world.</p>\n<p>All of that, at least partly down to the smooth talking and politicking of the ambassador.</p>\n<p>What he and No 10 were enjoying as a successful tenure was to be suddenly disrupted when the peer featured in what's known as the Epstein \"birthday book\". It features a cosy message - Mandelson branding Epstein his \"best pal\", and a photograph of the two in which Mandelson is wearing a bathrobe.</p>\n<p>And what was to prove more serious, reporters at the news agency Bloomberg managed to get hold of a cache of Epstein's emails, which included his communications with Mandelson over months and years.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to get ahead of the story, Mandelson predicted that a whole slew of contact between the two was about to emerge into public view - and he described the revelations to The Sun as \"very embarrassing\". This sent alarm bells clanging back in Whitehall.</p>\n<p>He hadn't shared the contents of the emails with Downing Street and had been \"dismissive, claiming there was nothing new\" in the stories emerging about his friendship with Epstein earlier in the week, sources suggest.</p>\n<p>But, by late on Tuesday, the government was aware that more damaging allegations were coming, and contacted the peer to ask what was going on.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8j2d5xm78o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p>\n    <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p>\n    <p>For now, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a> isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p>\n    <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p>\n    <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Inflation chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p>\n    <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p>\n    <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p>\n    <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p>\n    <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p>\n    <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p>\n    <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p>\n    <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p>\n    <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p>\n    <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p>\n    <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p>\n    <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p>\n    <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p>\n    <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">jobs chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p>\n    <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty\">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p>\n    <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Take Lin-Manuel Miranda, a composer, lyricist, director and actor best known for creating the musical <i>Hamilton</i>. Not only has he won a \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation, but he's been called a genius in publications like <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lin-manuel-miranda-ingenuity-awards-180957234/\"> Smithsonian Magazine</a>, </p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/16/why-love-lin-manuel-miranda-crush-bim-adewunmi\">and</a></p><i>The</i><i>Guardian</i><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/yay-hamlet\">BuzzFeed</a>.</p><p>Genius implies something solitary, and we often think of it as innate. Even so, Miranda wasn't the best student when he was young; teachers weren't swooning over his early promise. As Miranda told Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, the author of a new biography, <i>Lin-Manuel Miranda: The Education of an Artist</i>: \"I was never the brightest student at Hunter College Elementary School, but I was good at making up songs, and I was good at making kids laugh, which is the only currency that matters when you are surrounded by people who are much smarter than you.\"</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner, a writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and a visiting scholar at Portland State University, says that although Miranda is undeniably talented and works very, very hard, his superpower is that he cultivates, collaborates with — and is constantly learning from — a large group of creative friends.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner's new book traces Miranda's career from elementary school musicals, to writing and starring in Disney movies, to his concept album based on the cult-classic film <i>The Warriors</i>.</p><p>Miranda, who has <a href=\"https://x.com/Lin_Manuel/status/667845524171661312\">Puerto Rican and Mexican</a> heritage, grew up in a neighborhood at the top of Manhattan, surrounded by the Latino community he extols in his Tony award-winning musical <i>In the Heights</i>. But he went to school on the snootier, more white Upper East side, which was a tremendous adjustment. He struggled at first — math made him anxious, he disliked his nose, as Pollack-Pelzner writes — but, like a lot of people who feel like they don't fit in, he gravitated toward theater.</p><p>Theater gave Miranda a place to try out his ideas, and he reached out to talented people he knew to help get them up on stage. Pollack-Pelzner writes that Miranda collects people who can teach him something, keeping many of them as lifelong collaborators: one particular friend taught him a bit about composing music; others helped him learn to freestyle. When he was hired to translate some lyrics in <i>West Side Story</i> into Spanish for a new Broadway production, he met the late composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim — and Sondheim became a mentor, helping him navigate the world of musical theater.</p><p>His family has also been a strong source of support. His mother Luz Towns-Miranda, a therapist, helped him process the big feelings that he'd later turn into songs, Pollack-Pelzner explains. His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr., a political strategist, helped him with everything from Puerto Rican slang to financial support for his productions. Miranda's wife, Vanessa Nadal, has also contributed to his successes — she prodded him to include a song for the women in <i>Hamilton</i>, which became \"The Schuyler Sisters.\"</p><p>Miranda regularly publicly thanks and praises those who have supported and taught him, and who have contributed their ideas and talents to his work. That they feel validated by him is evident from the many thoughtful, warm quotes in the book. Pollack-Pelzner says he interviewed more than 150 people and met with Miranda himself more than a dozen times. Miranda shared with him \"early scripts, rough recordings, and grainy videos of sixth-grade musicals, high school one-acts, college projects and pre-Broadway experiments,\" he writes.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner is at his strongest when he delves into the fascinating nitty gritty of the collaborations that help productions come together. People call Miranda a genius because he seamlessly mashes seemingly disparate ideas together (the American Revolution and hip-hop!) to make work that is sparkling with joy, emotionally resonant and blazingly new. And Pollack-Pelzner brings us so deeply into this work — tracing the birth of individual songs line by line — that we feel the zing of creation.</p><p>But this is not a hagiography. Pollack-Pelzner is frank about Miranda's shortcomings, such as the time when the original cast of <i>Hamilton</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/theater/hamilton-producers-and-actors-reach-deal-on-sharing-profits.html\">was fighting to share 1% of the profits</a> for the show's runaway success. Like many original casts, they had helped foster its development. Miranda — who was both a cast member who received a pay check and a creator who received royalties — tried to stay out of it, instead of advocating for them with the lead producer, and he felt \"othered\" by the cast, Pollack-Pelzner explains.</p><p>The book also wades into the murk around Miranda's attempt to influence politics.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2018/06/08/lin-manuel-miranda-amplifies-puerto-rico-fundraising-efforts-with-google-org-2m-matching-grant/\">Miranda raised millions of dollars for relief </a>after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017; he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lin-manuel-miranda-s-hamilton-funds-give-puerto-rican-art-n1040891\">wanted to raise more by bringing  Hamilton</a> to the University of Puerto Rico, his father's alma mater. But in 2016, he had asked Congress in an op-ed to support a bill that would restructure the territory's significant debt. The University of Puerto Rico had been particularly negatively affected — budgets were cut, employees threatened to strike and students protested.</p><p>\"Boy, is <i>Hamilton</i> a bad fit for raising money for Puerto Rico,\" Miranda is quoted as saying in the book. \"It's singing about the financial system that traps Puerto Rico in debt.\"</p><p>The show had to be moved to a different venue and Miranda wound up swearing off politics.</p><h4>Performing Arts</h4><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h2><h4>Lin-Manuel Miranda on the 10th anniversary of the musical 'Hamilton' on Broadway</h4><p>And yet, it was still a homecoming. When he sang, \"My name is Alexander Hamilton,\" the book recounts, \"Two thousand people rose in a standing ovation that seemed like it would last forever. 'It was the first time I <i>felt</i> a cheer,' he said after the show. 'I felt my hair move.'\"</p><p>But of course, he didn't keep all the praise for himself — at the end of the show, he brought his father onstage to thank him.</p><p>Pollack-Pelzner uses these details to treat Miranda as the creator he is — enthusiastic, vulnerable, ambitious, innovative, fallible — instead of as a mere celebrity. A different biographer might have used this as an occasion for dishy name dropping, but Pollack-Pelzner builds the case that Miranda is so successful because he is able to take all the contradictions of who he is, what he's experienced, who he knows, and combine them into work that speaks to so many. And it could be that this talent is, in fact, genius.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5532081/lin-manuel-miranda-biography-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For now, GBP/USD is hanging on to $1.3550, however, if bond yields start to rise on the back of this data, then we could see pound weakness later on Friday. The pound is the third worst performer in the G10 FX space so far today.</p>\n<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p>\n<p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>\n<p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p>\n<p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p>\n<p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p>\n<p>A Treasury spokesperson said:</p>\n<p>“We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>\n<p>Oof! The London stock market has just closed, cementing a terrible day for Ocado.</p>\n<p>Ocado’s shares have ended the day down 19.9%, at 240p, as City investors react to the news that its US partner Kroger was considering a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses.</p>\n<p>That knocks £500m off Ocado’s market value, as the company was worth just over £2.5bn at the start of the day.</p>\n<p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says:</p>\n<p>“It is hard to overstate how damaging this news is for Ocado. Kroger was one of the linchpins of its expansion strategy, and was a poster boy for the use of Ocado’s technology worldwide.</p>\n<p>Others may now follow suit. Sadly Ocado has been a losing proposition for most investors over the course of its life as a listed company, with only a brief period in 2013/14 and then from 2018-2021 really delivering the goods. Today’s news casts a dark shadow over the company and its long-suffering investors.”</p>\n<p>US consumer sentiment hit by worries about jobs and prices</p>\n<p>US consumer sentiment has fallen this month, as Americans worry about rising prices and a weakening jobs market.</p>\n<p>The University of Michican’s index of consumer morale has declined to 55.4 from 58.2 in August; according to Bloomberg that’s the lowest reading since May.</p>\n<p>Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu reports that sentiment about the economy fell particularly strongly among lower and middle income consumers, adding:</p>\n<p>Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well; current and expected personal finances both eased about 8% this month.</p>\n<p>Trade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month. Still, sentiment remains above April and May 2025 readings, immediately after the initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs.</p>\n<p>Consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to an index value of 55.4 in September (est was 58.0), driven by a big decline in the future expectations component. pic.twitter.com/XCgxqRbaso</p>\n<p>Ocado shares slide after US partner warns on robotic warehouses</p>\n<p>Shares in Ocado have now slumped even deeper into the red – down a hefty 17% today.</p>\n<p>As flagged earlier, Ocado’s shares are under pressure after key customer Kroger, the US grocery giant, said it would undertake a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. That has raised fears of weaker demand for its robotic warehouses.</p>\n<p>Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, comments:</p>\n<p>Kroger also said it was using stores ‘very heavily’ to fulfil e-commerce orders and implied that was its key focus from now on.</p>\n<p>“These comments imply that Ocado might find it harder to sell more automated solutions to Kroger, and that existing agreements might come under review. It’s the worst kind of news imaginable for Ocado investors as they’ve bought into a company which has positioned itself as the technology solution to grocery providers’ needs. While Ocado has continued to win new contracts, the pace has been erratic. The prospect of existing relationships starting to deteriorate adds another level of risk. Then there is the big question of when Ocado will ever make a sustainable profit.”</p>\n<p>The oil price has jumped today, as Russia faces more sanctions over the Ukraine war.</p>\n<p>This morning, the UK government implemented 100 new sanctions designed to hit Russia’s revenues and military supplies, including against its so-called shadow fleet carrying oil and electronics companies.</p>\n<p>US President Donald Trump has also threatened Moscow with new economic sanctions, saying that his patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin was “running out fast”.</p>\n<p>Trump told Fox News:</p>\n<p>“It’ll be hitting very hard on – with sanctions to banks and having to do with oil and tariffs also.”</p>\n<p>Brent crude is up almost 2% today, at $67.65 per barrel.</p>\n<p>A Ukranian drone attack on Russia’s northwestern port of Primorsk, which led to a suspension of oil loading operations overnight, is another factor.</p>\n<p>The UK economy could get a boost next week, during Donald Trump’s state visit.</p>\n<p>According to Bloomberg, the leaders of OpenAI and Nvidia plan to pledge support for billions of dollars in UK data centre investments when they head to the country next week, as part of Trump’s trip.</p>\n<p>SamAltman, the boss of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and chipmaker Nvidia’s chief executive JensenHuang are reportedly working with London-based data centre business NscaleGlobalHoldings on the project.

That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g4LXt/1/\">a bar graph showing monthly growth and declines in gross domestic product</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile.</p>\n    <p>The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further.</p>\n    <p>“Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.”</p>\n    <p>The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have blamed Reeves’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/autumn-budget-2024-rachel-reeves-tax-rises-public-services\">£25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution</a>, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth.</p>\n    <p>The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business.</p>\n    <p>Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade.</p>\n    <p>“The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-16\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts.</p>\n    <p>However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence.</p>\n    <p>Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.”</p>\n    <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on.</p>\n    <p>“Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.”</p>\n    <p>Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed.</p>\n    <p>The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">jumped to 3.8% in July</a>, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months.</p>\n    <p>The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.</p>\n    <p>Jobs and inflation data, due to be published earlier in the week, will give more detail of the state of the economy – though policymakers have repeatedly warned that known flaws in ONS data are making it difficult to get a clear picture.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“Our economy isn’t broken, but it does feel stuck,” is the message from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>.</p>\n    <p>Having made rebooting the economy the No 1 priority for government, it is a brutally honest assessment from a chancellor more than a year into the job.</p>\n    <p>The latest GDP figures, released on Friday, highlight the scale of the challenge for Reeves at her autumn budget. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves\">Growth flatlined in July</a>, slowing from 0.4% in June, as the economy struggled for momentum over the summer.</p>\n    <p>Some of the weakness can be explained away. Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year.</p>\n    <p>Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July.</p>\n    <p>Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers.</p>\n    <p>Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/retail-sales-rise-but-ons-apologises-as-statistics-crisis-deepens\">decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025</a> women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services.</p>\n    <p>The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds.</p>\n    <p>Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment.</p>\n    <p>As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances.</p>\n    <p>Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/uk-hit-by-fresh-sell-off-in-government-bond-markets-as-pound-weakens\">Bond market investors</a> are watching closely.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Among the big concerns is that speculation over the tax changes in the budget will dampen business activity over the coming months, even before November arrives, in a carbon copy of Labour’s first months back in office last year.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power.</p>\n    <p>On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/29/imf-global-growth-forecast-trump-tariffs-eu-trade-us\">International Monetary Fund</a> – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges.</p>\n    <p>Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/stagnant-gdp-shows-scale-of-challenge-for-rachel-reeves-at-autumn-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was sent by Mandelson to Epstein in 2008, as the financier prepared to be jailed for soliciting prostitution from someone aged under 18.</p>\n    <p>\"Fight for early release,\" Lord Mandelson is quoted as writing, adding \"your friends stay with you and love you\".</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson doesn't deny these emails.</p>\n    <p>In a statement to the BBC he said: \"I relied on assurances of his innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false.\"</p>\n    <p>We have asked him to respond to Bloomberg's revelations.</p>\n    <p>At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked Sir Keir about Lord Mandelson and whether it was \"tenable\" for him to remain as ambassador.</p>\n    <p>Among Labour MPs, there is exasperation.</p>\n    <p>\"I am angry about Keir defending Mandelson today.

The document revealed that Russia had launched two cyber attacks prior to the election, one against a company that sold software related to voter registration, and another against 122 local election officials. </p>\n    <p>The contractor, an Air Force veteran named <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/06/531722218/what-we-know-about-reality-winner-government-contractor-accused-of-nsa-leak\">Reality Winner</a>, sent the document to <i>The Intercept, </i>a journalism site specializing in reporting leaks. But Winner admits now that she made a crucial miscalculation.</p>\n    <p>\"What I had assumed was they would receive it [and] immediately assume that this was something that was important, that it answered very important questions that the country was having, that it would be protected,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>That's not what happened. Instead, in the process of fact-checking the document, the reporters assigned to the story sent the document to the FBI, which sent it to the NSA. The security agency easily identified Winner, a crypto linguist, as the source of the leak.</p>\n    <p>Looking back now, Winner says her timing could not have been worse; the Trump administration had been combatting a string of leaks. FBI director <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/17/602849276/james-comey-to-fresh-air-the-fbi-isnt-on-anybodys-side\">James Comey</a> and the president \"were both saying that they were going to nail the next leaker to the wall,\" she says. \"And then I just happened to be the very next name popping up.\"</p>\n    <p>Winner was tried under the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/28/534682231/once-reserved-for-spies-espionage-act-now-used-against-suspected-leakers\">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and received the longest sentence to that point for leaking classified information to a media outlet. She accepted a plea deal, lowering her sentence of 10 years to five. She was released from prison in 2021.</p>\n    <p>Winner's story has been told in a 2021 documentary <i>Reality Winner</i>, the 2023 film <i>Reality, </i>and in<i> </i>the play <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/10/12/1044602235/is-this-a-room-reality-winner-play\"> Is This A Room</a>, in which actors reenacted the transcript of the FBI interrogation of her. Now, she's looking back in a memoir titled</p>\n    <p><i>I Am Not Your Enemy.</i>It's not a tell-all, she says, because she's still bound by the non-disclosure agreement she signed with the NSA.</p>\n    <p>\"I am under a lasting ... non-disclosure agreement to never talk about anything that could be related to classified information from my Air Force career as a linguist, and then, moving forward, anything that I had done as an NSA contractor, and furthermore, anything within the four corners of the document that I leaked,\" she says.</p>\n    <h3>Interview highlights</h3>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/994x1500+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2Fd3%2Fd5218f2c49f7a722cdad2adfc1e9%2F71vkiu11jhl-sl1500.jpg\" alt=\"71VKiU11JHL._SL1500_.jpg\"/>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what it was like in the Georgia county jail </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The conditions of that county jail in Lincoln County, Ga. were abhorrent. ... I had been sheltered and privileged and naïve before that. I did not ever imagine that conditions like that would be considered normal or even good for any American in custody. And I was assured several times over that I was being treated the best and that was the most comfortable county jail in the area.</p>\n    <p>I was given this plastic mat with this crumpled plastic wool falling out of it [to sleep on]. It was held together with duct tape. That was my mat. … There was one sink, a picnic table that was covered in rust in the center of the room, a toilet that was about three feet away from that picnic table that we were supposed to sit and eat at, and a shower directly by the toilet with a black mold-crusted shower curtain over it. There was something so dystopian about it. … The toilet had a brown bedsheet draped over it so that you didn't have to eat at the table and make eye contact with somebody using the toilet.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On being transferred to a federal prison in Carswell, Texas</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>My first week there, I felt like I was at Harvard. I couldn't believe how big the compound was. It was two buildings and a very small rec center with a concrete track. <strong>… </strong>My sensory deprivation of 15, 16 months only existing in one room [in the Georgia county jail], I just remembered walking around Carswell and thinking, I'm going to get lost here every single day. It's just so big.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On experiencing COVID-19 restrictions in prison</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>We were confined to our cells, which did not have restrooms. So we had to ask 24-7, seven days a week, to go use the restroom from another adult. We were no longer allowed to go outside and our movements were controlled around the unit. We couldn't just shower when we wanted to shower or go use their phones. As they eased up, we were still not allowed outside of the unit. …</p>\n    <p>The positive mail kept me going. I also had a network where I could just ask for any book I wanted and it would show up. So in addition to getting every single book I heard you talk about on <i>Fresh Air</i> for four years, I was basically the library for everybody in the unit. They would give me their requests and people's books would show up.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On struggling after her release, especially with darkness</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>For the first time in four years, I had actually seen what a dark room looked like. … I had never been alone in a room before, with the exception of solitary confinement, but that wasn't really alone. So I was just so terrified all the time. I could not feel at ease in any way, shape or form. I never expected that would be something that I would feel. … Nobody tells you that once you get out of prison life just gets harder.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On conflict with her mother after her release</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The biggest point of contention between my mother and I was the status of my notoriety and the fact that she had been out for four years doing interviews about me and ... that she felt obligated to tell her Twitter following updates about me while the halfway house was saying, \"If your presence is detected on social media, or if we feel like you're communicating on social in any way, or that we feel you're in danger, we will take you back into custody.\" And my mother had wanted to tweet that I was home. And I said that they would take me back into custody if people knew I was at that home address. And she said that she wanted to be truthful to her following. And I just felt so offended, like the only reason why you had that following was to support me and I'm sitting right here in front of you and you care more about them than me. … I felt like while I was at my most vulnerable, she was still processing things through being interviewed about me instead of being my mom. And, you know, our relationship is still on the mend.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>On what she's doing now</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I'm a level two CrossFit coach and I am currently going to Texas A&amp;M University Kingsville in the veterinary technology program. … We did have to send attorneys for permission to at least take the state licensing test so that I could help my school out with passing rates, but [as a convicted felon] I will never be a licensed vet tech.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Sam Briger and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

He is wearing glasses and a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie. \"/>\n    <p>Peter Mandelson has been sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US, after revelations emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>\n    <p>Given the job in December 2024, he was the man Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer tasked with building links to the incoming Trump administration.</p>\n    <p>No 10 believed Lord Mandelson's ability as a networker and seasoned political operator was a valuable asset. Indeed, he was dubbed the Trump whisperer, and his close relationship with the White House were clear to see.</p>\n    <p>But it is due to one of his former connections that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0v81zeggko\">he has now lost</a> this plum diplomatic role.</p>\n    <p>And it is far from the first time Lord Mandelson has lost his job, in a turbulent 40-year-long career in British politics.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was born into Labour Party royalty - his grandfather was Herbert Morrison, a cabinet minister in Clement Attlee's 1945 government, revered by Labour members.</p>\n    <p>He began working for Labour in the 1980s, when the party was at its lowest ebb, suffering successive defeats to Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>The painful 1992 defeat - when Neil Kinnock's Labour were unexpectedly beaten - spurred Mandelson in his belief that the party needed to modernise if they were ever to get back into government.</p>\n    <p>In 1994, he played a pivotal role in getting Tony Blair elected as party leader - crucially backing him over Gordon Brown, who had been seen as the heir apparent.</p>\n    <p>For a long time it seemed that Brown would never forgive his former ally for this, in his eyes, betrayal.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67b9/live/2858bc60-8f13-11f0-bf0b-13ad835103b3.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson\"/>\n    <p>Despite lingering tensions, the three men continued to work together and were the key architects of New Labour, the rebranding aimed at making the party electable.</p>\n    <p>In 1997 their work paid off, and following the landslide victory, Mandelson was given the job of minister without portfolio and then trade secretary.</p>\n    <p>The archetypal spin doctor, his reputation as a behind-the scenes fixer, schemer and schmoozer earned him the nickname, \"the Prince of Darkness\".</p>\n    <p>In 1998, he was forced into the first of his government resignations when it was revealed he had received a secret loan of £373,000 from his ministerial colleague Geoffrey Robinson.</p>\n    <p>Less than a year later he was back in government taking on the position of Northern Ireland secretary.</p>\n    <p>He lasted in that job until January 2001, when he quit over allegations of misconduct over a passport application for the Hinduja brothers. An inquiry later cleared him of wrongdoing.</p>\n    <p>His indignation at being booted out came boiling over later that year when he held onto his constituency seat of Hartlepool, despite challenges from left-wing candidates.</p>\n    <p>In an extraordinary and emotional victory speech, he said: \"It was said that I was facing political ruin. My career in tatters, apparently never to be part of the political living again.</p>\n    <p>\"Well, they underestimated Hartlepool. And they underestimated me. Because I am fighter and not a quitter!\"</p>\n    <p>Two years later he quit as an MP to become the EU's trade commissioner.</p>\n    <p>When Brown became prime minister in 2007, another comeback in British politics for Mandelson looked unlikely.</p>\n    <p>But in a shock move, a beleaguered Brown, suffering low polling ratings, appeared to bury the hatchet and appointed his former friend as business secretary, making him a peer at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson was tasked with reinvigorating the government, which appeared to have run out of steam after a decade in power.</p>\n    <p>While many Labour backbenchers and members acknowledged Mandelson's presentational skill and strategic nous, they held him responsible for ditching some of the party's key socialist principles.</p>\n    <p>He was held in such suspicion, that Tony Blair once said the New Labour project would only be complete when party members had \"learnt to love Peter Mandelson\".</p>\n    <p>Mandelson himself said that was setting the bar too high. However, he seemed to have succeeded at the 2009 Labour Party conference when Mandelson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8279705.stm\">delivered a rousing speech</a> to despondent delegates, telling them: \"If I can come back, we can come back.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/977a/live/79e0ac10-8efe-11f0-ad1d-477615c292d0.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A smiling Donald Trump shakes hands with Mandelson in the Oval Office. \"/>\n    <p>After Labour lost power, Mandelson started international lobbying firm, Global Counsel, where he was able to continue amassing influential contacts in business and politics.</p>\n    <p>These contacts, along with his ability to charm (he was nicknamed \"silver tongue\" by US President George W Bush), were among the reasons he was considered a strong candidate when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was looking for a new ambassador in Washington.</p>\n    <p>He had holidayed with Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and made connections with Mark Burnett, the TV producer of the Apprentice, the show that sparked Trump's rise to power.</p>\n    <p>However, one of these connections has led to his downfall - his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, which continued after the American financier had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18.</p>\n    <p>Mandelson had been widely-considered to have performed well in his first months as ambassador, but following the public release of his embarrassing correspondence with Epstein - and the threat of more to come - No 10 has decided to jettison him.</p>\n    <p>Throughout his career, Mandelson's ability to hob-nob with the rich and powerful has been an asset but has repeatedly got him into trouble.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year, a friend of Mandelson told the BBC: \"He has weaknesses. He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"</p>\n    <p>Former MP Ben Bradshaw, who was in the cabinet with Mandelson, likened him to \"a sort of Icarus type figure\".</p>\n    <p>\"He's proved himself to be extremely effective in a number of jobs but at times he's flown too close to the sun,\" he told the BBC's World at One.</p>\n    <p>At the age of 71, having been forced out of office three times across four decades, it could be that this fall really does mark the last chapter in Peter Mandelson's extraordinary career.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4q61y399xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the UK, the owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges.</p>\n<p>John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology.</p>\n<p>As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.</p>\n<p>Wall Street’s main indexes have opened higher, despite today’s data showing a jump in unemployment claims and consumer prices.</p>\n<p>Rather than worrying about the state of the labor market, traders seem to be betting that the USFederalReserve is on track to cut interest rates next week.</p>\n<p>The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 218 points, or 0.5%, in early trading to 45,708 points.</p>\n<p>The broader S&amp;P 500 index is 0.25% higher.</p>\n<p>Analysts at ING agree that the Fed’s focus is now the jobs market.</p>\n<p>James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist, explains:</p>\n<p>Inflation was a touch higher than expected and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated over coming months, but the the weakening of the jobs market is now the Fed’s priority, with rising jobless claims hinting at a pick-up in lay-offs at a time when hiring is subdued</p>\n<p>The number of initial claims (a proxy for layoffs) in Texas almost doubled in the week to 6 September, to 31,908 from 16,604 in the previous seven days.</p>\n<p>There was also an increase of 2,980 in Michigan, but many other states recorded a drop in claims (before seasonal adjustments).</p>\n<p>Bloomberg economist Eliza Winger says:</p>\n<p>The surge in initial jobless claims in the first week of September came primarily from Texas, while claims declined in most states. While any deterioration in the labor market bears watching given growing labor-market weakness, a broader increase in claims would have been much more concerning.”</p>\n<p>Experts: Fed likely to cut rates to help weak jobs market</p>\n<p>The jump in US jobless claims last week, and the pick-up in inflation in August, are a worrying sign for America’s economy.</p>\n<p>Together, they paint a picture of an economy losing jobs, as consumers are hit by rising prices in the shops, as tariffs are passed onto consumers.</p>\n<p>Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank, explains:</p>\n<p>“The August CPI inflation report was a hot one, no matter how you slice or dice it. President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now.</p>\n<p>“Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6th September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021.</p>\n<p>This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.”</p>\n<p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying:</p>\n<p>While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years.</p>\n<p>This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view.</p>\n<p>New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high</p>\n<p>Ouch! The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless support has hit its highest level in almost four years.</p>\n<p>The number of ‘initial claims’ for unemployment benefits jumped by 27,000 last week to 263,000, the highest level for initial claims since October 23, 2021.</p>\n<p>Aaron Hill, chief market analyst at FP Markets, says the jobs slowdown will fan speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, adding:​</p>\n<p>The central bank faces mounting pressure, but its room to manoeuvre is razor-thin.</p>\n<p>Companies 'passing rising costs from tariffs onto consumers'</p>\n<p>US inflation “continued its march higher” in August, reports KatyStoves, investment manager at MattioliWoods.</p>\n<p>Stoves says US companies are now passing the cost of tariffs onto customers:</p>\n<p>With buffer inventories that had been built ahead of tariffs being depleted, businesses are now forced to replenish stock at elevated prices. With the tariffs looking to be more permanent, companies now have cover to pass these rising costs onto consumers, rather than compressing margins.</p>\n<p>Whilst some had anticipated tariffs would create a one-off price adjustment, the data increasingly suggests this may be a more prolonged process with peak effects still to come.</p>\n<p>The prices of all six major American grocery store food groups rose in August, today’s US inflation report shows.</p>\n<p>The index for fruitsandvegetables rose 1.6% over the month, as tomato prices jumped by 4.5% and apple prices increased by 3.5%.</p>\n<p>The meats, poultry, fish and eggs index increased by 1.0% in August with the beef index up by 2.7%.

Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.</p>\n    <p>Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US jobs market is weakening</a>.</p>\n    <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.</p>\n    <p>US stocks shot up on Wednesday after the producer price index, which tracks wholesale prices, showed a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/ppi-inflation-august-2025-.html\">slight dip</a> in August after a steep rise in July, making investors hopeful that inflation – while still rising – is going up at a slow pace.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/7pYlh/1/\">latest inflation chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Fed has refrained from cutting rates over the past year, citing instability in the economy introduced by federal immigration and trade policies. The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.</p>\n    <p>At his closely watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.</p>\n    <p>Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.</p>\n    <p>“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.</p>\n    <p>Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.</p>\n    <p>Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">went into the negative</a> for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I mention this mistake because it testifies to something powerful about Patrick Ryan's new novel, <i>Buckeye</i>.</p><p>When I made a late request for an advance review copy of <i>Buckeye,</i> the copy I received looked fine, but when I opened it I realized it was mistakenly bound backwards. The title page was at the very end of this over-450-page novel. </p><p>So, as a kind of brain exercise, I began reading<i> Buckeye</i> backwards, my head moving from right to left. By page 9, I was already so caught up in the world Ryan creates, <i>Buckeye</i> could have been misprinted upside down and sideways and I still wouldn't have been able to put it down.</p><h4>Author Interviews</h4><h2>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h2><h4>The novel 'Buckeye' explores forgiveness, war and a forbidden kiss</h4><p>As its title indicates, <i>Buckeye</i> is set in Ohio, in a fictional small town called Bonhomie. The story, which focuses on two married couples, stretches from pre-World War II to the close of the 20th century. Margaret Salt is married to Felix — a closeted gay man who kind of, maybe, harbors the unarticulated hope that marriage might render his same sex desires dormant. </p><p>When the novel opens, Margaret, who's a red-headed, green-eyed \"looker,\" walks into the town hardware store where Cal Jenkins works and demands that he turn on the radio. There's commotion on the streets outside and, especially since her husband, Felix, is serving in the Navy, Margaret wants to know what's happening. It turns out that Germany has just surrendered to the Allies. Hearing the news, Margaret grabs Cal by his shoulders and kisses him. And Cal — a good husband and new father — likes it.</p><p>From that impulsive moment all sorts of complications and secrets sprout. While this teaser of a plot summary may make <i>Buckeye</i> seem like the stuff of vintage soap operas, the atmosphere of this novel is wry and contemplative rather than melodramatic. Ryan — whose previous books include the standout 2016 short story collection, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/485842485/the-dream-life-of-astronauts-is-a-journey-to-emotional-deep-space\"> The Dream Life of Astronauts</a>, as well as three YA novels — ambitiously aims here to write an American epic and he has the chops to do so. Ryan's omniscient narrator takes turns experiencing events from the four main characters' points of view, always subtly underscoring how contingency shapes our lives.</p><p>Cal, for instance, was born with one leg two inches shorter than the other — two inches that would keep him out of World War II and put him in Margaret's path. Cal's wife, Becky, discovered in childhood that she has the ability to communicate with the dead — a gift that will prove to be a grim comfort during the Vietnam War.</p><p>Chapters roam fluidly here from flashbacks to Margaret's tough start in life in an orphanage to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/01/14/462923148/herman-wouk-says-hes-a-happy-gent-at-100\">Herman Wouk</a>-like section chronicling the torpedoing of that cargo ship Felix is serving on. Felix meets the love of his life on that ship, a fellow sailor who quotes St. Thomas Aquinas to him, saying: \"The things that we love tell us what we are.\" The decades-long aftermath of silent grief that Felix must endure after the loss of that relationship is the anguished emotional core of this novel.</p><p>What Ryan captures in <i>Buckeye</i> is both the sweep of history and the mostly mundane particularity of everyday life. If there's a flaw to find in this overwhelming novel it may be that the characters are a bit too uniformly eloquent and self-aware. But, really, why complain about too many epiphanies when they're expressed as beautifully as this? I leave you with our narrator describing Felix in old age realizing something about time:</p><blockquote><p>What is it about time that confounds us? We spend it. We save it. We while it away. We waste it. We kill it. ... We regret what we’ve done with it. We give it away. We want it back. ... Felix saw it so clearly: all we should ever want of time is more of it. Life was so simple when it was reduced to the barest of necessities: more time; more air; more Duke Ellington.</p></blockquote></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5535609/buckeye-patrick-ryan-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For example, he looked for ways to spend his allowance.</p>\n    <p>\"He was kind of a loner, but not in a bad way or a sad way,\" said Bonomo, an English professor at Northern Illinois University. \"He would go to this little dime store and this little fish store.

And so that was probably an extra factor in my being drawn to this book,\" he said.</p>\n    <h3>Henry Huggins' moral dilemma</h3>\n    <p>For Dirda, the ending of the book was a revelation.</p>\n    <p>In the last chapter of the first<i> Henry Huggins</i> (spoiler alert if you haven't read it!), an older boy comes looking for Henry after seeing a picture of him and Ribsy in the local paper. When he sees the dog, he shouts \"Dizzy!\" The dog jumps up on the boy, licks his hands and wags his tail.</p>\n    <p>Cleary writes: \"A terrible thought came to Henry. Ribsy must have belonged to the boy before he found him in the drugstore over a year ago.\"</p>\n    <p>Both boys claim ownership of the dog and tell of how much they care for him. The kids decide to have a contest to let Ribsy choose who gets to keep him.</p>\n    <p>Each boy stands \"twenty squares down the sidewalk in opposite directions\" of the dog. On \"Go,\" the older boy yells \"Here Dizzy!\" while Henry yells \"Here Ribsy!\" The tension builds as Ribsy seems torn, wagging his tail when he looks back and forth at both boys. Ultimately, he walks toward Henry.</p>\n    <p>\"I was glad Henry got to keep his dog,\" Dirda remembers. \"But then I thought, 'The other guy, he loved the dog, too. And is it right that Henry should take his dog?'\"</p>\n    <p>Dirda has written about how Henry Huggins was the first book that forced him to confront a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-henry-huggins-and-lolita-can-teach-us-about-tolerance--and-civil-discourse/2019/12/30/b7862014-2b30-11ea-bcb3-ac6482c4a92f_story.html\">moral dilemma</a>.</p>\n    <p>\"All these things ran through my head as a kid. And it was at that point that I started to recognize that books were not simple stories with all these Disney kind of happy endings where everything works out perfectly for everybody and everyone is happy,\" said Dirda. It showed him that \"in fact, life is much more complicated and that there are some issues where there isn't a clear cut answer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1920x1502+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Fde%2F1f9a940641569cdc37dc1c6a9728%2Fhenry-huggins-jacqueline-rogers-aquarium.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of Henry Huggins.\"/>\n    <p>\n                An illustration from Jacqueline Rogers' that appears in later versions of <i>Henry Huggins.</i>\n                <strong>\n                    \n                    HarperCollins\n                    \n                </strong>\n                <strong>hide caption</strong></p>\n    <p>\n      <strong/>\n    </p>\n    <strong>toggle caption</strong>\n    <h3>A different dilemma: Native American stereotypes</h3>\n    <p>For decades, Cleary has been praised for her authenticity when describing the experiences of average, middle-class kids. In 1999, Beverly Cleary <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/26/311881785/beverly-cleary-creator-of-ramona-quimby-dies-at-104\">told</a> NPR, \"I think children like to find themselves in books.\" But her lead characters are white, and some of the plotlines perpetuate stereotypes.</p>\n    <p>In more than one Henry book, he pretends to be an American Indian. He's cast as \"Second Indian\" in a school play: He wears a robe and a feather from his mother's duster and says \"Ugh!\" In another book, his mother pretends to be afraid of him when he's dressed up as an Indian for Halloween.</p>\n    <p>Debbie Reese, who writes the blog <a href=\"https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2023/02/stereotypes-in-beverly-clearys-henry.html\">American Indians In Children's Literature</a>, says that while she understands why <i>Henry Huggins</i> is popular, she worries that white kids might \"read right through that problematic content … and not recognize it as harmful or a misrepresentation.\"</p>\n    <p>But Reese says the offensive text shouldn't be excised. She advises educators and parents to make it a teachable moment and tell kids: \"Oh, here's a mistake. That's not true. Native people didn't do this or they didn't look like that. I would like them to take it head on and say that it's a mistake.\"</p>\n    <p>Reese wants young readers and their families to know that \"books are not sacred. They are just someone's words, someone's stories. And some of those stories are wrong.\" At the same time, Reese said she \"wasn't surprised that it had problematic content because most of those classic books do.\"</p>\n    <p>To date, Cleary's first novel has sold more than 3 million copies worldwide. She wrote five more <i>Henry Huggins</i> books, with the final one in the series revolving around his canine companion <i>Ribsy</i>. Another character in the series, his mischievous neighbor <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2010/07/23/128689937/ramona-quimby-the-mischievous-girl-next-door\">Ramona Quimby</a>, was so popular that Cleary gave her an eponymous series of her own.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Meghan Sullivan</i>\n      <i> edited this story for broadcast and digital.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5418029/henry-huggins-beverly-cleary-ramona-quimby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nominations open today, with a winner announced on 25 October.</p>\n    <p>To stand, candidates must have the backing of at least 80 MPs and secure that backing this week, and either 5% of local parties or three Labour affiliated groups.</p>\n    <p>The left wing Labour MP Richard Burgon, who served on Jeremy Corbyn's front bench, described it as \"the <a href=\"https://x.com/RichardBurgon/status/1965078718843687342\">mother of all stitch ups</a>\" and later added \"despite the stitch up, Labour members deserve a Left candidate on the ballot.\"</p>\n    <p>But plenty in government and in the wider party want to get the contest done quickly and with minimal noise.</p>\n    <p>The party's general secretary Hollie Ridley told Labour MPs that it was essential that \"we will remain mindful that the Labour Party's primary duty is to serve the country\",</p>\n    <p>Translation: let's not tear ourselves to shreds in public with Labour folk falling over themselves to say why the government hasn't been good enough.</p>\n    <p>\"If there's a contest and you're in government, it is very hard to see how it goes well,\" one longstanding Labour figure tells me.</p>\n    <p>\"We should take the opportunity to abolish the post altogether. It's existence only feeds factional infighting,\" another MP texts, just ahead of the timetable for the contest being set out.</p>\n    <p>This vacancy coincides with a reshuffle that many within the party and beyond regarded as the government tilting to the Right.</p>\n    <p>When the Telegraph of all news organs heralded what it called \"a welcome Rightwards shift\" then perhaps it is little wonder that some on the party's soft Left as well as hard Left might be jittery.</p>\n    <p>They might want those jitters to be expressed and personified in who replaces Angela Rayner.</p>\n    <p>\"If the leadership put forward a serving minister, it could backfire quite badly. The reshuffle was about a particular faction in the party. It eliminated the soft Left from positions of influence,\" claims a Labour veteran.</p>\n    <p>Entering the contest this morning, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who happens to be addressing trades unionists at the TUC Congress in Brighton this afternoon.</p>\n    <p>She and No10 will hope she hoovers up vast amounts of support among MPs to try to give the outcome of any race an air of inevitability.</p>\n    <p>A fellow minister, Alison McGovern, is also weighing up running.</p>\n    <p>But if those outside government, such as Emily Thornberry and Lucy Powell, can persuade enough MPs to back them, they would be far freer to speak their minds in a contest.</p>\n    <p>While either Thornberry or Powell would offer a critique of the government from the Left, others say neither are a true voice of the Labour Left and bemoan a timetable they are convinced is designed to squeeze out a candidate such as Bell Ribeiro-Addy.</p>\n    <p>In the meantime, how loud does the contest become?</p>\n    <p>And then, when we know the winner, the prime minister will have to work out what to do with the party's new deputy.</p>\n    <p>Recent precedent suggests they take a role in government – as Angela Rayner did, and as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6234692.stm\">Harriet Harman </a>did, when she won the deputy leadership in 2007 when Labour was in government. </p>\n    <p>But perhaps that won't happen this time.</p>\n    <p>\"I think that is less of a consideration actually,\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.</p>\n    <p>The consequences of the Angela Rayner property saga are not over yet for Labour.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Her dark brown hair is in a bob and she is smiling, wearing mulberry lipstick. Sheis wearing a black jacket and an indigo top with a silver chain link necklace.\"/>\n    <p>The ripple effects of the Angela Rayner saga roll on.</p>\n    <p>A cacophony of Labour voices now, via an official party process, are offering their views in public about whether the government is any good or not.</p>\n    <p>You don't need to be steeped in political strategy to grasp why some in and around Downing Street could really have done without this and want it all over as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>So far, we have seen a limited amount of the contenders: the Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson gave a speech to trades unionists at the TUC Congress in Brighton, in which she made no reference to the contest at all.</p>\n    <p>The left winger Bell Ribeiro-Addy has done some interviews with journalists and Alison McGovern has popped up on Newsnight.</p>\n    <p>Some of the others I have spoken to will be out and about before long, but are focused for now on touring the tearooms and attempting to fill their spreadsheets with the names of supporters.</p>\n    <p>Time is tight and the bar is high – cobbling together 80 people willing to back you in a handful of days isn't easy.</p>\n    <p>Already, though, we have had an insight into how awkward this race could prove for the government, depending on who makes it through the early stages.</p>\n    <p>Take Emily Thornberry. She served in Sir Keir Starmer's shadow cabinet before the general election and expected to be offered a cabinet job in his government after Labour had won.</p>\n    <p>No such offer came.</p>\n    <p>Now she is running to be deputy leader of the party. It is a story line with a certain soap opera appeal.</p>\n    <p>And already Thornberry has been punchily critical of the government, in just one post on social media.</p>\n    <p>\"We've made mistakes and must listen. Welfare. Gaza. Wealth tax,\" she wrote, adding, archly that she wouldn't \"just nod along,\" a line seemingly aimed at Phillipson and Alison McGovern, the other candidate who is also a government minister.</p>\n    <p>Imagine Labour's deputy leader, were Thornberry to win, spending the autumn talking up a wealth tax, in the weeks before the Budget in November.</p>\n    <p>But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n    <p>Firstly, she has a lot of MPs to find to back her.</p>\n    <p>Attempting to do that, and in just a few days, led Ribeiro-Addy to publicly complain about the process being anti democratic.</p>\n    <p>She has also criticised the government for not scrapping the two-child benefit cap, she wants a full arms embargo and sanctions to be imposed on Israel, and the ban on Palestine Action to be removed.</p>\n    <p>Of course, hers is a campaign that may only last a few days. Let's see.</p>\n    <p>So, how many of the candidates are serious contenders here, and who are they?</p>\n    <p>Bridget Phillipson is well on the way to 80 MPs backing her already, with 44.</p>\n    <p>Lucy Powell isn't far behind with 35.</p>\n    <p>The others are all in single figures.</p>\n    <p>But hundreds of Labour MPs are yet to endorse anyone.</p>\n    <p>The key question now is which candidates clear this first hurdle, and how many of them are not in government and so more free to criticise it as the race heads to its next stage?</p>\n    <p>This is likely to be a key factor in shaping the tenor and tone of the debate that follows – and the eventual winner.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c61f/live/eb6dea00-0b00-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

That's not so clear.</p>\n    <p>At the weekend John Healey, the defence secretary, said the government was looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels.</p>\n    <p>That was in the works before the reshuffle. It may be that Mahmood seeks to accelerate the timetable for closing hotels.</p>\n    <p>Sir Keir has said that he wants to close them all before the next general election though he alluded in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live last week to bringing that deadline forward.</p>\n    <p>Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from which both Reform UK and increasingly the Conservatives say the UK must withdraw to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was looking at ways to change UK law to make clearer to judges here the way in which the government believes the convention should be interpreted.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood may want to go further but it is hard to see how that would be possible given Lord Hermer, who remains in post as attorney general, not to mention the prime minister himself, are both ardently opposed to withdrawal.</p>\n    <p>We may not need to wait long to find out what Mahmood's new direction will be. Only a week after taking office as justice secretary last year, she announced plans to release thousands of prisoners earlier than planned to avoid what she called \"total collapse\" of the prison system.</p>\n    <p>Her handling of prison overcrowding, especially her willingness to grasp the nettle so early on, has been frequently compared favourably by Labour MPs to other cabinet ministers who were seen as taking too long to work out how they wanted to deal with their portfolios.</p>\n    <p>One ally of Mahmood told the BBC: \"She knows that time is of the essence. She didn't take long to take big decisions at the Ministry of Justice, and she doesn't tend to hang about.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95ec/live/97747df0-8ca2-11f0-a721-a79c3c3eadc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media Shabana Mahmood visits HMP Bedford, alongside the prison's governor, Sarah Bott. The pair walk along a while corridor and in the background there is a prison officer holding open a white gate.\"/>\n    <p>One of the biggest changes might come in rhetoric and communication style.</p>\n    <p>Cooper was shadow home secretary for seven years in two stints and also spent five years as chairwoman of the home affairs select committee. Some in Labour pushing for a harder line on immigration occasionally complained that her deep knowledge of the issues involved made her public comments too nuanced to embody public dissatisfaction.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is likely to go another way.</p>\n    <p>That was definitely the sense from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7xyn03yno\">her first brief interview in the role</a> on Monday, in which she repeatedly vowed to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration, suggested she could withdraw visas from countries that do not \"play ball\" on migrant returns and embraced the potential introduction of ID cards  - all in clear, plain language.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood, 44, has been an MP for 15 years representing a constituency in Birmingham, but it is only in the past two years that she has moved into front-line, high-profile roles.</p>\n    <p>After spending her first five years in Parliament in a range of junior shadow ministerial portfolios, she co-chaired Cooper's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 2015. She then refused to serve under Jeremy Corbyn, instead dedicating her time during his leadership to fighting those on Labour's left-wing from a position on Labour's national executive committee, to which she was elected by Labour MPs.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, at the lowest ebb of Sir Keir's leadership, she was brought into the shadow cabinet to take charge of Labour's election campaign infrastructure. Even in that job, though, she was pushing her party to get over what she called its \"queasiness\" about talking tough on immigration.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/shabana-mahmood-the-woman-behind-labours-election-campaign-pk5vx3bn3\">In an interview with the Times in 2023</a>, she said: \"In the commentariat, among very politically engaged people, there's a sort of assumption about who is motivated by immigration as an electoral issue. </p>\n    <p>\"My constituency experience is that, actually, that's not got very much to do with race. I represent a very diverse constituency that's 70% non-white, and immigration comes up as an issue that my voters who are black or Asian and from other ethnic minorities want to talk about.\"</p>\n    <p>That is an argument you can be sure she will be making as home secretary in the coming weeks.</p>\n    <p>Whether she can address those concerns will determine not just her political fortunes but those of this government and prime minister too.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

She seems to be everywhere you turn in Birmingham, popping up on three panels, including two appearances on the main stage.</p>\n    <p>A lawyer and former prosecutor, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK in June, she says she entered politics to improve outcomes for the victims of crime.</p>\n    <p>A Conservative supporter since a teenager, Cunningham says she was a \"huge fan\" of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>\n    <p>\"But the Tory party changed,\" she says, accusing the Conservatives of failures over home ownership, taxation and crime over many years.</p>\n    <p>She has been tipped to be Reform's candidate for the London mayoral election in 2028, although she's coy about that prospect and stresses the party hasn't even started the selection process yet.</p>\n    <p>\"I'll help the party in any way they need me,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Stephen Atkinson is the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council - another name party bosses have high hopes for.</p>\n    <p>A self-taught engineer who set up a business that makes school furniture, Atkinson rose through the ranks of local politics with the Conservative Party in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>Then the Brexit years came, and like an increasing number of Reform UK's new joiners, Atkinson quit the Conservatives after becoming disillusioned with the party.</p>\n    <p>Since becoming council leader in Lancashire in May, Atkinson says he has focused on the \"huge financial challenges\" facing his Reform UK administration, alongside bread-and-butter issues such as fixing potholes.</p>\n    <p>In the future, he says, it would be a \"great honour\" to be a parliamentary candidate for the party where he lives in the Ribble Valley, if he was selected.</p>\n    <p>\"But that's a decision for other people,\" he adds.</p>\n    <p>If Reform does manage to get into government, and four years out from a general election it is still a very big \"if\", some of the party's would-be MPs may find fewer opportunities to rise to the highest levels of politics.</p>\n    <p>Farage and Zia Yusuf, the party's new head of policy, have talked about appointing dozens of new peers to take up roles in a Reform UK cabinet.</p>\n    <p>Could former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries - unveiled this week to much fanfare as Reform UK's latest Tory defector - be drafted into the Lords?</p>\n    <p>Former Conservative Party chairman Jake Berry was also doing the media rounds in Birmingham, and was seen walking into Friday night's afterparty in the main hall, where US pop legends the Jacksons made a surprise appearance on stage.</p>\n    <p>Like one of the back-up singers, Berry may be one of those called upon to make up the numbers in one of the many elections Reform UK wants to win.</p>\n    <p>In his conference speech, Farage said the party was taking the London mayoral election \"seriously\", as well as polls in Wales and Scotland next year.</p>\n    <p>He said Reform needed 5,000 vetted candidates to fight those polls, which he called \"an essential building block as we head towards a general election\".</p>\n    <p>As he closed the Birmingham conference, he called for volunteers in the audience to get to their feet if they wanted to stand in next year's elections.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the people's army in operation,\" Farage said.</p>\n    <p>In a symbolic gesture, some in the audience did stand, but the actual process for selection is designed to be far more rigorous.</p>\n    <p>Candidate selection has always been a thorny issue for Farage's various electoral vehicles, with election campaigns blown off course by scandals.</p>\n    <p>Party insiders like to describe Reform's rapid expansion - while ensuring candidates are properly vetted - as being like assembling a jumbo jet while flying it.</p>\n    <p>They insist they have improved their vetting system since last year's general election, after some candidates were ditched or suspended over offensive comments on social media ahead of the general election.</p>\n    <p>The party now has assessment centres, where candidates are put through their paces, and a centre for excellence, where activists are caught how to campaign effectively.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1182/live/c3cf4aa0-8b1d-11f0-b7cb-a948b12ba583.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Stephen Atkinson, the Reform UK leader of Lancashire County Council\"/>\n    <p>Thomas Kerr, the former group leader of the Scottish Conservatives, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy48p5132qno\">defected to Reform in January</a>, was also doing the rounds of the fringe panels in Birmingham, and says he hopes to stand in next year's Holyrood elections.</p>\n    <p>Asked if Reform UK is one-man band, Kerr says: \"I don't think that if Farage was to fall under a bus that Reform wouldn't be polling where we are, because of the momentum behind the party.\"</p>\n    <p>Is the party getting more recognisable spokespeople though?</p>\n    <p>\"I think they are slowly starting to do that,\" Kerr says.</p>\n    <p>\"You see people like me and others appearing on panels at fringe events at conferences.

    "body": "<p>Welcome to the weird world of UK politics 2025.</p>\n<p>The TV presenter Jeremy Kyle announces to a huge crowd of Nigel Farage supporters at Reform UK's party conference that David Lammy is the new number two in government and they boo, panto-style.</p>\n<p>And there's a YouTube video of the (now former) deputy prime minister dancing in a tracksuit and chunky gold chain waving wads of cash that's been watched more than 1.5m times.</p>\n<p>These might both sound like parodies, but only the video of Angela Rayner rapping \"How Many Homes Can Rayner Buy\" was a joke.</p>\n<p>And what was planned as No 10's \"get back in charge week\" has been blown up by a row you couldn't make up – the housing secretary in trouble for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jl43400jo\">not paying tens of thousands of pounds of tax</a> on her expensive new house.</p>\n<p>Her exit pushed the button on a chunky shakeup of Sir Keir Starmer's team.</p>\n<p>The start of this political season has been wild.</p>\n<p>In the end, Rayner's decision to go was clear cut.</p>\n<p>The official report into her behaviour said she'd tried to do the right thing, but not tried hard enough. So the rules had been broken.</p>\n<p>Her camp reckoned she had no option. No 10 agreed.</p>\n<p>There is frustration that the manner of her exit from government gave her critics what they wanted. But she knew she had no choice, and was devastated by her own mistake.</p>\n<p>It's acutely and specifically painful for Labour because Rayner had personally styled herself as something of a sleaze-buster.</p>\n<p>It was she who often led the charge against the succession of Conservatives who got into trouble over their own complicated financial arrangements, hurling accusations of arrogance and greed on a fairly regular basis.</p>\n<p>She was the shoutier end of Starmer's so called \"Mr Rules\" approach, a serious belief that government had to be washed clean of its tawdry image after multiple scandals and Boris Johnson's, <i>ahem</i>, flexible attitude to the normal rules.</p>\n<p>She portrayed herself as a loud and proud champion of ordinary people looking at the worst Westminster behaviour in disgust.</p>\n<p>For Labour in general, it undermines again, their claim to be different to those who went before, to return government to the \"service of the people\", as Sir Keir said so many times – to be competent, with clean heels.</p>\n<p>For the government's number two to have messed up her tax affairs undermines faith in ministers' ability. As one MP put it, \"it's not even a rookie error, it's 40,000 smackers of oversight\".</p>\n<p>And for such a prominent politician to lose their job over property dealings that many of the public couldn't imagine being able to afford gives the impression, again, that politicians live in a different world.</p>\n<p>\"There's just the smell test,\" a Labour insider said.</p>\n<p>This time last year, Rayner, the prime minister himself, and even the chancellor were all red faced for taking, albeit permitted freebies, of clothes, glasses, and gig tickets, struggling to explain why politicians are entitled to free stuff the rest of us are not.</p>\n<p>Twelve months on, Rayner is the fifth minister who has quit after their actions caused embarrassment for the government. Those clean heels look a bit scruffy now.</p>\n<p>The mess is, of course, a gift for Nigel Farage. At his party's conference in Birmingham on Friday Rayner's exit didn't just shove him on stage a few hours early for his speech to try to grab a space in the news cycle, it gave more ammunition to his fundamental argument.</p>\n<p>Reform's pitch rests on a claim that the two big parties are as bad as each other, and preside over a system that is bust.</p>\n<p>Does his vow he could stop the small boats in a fortnight stand up? We've been speaking to the Reform leader, and our full interview will be on the show on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The prime minister's answer to the drama of the last couple of days?</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0veg88g7jyo\">Making changes to his ministers.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>The decisions were made finally because of Rayner's exit but the moves have been long in the making.</p>\n<p>Downing Street's hope is to salvage opportunity out of what was fast morphing into a crisis. A No 10 source tells me: \"None of us expected it to unfold as it did, but this gives real shape and substance to a refreshed No 10 team, marking a strong new phase of this premiership.\"</p>\n<p>You and I might translate that as: \"The saga over Angela's tax was a total pain in the neck, but it's given us the excuse to make some of the changes we fancied anyway.\"</p>\n<p>One insider described it as moving those who were \"a bit awkward, or a bit tired\".</p>\n<p>What those changes add up to depends on who you ask.</p>\n<p>One ally of the PM tells me, the reshuffle \"is all about immigration\", believing \"Shabana [Mahmood] is the one who can get a grip of this\" to solve the small boats issue or \"we're all done for\".</p>\n<p>Some of Starmer's allies have long admired Shabana Mahmood, and believe her elevation to home secretary will bring a more forthright approach to cracking the problems of the immigration system.</p>\n<p>As justice secretary she held out the possibility of castrating sex offenders. That is not exactly a proposal designed to warm the hearts of Labour Party branch meetings.</p>\n<p>But in some government circles there's a hope she'll take a more strident approach to the small boats crisis than Yvette Cooper.</p>\n<p>Cooper moves to a life where she'll spend a lot more time on a plane, as foreign secretary. But those close to her believe it's a tribute to her work doing deals with countries on migration in this last year that she has been given the arguably more prestigious job.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't bet we'll see her <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr68vde7nvo\">meeting JD Vance in waders</a> any time soon. But there is the small matter of a state visit from his boss, President Trump, in a matter of days.</p>\n<p>Different sources point to other appointments as the ones that will make the difference. The government's often stated number one priority has been to get the economy growing. You don't need me to tell you they haven't been having a great time with that.</p>\n<p>Sources suggest moving Pat McFadden, the wily political brain, into a new mega ministry to deal with welfare and skills is part of a souped-up attempt to get the country working, and moving Peter Kyle to business is a way to soothe fevered brows of industry.</p>\n<p>He takes the seat of Jonathan Reynolds, who moves to the vital role of chief whip. Given how many ructions there were on the backbenches last term, despite the party's mega majority, Reynold's fortunes keeping the party on side, or not, will be critical.</p>\n<p>But while the reshuffle was a major set of moves, will it dramatically change what you see from the government that runs the country? Don't expect big swerves.</p>\n<p>This is not a reshuffle that has come about because of some massive ideological bust up. It seems more about the personalities of the ministers involved than any dramatic shifts in Starmer's ambition.</p>\n<p>His allies say in the first year in office he was frustrated at how hard it was to get anything done. The hope is the new line up will work more quickly, and push harder on the government's most thorny problems. One minister said the \"time for incremental change has passed – we don't have long\", conscious all the time of Reform breathing down their neck.</p>\n<p>Will it work? That's what we'll witness as the months unfold. A senior Labour figure told me disappointedly: \"I'm not sure moving personnel is the best thing – the biggest frustration is the lack of project – that's what makes it hard to make day to decisions.\"</p>\n<p>This reshuffle doesn't answer the most frequent complaint made about Sir Keir by his own party, often publicly, that it's just not that clear exactly what he stands for.</p>\n<p>\"Phase 2\" was meant to be \"delivery, delivery, delivery\". Another bout of political jargon that followed, \"change\", \"renewal\", \"security\", \"fairness\", \"milestones\", \"first steps\", you get the point.</p>\n<p>Even some of the PM's allies would admit privately that none of his chosen pitches to the public have made people's hearts sing.</p>\n<p>\"You can see the problem from Mars,\" another party insider says, \"there's not enough political direction of what he wants to do – so the policies don't lather up into anything\", they reckon. That oft-cited problem is not going to be miraculously solved by a set of HR decisions after a huge embarrassment this week.</p>\n<p>But Sir Keir's hope this weekend will be that a reboot at the cabinet table makes his government more effective - demonstrating government can work.</p>\n<p>And convincing the public of that these days would be a significant achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39rk4jlpw7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I remember, at 10, my mum being suicidal and me sleeping like a dog on the end of her bed, just to try and stay next to her so she didn't do any harm to herself,\" Rayner said.</p>\n    <p>She has also recalled going to her grandmother's flat on Sundays, so the family could take it in turns to have a bath there. Hot water was too expensive for them to use at home.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0b5/live/55dde2b0-8a35-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner speaks at a general election campaign event in Manchester on 7 November 2019. She holds her hands out in front of a red screen.\"/>\n    <p>Rayner has often spoken about being told she would \"never amount to anything\", after she left school without any qualifications.</p>\n    <p>But after having her first child at 16, Rayner studied part-time at college, learning British sign language and gaining a vocational qualification in social care.</p>\n    <p>She spent a number of years as a care worker in Stockport, mainly looking after elderly people in their own homes, while also rising quickly through the ranks of the union, Unison.</p>\n    <p>She has described herself as \"mouthy\", someone who would \"take no messing from management\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c7a/live/27e0a200-8a38-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Alamy Angela Rayner with members of Unison and protesters from Save Our Ambulance Service on their way to the Department of Health. They hold a purple sign reading Unison.\"/>\n    <p>In her 20s, she became a full-time union official and eventually, after battles over working conditions and zero-hour contracts, rose to the most senior elected role in Unison in north-west England.</p>\n    <p>It was at Unison she met Mark Rayner, a fellow union official whom she married in 2010 and divorced in 2023. The couple went on to have two sons, one of whom was born so prematurely he is registered blind and has special educational needs.</p>\n    <p>At the age of 37, the mum-of-three became a grandmother, sparking the nickname \"Grangela\".</p>\n    <p>She credits the trade union movement with encouraging her to enter politics and taking her from - in her own words - \"the girl on a council estate\" to \"a woman who feels like she can conquer the world\".</p>\n    <p>Those ambitions started to be realised in 2015, when she was elected as the MP for Ashton-under-Lyne - a seat not far from her hometown. She later said she had only stood to make the point that \"people like me can't get elected\" and had \"accidentally\" won the seat.</p>\n    <h2>The Prescott role</h2>\n    <p>Rayner rose quickly in Westminster, taking up the women and equalities, and education briefs in the shadow cabinet of former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.</p>\n    <p>When Corbyn stood down in 2020, following Labour's worst general election result since 1935, Rayner did not run for the leadership, and backed her ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, who came second to Sir Keir.</p>\n    <p>Instead, Rayner stood for the deputy leadership and won election to that post comfortably - going on to be a central figure in Sir Keir's bid to remake the party.</p>\n    <p>But relations between Sir Keir and Rayner have sometimes been tense. After Labour lost control of eight English councils and lost the seat of Hartlepool in a parliamentary by-election in May 2021, the deputy leader was removed from her post as party chairwoman.</p>\n    <p>She pushed back and was appointed shadow first secretary of state among other titles.</p>\n    <p>By that point, Rayner had a strong support base and a powerful role likened to that of John Prescott, who was seen as a political bridge between the working class and the New Labour project during Tony Blair's premiership.</p>\n    <p>Rayner heavily leaned into that role and tried to use it to her party's advantage in the years before Labour's general election win in 2024.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58ff/live/0a856a50-8a39-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, deputy leader and chairwoman of the Labour Party visit Seaton Carew seafront on 1 May 2021 in Seaton Carew.

A camera shoots a photo, with the beach behind them.\"/>\n    <p>Outspoken and combative at times, Rayner repeatedly accused the Conservatives of being \"out of touch\", and hammered the party with lines such as \"one rule for them and another rule for us\" during the scandal over pandemic parties in Downing Street.</p>\n    <p>Sometimes Rayner admitted she had gone too far, once apologising for describing senior Conservatives as \"a bunch of scum\".</p>\n    <p>Her prominence and the venom of her political attacks had put a target on her back and attracted unwanted headlines.</p>\n    <p>In 2021, Rayner lashed out at \"sexism and misogyny\" in politics, after a newspaper reported that she crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson.</p>\n    <p>And in 2024, she was investigated by the police over the tax paid on the sale of her council house, again following a slew of reports by unfriendly newspapers, cheered on by the Conservatives.

    "body": "<p>Angela Rayner has resigned as deputy prime minister, housing secretary and the deputy leader of the Labour Party, after admitting <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c0lk8ye1979t\">she underpaid tax after buying a flat in Hove</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is her resignation letter in full, along with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's response and a letter from Sir Laurie Magnus, the independent adviser on ministerial ethics, in which he sets out that Rayner breached the ministerial code.</p>\n<h2>Rayner's resignation letter</h2>\n<p>Dear Keir,</p>\n<p>Thank you for the personal and public support you have shown me in recent days. As you know, on Wednesday I referred myself to your Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, to conduct a thorough investigation into my personal financial circumstances after I became aware that it is likely I inadvertently paid the incorrect rate for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).</p>\n<p>I have always taken my responsibilities as Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as a Member of Parliament with the utmost seriousness. I have long believed that people who serve the British public in government must always observe the highest standards, and while the Independent Adviser has concluded that I acted in good faith and with honesty and integrity throughout, I accept that I did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.</p>\n<p>I deeply regret my decision to not seek additional specialist tax advice given both my position as Housing Secretary and my complex family arrangements. I take full responsibility for this error. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat that it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount.</p>\n<p>I must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family. While I rightly expect proper scrutiny on me and my life, my family did not choose to have their private lives interrogated and exposed so publicly. I have been clear throughout this process that my priority has, and always will be, protecting my children and the strain I am putting them under through staying in post has become unbearable.</p>\n<p>Given the findings, and the impact on my family, I have therefore decided to resign as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>\n<p>For a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport to serve as the highest level of government has been the honour of my life. The challenges of government are nothing compared to the challenge of putting food on the table and getting a roof over our head when I brought up kids working as a home help. Too many people face the same across our country.</p>\n<p>I've always known that politics changes lives because it changed mine. The last Labour government gave me the tools I needed to build a better life for me and my young son, and that's why I've been working relentlessly from day one in government to do the same for the next generation. Every day I had in office, I worked to serve working class communities like the one that I grew up in, which are too often overlooked by those in power. I am proud that in every decision I made, I did it for them. I would never have become Deputy Prime Minister if not for the decisions taken by the last Labour Government, giving me a council house to support me, Sure Start to help raise my kids, and the security of a minimum wage - and I can only hope that the changes I made in government will have the same impact for young girls growing up on council estates like I did.</p>\n<p>Through my Employment Rights Bill people across the country will receive the biggest uplift in workers' rights in a generation. This landmark legislation will be game changing for millions of people stuck in insecure and low-paid work, giving them the dignity and security they don't just need but also deserve. I am and will remain deeply proud of that legacy. I am so proud to have worked alongside the trade union movement, who have given me everything, to deliver that.</p>\n<p>Our Renters' Rights Bill will finally ban the oppressive rule of no-fault evictions and will reset the balance between renters and landlords through ground breaking protection for renters. Everyone deserves to live in a safe and decent home, and I know this legislation will deliver that for millions of people across the country.</p>\n<p>The Planning and Infrastructure Bill will also be instrumental in getting the homes so many people across this country need built, and I am so proud that at the Spending Review we announced the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation with the overwhelming amount of this going to genuinely social rent homes.</p>\n<p>And last week, I introduced the English Devolution Bill to Parliament. The largest single package of devolution from any Westminster government to local people across England. This landmark legislation will permanently change the balance of power, giving true control to those with skin in game. We delivered an Elections Strategy which will mean 16 and 17 year olds getting the vote for the first time, as well as ambitious plans to ensure the most marginalised communities are registered to vote. We took steps to stabilise the broken foundations of local government and deliver the first genuinely fair funding review and the first multi-year settlement for a decade.</p>\n<p>My department, through my excellent team of Ministers, has also provided the largest ever investment in homelessness prevention services to local authorities, to get Britain back on track to ending homelessness for good. We've worked relentlessly to bring an end to the building safety crisis and developed new measures to get peoples' homes fixed quicker and hold rogue freeholders to account. We've also worked to boost community cohesion, tackle hate crime and reset the relationship with faith communities.</p>\n<p>I have been lucky to work alongside the most talented group of Ministers who worked with dedication to deliver for working people. I thank Matthew Pennycook, Jim McMahon, Alex Norris, Wajid Khan and Sharon Taylor. I too am grateful to my brilliant parliamentary team, Harpreet Uppal, Mark Ferguson, and Gen Kitchen.</p>\n<p>For me, being in office is the chance to change the lives of the people I grew up alongside. I will do whatever I can to continue doing so.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your leadership and for your friendship. I will continue to serve you, our country and the party and movement I love in the weeks, months and years ahead.</p>\n<p>Yours sincerely,</p>\n<p>The Rt. Hon. Angela Rayner MP Representing Ashton-under-Lyne, Audenshaw, Droylsden and Dukinfield Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government</p>\n<h2>Sir Keir's reply to Rayner</h2>\n<p>Dear Angela,</p>\n<p>Thank you for informing me of your decision to resign from the Government. I am very sad that your time as Deputy prime Minister, Secretary of State and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party has ended in this way.</p>\n<p>As you know we acted in accordance with the strengthened system relating to ministerial conduct that we put in place on coming into Government. You were right to refer yourself to the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards and right to act on his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Although I believe you have reached the right decision, it is a decision which I know is very painful for you. You have given your all to making the Labour Government a success and you have been a central part of our plan to make Britain fairer for working families. Your work at MHCLG to help build the homes that Britain needs has been hugely important and your work to create more fairness in the workplace through the Employment Rights Bill represents a very significant achievement that will change the lives of millions of people.</p>\n<p>On a personal note, I am very sad to be losing you from the Government. You have been a trusted colleague and a true friend for many years. I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievement in politics. I know that many people of all political persuasions admire that someone as talented as you is the living embodiment of social mobility.</p>\n<p>Even though you won't be part of the Government, you will remain a major figure in our party. I know that you will continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about.</p>\n<p>My very best wishes, and with real sadness,</p>\n<p>Keir</p>\n<h2>Ethics adviser's letter to PM on Rayner's conduct</h2>\n<p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>\n<p>Following a self-referral by The Rt Hon Angela Rayner MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government on 3 September 2025, I have undertaken an examination of the circumstances and facts connected to recent allegations about Ms Rayner's property ownership and tax affairs.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyn051990o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>On 3 October 2021, Reform UK held its first conference - a modest one-day get-together in Manchester - only a short distance from the much larger Conservative Party gathering, taking place nearby at the city's Convention Complex at the same time.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>At the Reform event, only a few hundred activists were present in the function room - and Nigel Farage, not yet party leader, was reportedly not among them. Reform was polling around 3% and had won just two councillors in that May's local elections.</p>\n<p>What a difference four years makes.</p>\n<p>Reform's annual conference takes place this weekend in Birmingham, with 5,500 tickets reportedly already sold. It is thought that one in five of the nation's lobbyists will be there too. The party has now been ahead in the polls for five months.</p>\n<p>Never before has a party other than Conservative or Labour been ahead in the polls for so long. Indeed, since the party's success in English local elections in May, it has consistently been averaging 30% to 31%, enough to put it well ahead of all its rivals.</p>\n<p>Recent attempts by YouGov and More in Common to estimate what the party's support might mean in terms of MPs suggest that if an election were held now, Reform would be the largest party by far, albeit probably short of an overall majority. At the moment, Nigel Farage - now firmly in place as Reform's leader - appears potentially on course to become the UK's next prime minister.</p>\n<p>The question hanging over the party is - can they sustain this?</p>\n<p>The next general election could be almost four years away. Much could happen between now and then. A year into the last parliament the Conservatives were narrowly ahead in the polls – only to crash to a heavy defeat in last summer's election.</p>\n<p>But what could make a difference – one way or the other – to Reform's prospects? Analysis of who is - and who is not - backing the party, and why, provides us with vital clues.</p>\n<p>So too does an understanding of the broader UK political landscape, one in which a fragmentation of the vote away from the main parties is offering Reform an unprecedented opportunity.</p>\n<h2>A plague on both their houses?</h2>\n<p>Support for Reform might be thought to be simply a protest vote by an electorate fed up with slow growth, an ailing health service, and high levels of immigration. If so, the party's popularity would seem likely to wane should the country's prospects look brighter in four years.</p>\n<p>Dissatisfaction with the state of the country certainly underpins support for Reform. For example, according to Ipsos, 68% of voters feel that the economy will get worse over the next year, up from 43% at the time of last year's election and as high as it has ever been a year into a new Parliament. Among those whose current party preference is Reform, a remarkable 89% are pessimistic about the prospects for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the most recent British Social Attitudes survey, conducted last autumn, showed that a record 59% are dissatisfied with the NHS. Among those who voted Reform last year, the figure is even higher – 69%.</p>\n<p>Most voters think that immigration is too high. An Opinium poll in August found that 71% feel that way. But nearly everyone who is now backing Reform (97%) expresses that view.</p>\n<p>Reform supporters have little confidence in the ability of either Labour's leader, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, or the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, to address these issues. Most lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to handle the economy, the NHS, and immigration. However, at the same time, on balance their judgement of Badenoch's abilities is a negative one too.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Reform supporters have even less confidence than Conservative supporters in Sir Keir's abilities. At the same time, Reform supporters have less confidence than Labour supporters in Badenoch's capabilities.</p>\n<p>For example, 58% of Conservatives lack confidence in Sir Keir's ability to turn the economy around – well short of the 76% of Reform supporters who express that view. Meanwhile, 40% of Labour supporters doubt that Badenoch can tackle the economy, less than the 47% figure among Reform supporters.</p>\n<h2>A powerful magnet</h2>\n<p>Reform supporters seem to have lost faith in the ability of either of Britain's two traditional governing parties to address the country's most pressing problems.</p>\n<p>In contrast, they do have confidence in Farage. This is especially so for immigration, but he also scores well on the economy and the NHS.</p>\n<p>Among those currently backing Reform, 84% approve of the job Farage is doing – far higher than the equivalent figure for Sir Keir among Labour supporters (62%) or Badenoch (46%) among Conservatives.</p>\n<p>While Farage is not so widely admired in the wider population, his ratings among voters in general still compare favourably with those of his rivals.</p>\n<p>In Opinium's most recent poll, for example, rather more say they disapprove (40%) than approve (30%) of how Farage is handling his job as Reform leader. But that still means that more approve of the job he is doing than approve of Sir Keir (21%) or Badenoch (16%).</p>\n<p>The Reform leader is proving a powerful magnet that is attracting discontented voters into his party's camp.</p>\n<p>The party's future prospects seemingly rest heavily on Farage remaining its leader. The party might struggle to keep its support if Farage departed the political scene. At the same time, voters might drift away if the country's prospects improve under Labour or if Badenoch can persuade them that she and her party have better solutions than Farage.</p>\n<h2>The Brexit factor</h2>\n<p>Politicians do not talk much about Brexit these days. Yet, Brexit is a major fault line that sharply distinguishes those who do and do not support Reform. The party's support stands at no less than 53% among those who voted Leave in 2016. In contrast, just 11% of those who backed Remain are to be found in the ranks of current Reform supporters.</p>\n<p>But to misquote a former prime minister, Brexit means more than Brexit. Those who voted Leave in 2016 have distinctive views on a range of so-called cultural issues.</p>\n<p>They are especially concerned about immigration, they are doubtful about many equalities policies, and they are more inclined to be sceptical about climate change.</p>\n<p>These views are widely prevalent among those currently inclined to vote for Reform but are often out of kilter with the population as a whole.</p>\n<p>According to the latest British Social Attitudes survey, 81% of those who voted Reform last year believe that migrants have undermined rather than enriched the country's culture. Equally 73% feel that migrants have been bad for the country's economy. These figures are very different from those among voters in general, just 31% of whom believe that migration has undermined Britain's culture, and only 32% feel it has been bad for the economy.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, 53% of Reform voters believe that attempts to give equal opportunities for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals have \"gone too far\". Some 49% say the same of equal opportunities for black and Asian people, while 71% express that view in the case of transgender people. The equivalent figures among the general public are 33%, 18% and 50% respectively.</p>\n<p>Only 33% of Reform voters believe that climate change is being caused mainly by human activity, far fewer than the 54% figure among the public in general. As many as 25% state that the climate is largely changing as a result of natural processes, a view shared by just 8% of all voters. Reform voters are less supportive than other voters of virtually any measure designed to address climate change.</p>\n<p>Opposition to immigration, equal opportunities policies, and climate change measures feature prominently in Reform's campaigning – which often cites spending on these issues as alleged examples of government waste. Indeed, Reform voters are noticeably less keen on government spending too. Only one in four (25%) believe taxes should be increased in order to spend more on \"health, education and social benefits\", much lower than the 46% of all voters who take that view.</p>\n<p>The party is singing a tune that is widely popular among the many Brexiteers who have been recruited into the ranks of its supporters.</p>\n<p>Doing so has enabled the party to capture much of the coalition of Leave voters that gave Boris Johnson his mandate in 2019 to deliver Brexit. The Conservatives lost one in four of their 2019 supporters to Reform at the last election - and now, on top of that, Badenoch's party has lost another three in 10 of those who were still loyal to the Conservatives last year. In total, that means half of those who voted for Johnson in 2019 are now backing Farage.</p>\n<p>Consequently, support for the Conservatives among 2016 Leave voters (23%) is only a little higher now than among Remain supporters (14%). In 2019, 75% of Leave voters (and just 20% of Remainers) backed Johnson.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy853rj2kzo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Well, the chancellor did not rule out welfare cuts, even after the remarkable U-turn on disability benefits in July.</p>\n    <p>She may also be a hostage to fortune in the promise that the Budget will help bring inflation, currently at 3.8%, down.</p>\n    <p>Many typical measures aimed to raise revenue push it up, and that was the experience last year.</p>\n    <p>Even as she was asserting control over this crucial Budget process, the bond markets reminded her that they can be just as powerful.</p>\n    <p>She may well find the message useful in managing her own internal scrappy politics.</p>\n    <p>It's going to be a rough ride to 26 November.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn76ly476x6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He is standing outside, with a woman holding a red sign and a large building in the background. He is wearing a dark jacket and shirt. \"/>\n    <p>Sometimes the left of Scottish politics can feel like a crowded place.</p>\n    <p>You have the SNP, Labour and the Scottish Greens all claiming to be the natural home for voters who are that way inclined.</p>\n    <p>And that's before you even get into a variety of smaller parties.</p>\n    <p>And now there's (potentially) a new player on the scene – Jeremy Corbyn's latest project.</p>\n    <p>It's not got a permanent name yet, but it's currently calling itself Your Party. And it's being launched with the support of another former Labour MP, Zarah Sultana.</p>\n    <p>Corbyn has said that he fancies his chances in Scotland.</p>\n    <p>He made that comment on a recent visit to Glasgow, where he joined striking workers on a picket line.</p>\n    <p>There was plenty of enthusiasm there for the former Labour leader.</p>\n    <p>But is there space for this party to make a breakthrough at the Holyrood election next year?</p>\n    <p>That's a difficult assessment to make at this point.</p>\n    <p>We don't have any Scotland specific polling on how Your Party is being received by the public here.</p>\n    <p>A couple of Britain-wide polls have put support for the new project at 6% and 4%.</p>\n    <p>That's hardly a political earthquake, but it does show the party is making some sort of impact.</p>\n    <p>Other polls have produced higher results when the option of \"a new left-wing party\" is included. But this is a slightly vaguer way of phrasing it that pollsters tend to be more sceptical about.</p>\n    <p>What we can't say at this point is how this party could perform in a Holyrood election – we simply don't have the data.</p>\n    <p>The polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice says that research has shown Scotland is slightly more left-wing than England, so perhaps there is scope for a breakthrough?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d28/live/3a746d70-8808-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Ross Greer, a ginger man with glasses, smiles at the camera. He is wearing a blue jacket and white t-shirt. \"/>\n    <p>That's echoed by another pollster, Mark Diffley.</p>\n    <p>He says that Scotland's more proportional voting system for Holyrood means there is potentially a gap for a new \"radical left\" movement.</p>\n    <p>And he points to the Scottish Greens as the party who could be most at risk of leaking votes.</p>\n    <p>Ross Greer, a new co-leader of the Scottish Greens, insists that anyone who wants \"to build a more socialist Scotland is a friend and an ally\".</p>\n    <p>But he adds that he believes his party has the strongest track record of delivering MSPs who fit this mould.</p>\n    <h2>Is Corbyn popular in Scotland?</h2>\n    <p>It is far from certain that Your Party will get any kind of foothold in Scottish politics.</p>\n    <p>Jeremy Corbyn may be a big name, but Mark Diffley says there is little to suggest he has personally captured the imagination of the Scottish electorate.</p>\n    <p>\"He is a figure who doesn't have a history of being particularly popular in Scotland,\" Mr Diffley told BBC Scotland News. \"I don't think he's said much about Scottish politics in the past.\"</p>\n    <p>And while Corbyn had a better than expected result leading Labour in 2017, his share of the vote was much lower in Scotland compared to England and Wales.</p>\n    <p>But there are still some who think this new left party could be what Scottish politics needs.</p>\n    <p>Neil Findlay was a Labour MSP once upon a time. He <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp3yp3l175do\">recently left the party</a> over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on benefits.</p>\n    <p>He now runs a public affairs firm that focuses on progressive causes.</p>\n    <p>His West Lothian office walls make his politics clear: there is a quote from the famous Labour left-winger Tony Benn, various bits of trade union paraphernalia and - you guessed it - a Jeremy Corbyn poster.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0c57/live/f678ab50-8806-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images A group of people holding Reform signs and banners line up behind a large flag. There man with a Reform sign and a labrador dog with a Reform rosette in the foreground, and a large Reform billboard in the background. \"/>\n    <p>Neil Findlay thinks Your Party could secure backing from more surprising quarters - Reform supporters.</p>\n    <p>The former MSP says that those inclined to back Nigel Farage's party are not necessarily right-wing.</p>\n    <p>He explains that he sees them as frustrated people \"looking for an avenue for their vote because they see the mainstream parties as having let them down\".</p>\n    <p>He is not currently involved with Jeremy Corbyn's new project, but he urged the party to get up and running for the Holyrood election next May, calling this \"the big opportunity\".</p>\n    <p>But does this project not run the risk of splitting the left-wing vote and ultimately making life easier for parties on the right?</p>\n    <p>Mr Findlay says that's an argument deployed by parties \"who are very afraid that their vote is in decline and that some new kid on the block could start to muscle in on their territory\".</p>\n    <h2>The independence question</h2>\n    <p>An obvious question for any new party in Scotland is what stance do they take on independence?</p>\n    <p>Jeremy Corbyn is relaxed about the idea of a second referendum, having recently told BBC Scotland News that if voters want one \"that's fine by me\".</p>\n    <p>But it is not entirely clear if his party is explicitly taking a stance on whether or not it ultimately backs independence.</p>\n    <p>Your Party still has a lot of work to do. After all, it does not even have a final name yet.</p>\n    <p>Some sort of conference to formalise the movement is expected later this year, though the clock is ticking when it comes to next May's Holyrood vote.</p>\n    <p>There could be some sort of space for Jeremy Corbyn's latest party to occupy in Scotland.</p>\n    <p>But if they're to get any sort of foothold in that election, they really have to move fast.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxyxpnzzx0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

<p>Zack Polanski has stormed to victory in the Green Party leadership election on a platform promising bold communication and \"eco-populism\".</p>\n    <p>The new leader said he would now \"take the fight to Labour\", telling Sir Keir Starmer's party: \"We are here to replace you.\"</p>\n    <p>While he's made a name for himself as a feisty media performer among the party faithful, he's little known outside the London Assembly, where he is an elected member.</p>\n    <p>Beating two of the party's four MPs to the leadership, the 42-year-old has already faced down the charge that he doesn't have the establishment heft of those elected to Parliament in a first-past-the-post system.</p>\n    <p>His pitch to the membership was to move away from the tried-and-tested, with a decisive shunt to the left and a more confrontational communication style.</p>\n    <p>Polanski has had an unconventional path to politics, previously working as an actor, hypnotherapist and mental health counsellor.</p>\n    <p>A 2013 article in the Sun that still dogs him involved a reporter, who posed as a client, claiming he helped her to boost her bust through the power of thought.</p>\n    <p>Asked about the piece following his win, Polanski said his time as a Harley Street hypnotherapist pre-dated any of his political ambitions and he had immediately apologised.</p>\n    <p>\"We are all more than one mistake,\" he said, adding that Labour was \"terrified\" of his popularity if they were \"rifling through stories from a long time ago where I was clearly misrepresented\".</p>\n    <p>Born in 1982, Polanski grew up in Salford, heading to university in Aberystwyth, in Wales, before ending up in Hackney, east London.</p>\n    <p>He is gay and also Jewish, changing his name from David Paulden when he reached 18 in order to embrace the identity erased by his family's anglicised surname, as well as to differentiate himself from his stepdad, who had the same first name.</p>\n    <p>His first foray into politics was joining the Liberal Democrats, a party he now criticises as being insufficiently left-wing, and standing unsuccessfully for Camden Council and the London Assembly.</p>\n    <p>He joined the Greens in 2017, working as a local party chairman before getting elected to City Hall in 2021 and becoming the party's deputy leader in 2022.</p>\n    <p>As deputy leader, Polanski has played a role in the party's growing electoral success.</p>\n    <p>In last year's general election, the Greens quadrupled their number of MPs to four, with his leadership rivals Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns among those joining Parliament.</p>\n    <p>Caroline Lucas had been the party's sole MP for 14 years, before standing down at last year's election, and she had thrown her weight behind the Ramsay-Chowns joint ticket.</p>\n    <p>While Ramsay and Chowns have been seen as continuity candidates, Polanski wants to move away from the \"stats and spreadsheets\" style, promising a mass-membership \"eco-populist\" movement that connects with voters on an emotional level.</p>\n    <p>Key to that approach is Polanski's approval of Nigel Farage's \"storytelling\" skills, which he told BBC Newsnight could be harnessed to send a different message to a wider audience, including Reform UK supporters.</p>\n    <p>He said the Greens had to \"connect with that anger and turn it to hope, turn it to possible solutions\".</p>\n    <p>In his \"eco-populism\" leadership pitch he has linked the climate crisis to inequality and called for radical action, \"not briefcase politics\", to fix unfair systems.</p>\n    <p>He has promised to lower bills with green energy and nationalised water companies, while also taking the \"fight\" to Labour, particularly on inequality.</p>\n    <p>The battle on inequality includes his longstanding support for a Universal Basic Income, a small, non-means-tested payment for everyone that covers basic needs.</p>\n    <p>As a former property guardian and long-time renter, Polanski has also campaigned for decent, warm homes for everyone.</p>\n    <p>He has called for the government to take action on what he describes as the genocide in Gaza, as well as being arrested for his activism with environmental protest group Extinction Rebellion.</p>\n    <p>His election potentially opens the door to cooperation with the new party <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdeze706jw8o\">being set up by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana</a>.</p>\n    <p>The arrival of a new left-wing party, headed by Corbyn, threatens to take a chunk out of the Green Party's support, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/one-five-britons-would-consider-voting-new-left-wing-party-rising-one-three-young-people-and-labour\">polls suggest</a>. </p>\n    <p>But unlike some in the Greens, Polanski views the new party as an opportunity rather than a threat.</p>\n    <p>He has spoken about forging a new \"Green left\" and of collaborating with Corbyn on policy, although he has stopped short of proposing a formal electoral pact, saying it is \"too soon\".</p>\n    <p>This is a potential headache for Sir Keir, as he battles to hold on to left-wing voters, many of whom had already deserted Labour for the Greens at the last election.</p>\n    <p>Being bold and radical does not come without risk, as Chowns and Ramsay, who were both elected to Parliament in previously Tory areas, had been keen to point out during the campaign.</p>\n    <p>Jettisoning the careful calibration both those MPs managed to balance to win half the party's Westminster seats from the Conservatives could leave them, and the 3,705 Green members who voted for them, out in the cold.</p>\n    <p>Polanski sought to address these concerns in his victory speech, saying: \"To those of you who didn't vote for me, this is a democracy. We don't have to agree on everything. We just have to have common cause.\"</p>\n    <p>But the four Green MPs will now have to elect one of their number to lead their group in the Commons, setting up another potential source of tension.</p>\n    <p>Because of the way the Green Party is structured, with a leadership election every two years, members will get a chance to give their verdict on Polanski's new direction well before the next general election, due in 2029.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6fad/live/133a6af0-dc98-11ef-bc01-8f2c83dad217.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Get the latest political analysis and big moments, delivered straight to your inbox every weekday”.

It is a violation of international law for an occupier to settle its citizens on the land it has taken.</p>\n<p>Last year, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory that said the entire occupation was illegal.</p>\n<p>But the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is hungry for more settlements.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, the defence minister Israel Katz and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that 22 new settlements would be built in the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Katz said the massive expansion, the biggest in decades, was making a \"strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel and serves as a buffer against our enemies\" .</p>\n<p>\"This is a Zionist, security, and national response - and a clear decision on the future of the country,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Next to Katz was the ultra-nationalist leader Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in a settlement in the West Bank and believes that the land was given to the Jews by God. He is finance minister but also is effectively the governor of the West Bank with sweeping powers over planning.</p>\n<p>Smotrich called the settlement expansion a \"once-in-a-generation decision\" and declared: \"Next step sovereignty!\"</p>\n<p>Everyone in Israel, and the Palestinians in the territories, know that when Smotrich and his allies say \"sovereignty\" they mean annexation.</p>\n<p>Smotrich wants all the land for Jews and has openly discussed finding ways of removing Palestinians.</p>\n<h2>'We were very, very scared'</h2>\n<p>On hilltop after hilltop in the West Bank are settlements at different stages of their development, from well-established small towns with mature gardens and schools, to outposts with handful of caravans and a militant population of young settlers who often mix religion with extreme Jewish nationalism, firearms and sometimes deadly aggression towards their Palestinian neighbours.</p>\n<p>Statistics collected by the UN and peace campaigners show that violent settlers have increased attacks on their Palestinian neighbours since the 7 October attacks.</p>\n<p>I went to see how that has affected Taybeh, an entirely Christian village of around 1,500 people.</p>\n<p>It is a quiet place that seems to have many more houses than residents. After nearly six hard decades of Israeli occupation, more Taybeh people have been forced to emigrate than now live in the village.</p>\n<p>Two nights before the visit, settlers entered the village when most people were in bed. They burned Kamal Tayea's car and tried unsuccessfully to get into his new house, part of a pleasant development overlooking acres of olive groves. They daubed the walls with graffiti in Hebrew sprayed with red paint.</p>\n<p>Kamal, a middle-aged man reassessing whether his decision to move his family to the edge of the village was wise, is installing a network of security cameras.</p>\n<p>\"We were very, very scared,\" Kamal said. \"I have children and an old mum. Our lives were threatened, and it was terrifying.\"</p>\n<p>I asked him whether Britain's plan to recognise Palestine would make his life any easier.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so. It's a big step to have a superpower like Britain support us, but on the ground, it does not change much. Israel is not compliant with any international resolutions or laws.</p>\n<p>\"It does not listen to any other country in the whole world.\"</p>\n<h2>'Our roots are here. We can't move'</h2>\n<p>During the next night, Jewish settlers raided neighbouring Palestinian communities, burning cars and spraying graffiti. It is more than just vandalism.</p>\n<p>The settlers want the Palestinians out and, in some places in the occupied territories, have succeeded, forcing Palestinians in remote villages out of their farms and stealing their livestock.</p>\n<p>The Greek Orthodox priest, 74-year-old David Khoury was born in Taybeh. In his church he told me that settlers who have threatened him and other residents are often armed.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, they have guns… they'll use them if we argue with them. They want us out, they want us to leave.\"</p>\n<p>The old priest was defiant.</p>\n<p>\"We are here, since Jesus Christ, 2,000 years. Our roots are here. We can't move. We will not move, even if we die here, we will not move from here… Palestine is inside our blood, how we can live without our blood?\"</p>\n<h2>'If you really seek two states, recognise [both]'</h2>\n<p>It was not many miles to Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital of the West Bank, but I wasn't able to get there in person. Israel's checkpoints can make driving back to Jerusalem slow and difficult, so I reached Husam Zomlot via Zoom. He is the head of the Palestinian delegation to the United Kingdom, effectively their ambassador in London. He is back home for the summer and was delighted by Britain's plan to recognise Palestine.</p>\n<p>\"It is a sign that the UK and with it, the rest of the international community are really serious about the two-state solution. We are no longer in the business of the lip service that has lost us three decades. Actually, if you really seek two states, recognise the two states.\"</p>\n<p>\"We see the recognition as the starting gun to a sprint towards implementing and establishing the state of Palestine and fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\"</p>\n<p>Zomlot was jubilant. It was, he said, a first step, and Britain's decision would make a real difference.</p>\n<p>History is one of the powerful drivers of this conflict. Britain, he added, was atoning at last for the wrongs it had done Palestinians when it was the imperial power here between 1917 and 1948.</p>\n<p>He was referring to the promises made in a short, typewritten letter, dated 2 November 1917, signed by the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of Britain's Jewish community. It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p>\n<p>Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p>\n<p>It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p>\n<p>He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p>\n<p>At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p>\n<p>At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p>\n<p>Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East. He is not in a position to punish us, and it definitely will not bring peace.\"</p>\n<p>\"And it's against justice, history, religion, culture... he's giving a huge reward for Yahya Sinwar [the Hamas leader who led the 7 October attacks and was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year].</p>\n<p>\"Wherever he is in hell today, he sees what Keir Starmer says - and says, 'good partner'.\"</p>\n<p>Back in Taybeh, I had asked a group of leading local citizens who were drinking coffee with the mayor in his office what they thought of the UK's recognition plan.</p>\n<p>One of them, a local businessman, said: \"Thank you Britain. But it's too late.\"</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Top image: Getty Images</i>\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6n0eeqp54o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

You might think the answer should be obvious.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\"This government should be walking on water, there should be nothing it can't do,\" a Whitehall insider suggests, given the rows and rows and rows - and yes, rows - of Labour MPs who line up behind the prime minister every Wednesday.</p>\n<p>But, by booting out a small band of backbenchers this week, Sir Keir Starmer's put the question of his authority back on the table.</p>\n<p>Answering the question of who is in charge isn't so simple after all.</p>\n<p>This government has a \"backbench they - and we - are surprised to discover they can't control,\" says one senior official.</p>\n<p>The financial markets are breathing down its neck, with the country's debts sky high, and for good measure, what a No 10 source describes as a \"deep current of instability\" around the world.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's next one-to-one meeting with President Donald Trump is a case in point – who knows what he will or won't say alongside the prime minister on Scottish soil next week?</p>\n<p>No-one in government can be sure how that is going to shake down, although I was very definitively told we will not be seeing Sir Keir swinging a club with his transatlantic pal.</p>\n<p>It is, of course, impossible for any administration to be the master of all it surveys. But convincingly displaying authority, inhabiting its power, is a different task.</p>\n<p>And neither all of Sir Keir's MPs, nor all of the people inside the government are sure it's being met.</p>\n<h2>Backbench bust-ups</h2>\n<p>Let's start with the prime minister kicking out four MPs this week after they had objected to various Labour plans and proposals.</p>\n<p>But if Sir Keir really felt in control of his party, why did he need to bother about a group of MPs that wouldn't even fill a family saloon? And why did he do it, just days before accepting some of the logic of one of those he kicked out, Chris Hinchliff, over tweaks to proposed planning laws?</p>\n<p>Bemused? You wouldn't be the only one.</p>\n<p>Sir Keir's allies say he always believed there would have to be repercussions for MPs who plot against the government repeatedly, in part because others are asked to defend decisions that might be unpopular or difficult.</p>\n<p>So after the welfare fiasco, the whips were asked to make a list of those who had been actively trying to organise resistance to government plans, rather than just expressing objections.</p>\n<p>After gathering evidence about MPs' behaviour, those four were then shown the door, at least for now, to exert discipline over the backbenches.</p>\n<p>A senior government figure said: \"You can have as big a majority as you want, but if you have no discipline whatsoever it can get chaotic. You can't get chaotic at a time when the country desperately needs its government to get on with things.\"</p>\n<p>It was a separate decision to suspend Diane Abbott - again, a choice made by Labour HQ who felt it had no choice but to act, interpreting her comments as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwye24vjnn8o\">repeating a claim that Jewish people don't experience racism in the same way as black people.</a></p>\n<p>So, \"behave - or else\", is the message to the rest of the backbenches, just when they are about to leave Westminster.</p>\n<p>But have the moves this week made a difference? One senior MP said: \"A lot of people keep wondering, 'Is Keir beholden to his back benches?' I don't think people are like, 'Oh we're going to rebel if we're unhappy all the time'. But there has to be more respect for MPs who are actually out talking to their constituents.\"</p>\n<p>Another senior Labour figure told me, \"No 10 was completely spooked by what happened over welfare – I don't think backbenchers are running it, but they do have a taste for power.\"</p>\n<h2>Are ministers the masters?</h2>\n<p>Who then, is really in charge, I ask a member of the government. They laugh, and say, \"I don't have an answer\".</p>\n<p>The same question posed to another Whitehall figure: \"There is no way of knowing,\" they respond, suggesting sometimes government, even 12 months in, feels chaotic, with contradictory instructions to officials being given, even on the same day.</p>\n<p>It's no secret, and it's not surprising, that working out how to run a country when you haven't done it before is hard.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of ministers and staffers who will of course say loyally that No 10 is now firmly in control after understandable teething troubles, who are also somewhat fed up with the noises off.</p>\n<p>As one government source reckons, \"a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss\". Another insider believes Whitehall is working much better than before. \"In the first six months they were disappointed in us, and we were disappointed with them\".</p>\n<p>The Spending Review process occupied huge amounts of time and effort across government. Now that is over, it's not just the government's purse strings that have been set, but the political priorities alongside. In theory, as that source suggests, \"they are now starting to get on with the doing\".</p>\n<p>But that optimism is not springing from every source.</p>\n<p>One experienced senior official told me: \"A government is in charge if it has a plan, but if it doesn't, it cedes that. They still don't really have a governing plan, so it feels like the PM is in charge, but it is hard for his writ to be made to work.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, it's clearer now, particularly after the big review of spending, what the government wants to do, but not how they plan to do it.</p>\n<p>Another senior figure said: \"They're busy and exhausted going to meetings with each other, and producing documents that no-one ever reads, and conversations that don't lead to anything and telling each other how difficult it is – they don't inhabit their power.\"</p>\n<p>And there's obvious frustration among the government's own members too, one warning of a passive attitude among some colleagues, who could get to the next election and think only, \"Well, I enjoyed driving around in my ministerial car and having my red box\". There is a feeling, like, \"Oh, we are here just to manage, not to lead and drive, and that's not good enough\".</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, one cabinet minister defended the operation, \"It's only been a year, people focus on the problems, if you look at it in the round we have been very, very effective,\" they told me.</p>\n<p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0mn7gmpplo#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20the%20Off%20Air%20with%20Laura%20K%20newsletter%20to%20get%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%27s%20expert%20insight%20and%20insider%20stories%20every%20week%2C%20emailed%20directly%20to%20you.\">Off Air with Laura K</a> newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n<p>Governments are, of course, never short on helpful advice. As well as No 10's own learning on the job, and plans to improve its operations, like a review of communications across government that is under way, there will be other more formal suggestions in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Later in the summer a set of proposals will be published by a think-tank with close links to No 10 and Labour, the Future Governance Forum, that's chaired by the former senior civil servant, Helen MacNamara.</p>\n<p>The review will recommend a new government department, called \"Downing Street\", to give this and future prime ministers a more powerful centre of government so that No 10 can make decisions more quickly, and execute its plans more effectively.</p>\n<p>Government insiders may not have appetite for any big bang changes, although they have pledged themselves on many occasions to \"rewire\" the government.</p>\n<p>The respected Institute for Government already warned this week that big changes were needed if \"ministers were serious\" about their promise to rewire the state, concluding in its own research that Sir Keir's notion of \"mission driven government\" looks \"shaky\", and that government departments had reverted to old habits.</p>\n<p>Moving desks and chairs around Whitehall, whether creating new departments or axing the old, wouldn't exactly make the pulse of the public quicken, but perhaps it ought to be on the agenda for a government that has struggled sometimes to exert its will.</p>\n<h2>The mighty markets</h2>\n<p>If ministers' grip isn't as tight as it might be, and backbenchers aren't calling the shots, there is no doubt there's another huge controlling factor.</p>\n<p>A senior Labour source tells me, \"People like to boil this down to palace politics,\" the jockeying for power between politicians, or the competing beliefs inside the party.</p>\n<p>Surely not, Westminster enjoying a soap opera about the battle for the party's soul?</p>\n<p>But instead they argue, \"The markets are fundamentally a really major part of it – the government isn't making challenging decisions because it enjoys annoying people, or making life hard\".</p>\n<p>It's true the fights inside and outside the government are so often driven by cash sloshing around or falling down the back of the sofa.</p>\n<p>Spoiler, overall spending is enormous but Rachel Reeves keeps a very tight grip on her wallet.</p>\n<p>By instinct, Labour politicians normally want public spending to be generous.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxwe3g4wl5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

After days of frenzied coverage in Westminster around an anniversary the party might rather forget, what is the state of that vital relationship?</p>\n    <p>We gathered a group of Labour's 2024 voters together to delve into what's gone wrong, according to those who matter the most – the public.</p>\n    <p>Our participants were from two constituencies in Kent: Dartford and Gravesham. Both seats were won by Labour in the heady days of July 2024, thanks not only to Labour's campaign itself, but the collapse of the Conservative vote. And the swing to Sir Keir Starmer's party in both places was enormous, nearly 20%.</p>\n    <p>Our panel was selected by the political research group, More in Common, and the questions were asked to the group not by me, but by its director, Luke Tryl.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7834/live/299388f0-58f2-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.png.webp\" alt=\"Jack Hill/The Times/PA Wire Rachel Reeves listens to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaking at the launch of the Government's 10-year health plan&#10;\"/>\n    <p>It's worth knowing too, when our panel was recruited, they were not told they would be asked about politics.</p>\n    <p>It could have been for any other market research exercise, for washing powder or water bills, rather than anything to do with Westminster - so it wasn't a gathering of political junkies.</p>\n    <p>But our group, who all voted Labour last time, certainly had a strong sense of what has happened to the government they elected just twelve months ago, and it wasn't pretty.</p>\n    <p>First of all, we asked the group about their impressions of Labour's first year back in office, overall.</p>\n    <p>The overwhelming sense, and one of the words used most often, was \"disappointed\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e36f/live/f9bff3d0-59b3-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp\" alt=\"From top left (L-R): Yvette, Kirsty, Ramesh, Hayley. On the bottom row (L-R): Adam, Veronica, Kelly and Sodiq\"/>\n    <p>\"I've always been Labour, but I expected much more from them,\" Yvette, who's 57 and a nutritionist said. \"I thought they'd be there for the people.\"</p>\n    <p>Kelly is 35, and a stay-at-home mum. She was frustrated about what she sees as a lack of progress on immigration. \"Everything they promised, nothing has come of it yet,\" Kelly said. \"Immigration is a big thing for me.\"</p>\n    <p>Adam, is an illustrator aged 37. He was a bit more forgiving of Sir Keir's problems: \"They are patching things up, the first year is not the year to push the big ideas, let's steady the ship.\"</p>\n    <p>But 30-year-old Sodiq, who owns his own business, reckons Labour hadn't been completely straight about what its plans were to start with.</p>\n    <p>\"I think a lot of the things that were promised were never going to happen,\" Sodiq said.</p>\n    <p>Kirsty, who's 35 and a teacher, even told us, \"I feel lied to\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9ed/live/224e92b0-58f2-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.png.webp\" alt=\"House of Commons/UK Parliament/PA Wire Screen grab of Rachel Reeves (right) crying as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London&#10;\"/>\n    <p>What about the chaos of Parliament this week, and Labour's many changes of direction since they've been in office? The group had definitely noticed what had gone on in the last seven days, not always the case when it comes to shenanigans in SW1.</p>\n    <p>Veronica, a 64-year-old carer, had seen the chancellor's tears and had some sympathy.</p>\n    <p>\"I think she's trying her best - there are going to be teething problems, it's only the first year.\" But she said, \"crying at the Commons the other day and Keir Starmer didn't even notice, but everyone else did? Sometimes I think, 'Is it the pressure getting to her?'\".</p>\n    <p>Hayley, who is a personal assistant, was also dubious that Sir Keir didn't notice, but reckons the government deserves more time.</p>\n    <p>\"You can't turn the country round in a year,\" the 40-year-old said.</p>\n    <p>But it was clear the group had reservations about Labour's repeated shifts in position - whether on welfare this week, or winter fuel before.</p>\n    <p>While praising Sir Keir for listening, Adam said: \"What happened this week - another U-turn - was worrying, it pushes the idea that there is no direction.\"</p>\n    <p>Yvette said \"if he makes a decision he should stand by it\", changes of heart were like \"lastminute.com\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c688/live/31dd9320-58f2-11f0-9074-8989d8c97d87.png.webp\" alt=\"Jacob King/PA Wire Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves (left)\"/>\n    <p>In the general election there were big shifts towards Reform UK, even though they didn't win either the Dartford or Gravesham seat.</p>\n    <p>But Kent was one of the 10 councils Farage's party took control of in the local elections this May.</p>\n    <p>Reform's progress has certainly been noticed. Kelly said: \"They are picking away at figures and picking away at other things – they seem to be doing things, and proactive.\"</p>\n    <p>Given how Reform is doing in the national polls, consistently ahead of the other political parties, it was no surprise that some of the group were thinking about giving Nigel Farage a chance next time round.</p>\n    <p>\"If there were an election tomorrow I would vote for him,\" Yvette said, suggesting he should be given a chance even though \"a lot of bad things are said about him\".</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f0d/live/393463b0-58f2-11f0-b5c5-012c5796682d.png.webp\" alt=\"Jordan Pettitt/PA Wire Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer  &#10;\"/>\n    <p>But Sodiq said: \"I'm at the other end of the scale. He's a politician, like others, who says things people want to hear, and people generally are not comfortable with the two main parties, and just want to try something else.\"</p>\n    <p>Labour is worried by their grisly position in the polls, and there's something of a sense of bewilderment too about just how shaky things have got in the last few weeks.</p>\n    <p>But at senior levels, sources believe if they keep on keeping on, eventually, many voters like those we met this weekend will return to them if hopes for improvements in the NHS and the economy come to pass.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/820b8f00-4c22-11f0-a466-d54f65b60deb.png.webp\" alt=\"Laura K newsletter banner\"/>\n    <p>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/z3qtg2p\">Off Air with Laura K </a>newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac63/live/8c7c22b0-4c22-11f0-8c47-237c2e4015f5.png.webp\" alt=\"Grey presentational line\"/>\n    <p>Watch tomorrow to hear the advice that our group would give Sir Keir Starmer in order to improve, to make that happen.</p>\n    <p>Of course this is only a taste of what's on some voter's minds in just two constituencies, but the mood was certainly disappointed with what has, and has not happened since Labour moved back into power. But there was a sense, a grudging willingness among these Labour voters to give Sir Keir and the government more time.</p>\n    <p>After twelve months, Labour is most certainly down, but not necessarily out.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Top image credit: Reuters</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>BBC InDepth</i>\n      <i> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "<p>\n    <strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>This story was originally published in April 2023.\n</p>\n<p>\n            Slumped on his club, head buried in his arm, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/golf/pga-tour-designated-events-liv-golf-spt-intl/index.html\">Rory McIlroy</a> looked on the verge of tears.  \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The then-21-year-old had just watched his ball sink into the waters of Rae’s Creek at <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/golf/the-masters-food-concessions-kit-spc-spt-intl/index.html\">Augusta National </a>and with it, his dream of winning <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/golf/scottie-scheffler-masters-champions-menu-spt-intl/index.html\">The Masters</a>, a dream that had looked so tantalizingly close mere hours earlier.\n    </p>\n<p>As a four-time major winner and one of the most decorated names in the sport’s history, few players would turn down the chance to swap places with McIlroy heading into Augusta this week.</p>\n<p>Yet on Sunday afternoon of April 10, 2011, not a golfer in the world would have wished to be in the Northern Irishman’s shoes.</p>\n<h2>Flying</h2>\n<p>A fresh-faced, mop-headed McIlroy had touched down in Georgia for the first major of the season with a reputation as the leading light of the next generation of stars.</p>\n<p>An excellent 2010 had marked his best season since turning pro three years earlier, highlighted by a first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship and a crucial contribution to Team Europe’s triumph at the Ryder Cup.</p>\n<p>Yet despite a pair of impressive top-three finishes at the Open and PGA Championship respectively, a disappointing missed cut at The Masters – his first at a major – served as ominous foreshadowing.</p>\n<p>McIlroy shot 74 and 77 to fall four strokes short of the cut line at seven-over par, a performance that concerned him enough to take a brief sabbatical from competition.</p>\n<p>But one year on in 2011, any lingering Masters demons looked to have been exorcised as McIlroy flew round the Augusta fairways.</p>\n<p>Having opened with a bogey-free seven-under 65 – the first time he had ever shot in the 60s at the major – McIlroy pulled ahead from Spanish first round co-leader Alvaro Quirós with a second round 69.</p>\n<p>\n            It sent him into the weekend holding a two-shot cushion over Australia’s Jason Day, with <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/20/golf/jon-rahm-tiger-woods-genesis-invitational-spt-intl/index.html\">Tiger Woods</a> a further stroke behind and back in the hunt for a 15th major after a surging second round 66.\n    </p>\n<p>And yet the 21-year-old leader looked perfectly at ease with having a target on his back. Even after a tentative start to the third round, McIlroy rallied with three birdies across the closing six holes to stretch his lead to four strokes heading into Sunday.</p>\n<p>The youngster was out on his own ahead of a bunched chasing pack comprising Day, Ángel Cabrera, K.J. Choi and Charl Schwartzel. After 54 holes, McIlroy had shot just three bogeys.</p>\n<p>“It’s a great position to be in … I’m finally feeling comfortable on this golf course,” McIlroy told reporters.</p>\n<p>“I’m not getting ahead of myself, I know how leads can dwindle away very quickly. I have to go out there, not take anything for granted and go out and play as hard as I’ve played the last three days. If I can do that, hopefully things will go my way.</p>\n<p>“We’ll see what happens tomorrow because four shots on this golf course isn’t that much.”</p>\n<h2>Falling</h2>\n<p>The truth can hurt, and McIlroy was about to prove his assessment of Augusta to be true in the most excruciating way imaginable.</p>\n<p>His fourth bogey of the week arrived immediately. Having admitted to expecting some nerves at the first tee, McIlroy sparked a booming opening drive down the fairway, only to miss his putt from five feet.</p>\n<p>Three consecutive pars steadied the ship, but Schwartzel had the wind in his sails. A blistering birdie, par, eagle start had seen him draw level at the summit after his third hole.</p>\n<p>A subsequent bogey from the South African slowed his charge, as McIlroy clung onto a one-shot lead at the turn from Schwartzel, Cabrera, Choi, and a rampaging Woods, who shot five birdies and an eagle across the front nine to send Augusta into a frenzy.</p>\n<p>Despite his dwindling advantage and the raucous Tiger-mania din ahead of him, McIlroy had responded well to another bogey at the 5th hole, draining a brilliant 20-foot putt at the 7th to restore his lead.</p>\n<p>The fist pump that followed marked the high-water point of McIlroy’s round, as a sliding start accelerated into full-blown free-fall at the par-four 10th hole.</p>\n<p>His tee shot went careening into a tree, ricocheting to settle between the white cabins that separate the main course from the adjacent par-three course. It offered viewers a glimpse at a part of Augusta rarely seen on broadcast, followed by pictures of McIlroy anxiously peering out from behind a tree to track his follow-up shot.</p>\n<p>Though his initial escape was successful, yet another collision with a tree and a two-putt on the green saw a stunned McIlroy eventually tap in for a triple bogey. Having led the field one hole and seven shots earlier, he arrived at the 11th tee in seventh.</p>\n<p>By the time his tee drive at the 13th plopped into the creek, all thoughts of who might be the recipient of the green jacket had long-since switched away from the anguished youngster. It had taken him seven putts to navigate the previous two greens, as a bogey and a double bogey dropped him to five-under – the score he had held after just 11 holes of the tournament.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, the last five holes passed without major incident. A missed putt for birdie from five feet at the final hole summed up McIlroy’s day, though he was given a rousing reception as he left the green.</p>\n<p>Mere minutes earlier, the same crowd had erupted as Schwartzel sunk his fourth consecutive birdie to seal his first major title. After starting the day four shots adrift of McIlroy, the South African finished 10 shots ahead of him, and two ahead of second-placed Australian duo Jason Day and Adam Scott.</p>\n<p>McIlroy’s eight-over 80 marked the highest score of the round. Having headlined the leaderboard for most of the week, he finished tied-15th.</p>\n<h2>Bounce-back</h2>\n<p>Tears would flow during a phone call with his parents the following morning, but at his press conference, McIlroy was upbeat.</p>\n<p>“I’m very disappointed at the minute, and I’m sure I will be for the next few days, but I’ll get over it,” he said.</p>\n<p>“I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled … It’s a Sunday at a major, what it can do.</p>\n<p>“This is my first experience at it, and hopefully the next time I’m in this position I’ll be able to handle it a little better. I didn’t handle it particularly well today obviously, but it was a character-building day … I’ll come out stronger for it.”</p>\n<p>Once again, McIlroy would be proven right.</p>\n<p>Just eight weeks later in June, McIlroy rampaged to an eight-shot victory at the US Open. Records tumbled in his wake at Congressional, as he shot a tournament record 16-under 268 to become the youngest major winner since Tiger Woods at The Masters in 1997.</p>\n<p>The historic victory kickstarted a golden era for McIlroy. After coasting to another eight-shot win at the PGA Championship in 2012, McIlroy became only the third golfer since 1934 to win three majors by the age of 25 with triumph at the 2014 Open Championship.</p>\n<p>Before the year was out, he would add his fourth major title with another PGA Championship win.</p>\n<p>\n            And much of it was owed to that fateful afternoon at Augusta. In an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/32151385\">interview</a> with the BBC in 2015, McIlroy dubbed it “the most important day” of his career.\n    </p>\n<p>“If I had not had the whole unravelling, if I had just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one, I would not have learned as much.</p>\n<p>“Luckily, it did not take me long to get into a position like that again when I was leading a major and I was able to get over the line quite comfortably. It was a huge learning curve for me and I needed it, and thankfully I have been able to move on to bigger and better things.</p>\n<p>“Looking back on what happened in 2011, it doesn’t seem as bad when you have four majors on your mantelpiece.”</p>\n<h2>The missing piece</h2>\n<p>McIlroy’s contentment came with a caveat: it would be “unthinkable” if he did not win The Masters in his career.</p>\n<p>Yet as he prepares for his 15th appearance at Augusta National this week, a green jacket remains an elusive missing item from his wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Despite seven top-10 finishes in his past 10 Masters outings, the trophy remains the only thing separating McIlroy from joining the ranks of golf immortals to have completed golf’s career grand slam of all four majors in the modern era: Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/golf/rory-mcilroy-masters-meltdown-2011-spt-spc-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>The fate of President Joe Biden’s federal student loan forgiveness program, which promises to deliver up to $20,000 of debt relief for millions of borrowers, lies with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n            The justices <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/28/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court-arguments-takeaways/index.html\">heard arguments on February 28</a> in two cases concerning the forgiveness program, and a decision is expected by late June or early July.\n    </p>\n<p>About 26 million people had already applied by the time a federal district court judge struck down the program on November 10, 2022 – prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.</p>\n<p>\n            The administration <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-launch/index.html\">officially launched the application</a> on October 17, 2022, following a brief “beta period” during which its team assessed whether tweaks were needed.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            If the Supreme Court ultimately allows the program to move forward, not every student loan borrower is <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/means-testing-student-loan-forgiveness-what-matters/index.html\">eligible for the debt relief</a>. First, only federally held student loans qualify. Private student loans are excluded. \n    </p>\n<p>Second, high-income borrowers are generally excluded from receiving debt forgiveness. Individual borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year and married couples or heads of households who make less than $250,000 annually could see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.</p>\n<p>\n            If a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-qualify/index.html\">qualifying borrower</a> also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/pell-grant-student-loan-forgiveness/index.html\">Pell grants</a> are awarded to millions of low-income students each year, based on factors including their family’s size and income and the cost charged by their college. These borrowers are also more likely to struggle to repay their student debt and <a href=\"https://ticas.org/files/pub_files/students_at_the_greatest_risk_of_default.pdf\">end up in default</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>Here’s what else borrowers need to know about the proposed student loan forgiveness plan:</p>\n<h2>What are the legal challenges to Biden’s forgiveness plan?</h2>\n<p>The Biden administration faced several lawsuits over the student loan forgiveness program, two of which have made it to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs argue that the Department of Education is overstepping its authority.</p>\n<p>\n            One of the lawsuits was brought by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/politics/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-ruling/index.html\">six Republican-led states</a>, headed by Nebraska, that argue that the student loan forgiveness program violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n    </p>\n<p>A lower court judge dismissed this lawsuit on October 20, ruling that the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and blocked the program.</p>\n<p>\n            The other challenge that the Supreme Court heard<i> </i>was brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some. \n    </p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed with the backing of a conservative group called the Job Creators Network Foundation. A federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the program on November 10.</p>\n<p>\n            Lawyers for the government say that Congress gave the secretary of education “expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies,” like the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1528451/download\">memo</a> from<i> </i>the Department of Justice. \n    </p>\n<h2>When will I receive my debt relief?</h2>\n<p>It’s unclear when, or if, borrowers will see debt relief under Biden’s program.</p>\n<p>Administration officials expected to be able to grant relief before January, when payments were set resume after the pandemic-related pause expired. But now debt cancellation won’t occur until at least June when the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling.</p>\n<p>\n            On November 22, 2022, the Biden administration extended the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest a final time. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, student loan interest will resume on September 1 and payments will be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/12/politics/student-loan-payments-pause-ends-october/index.html\">due starting in October</a>. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/student-loan-forgiveness-payments-debt-ceiling-deal/index.html\">law passed in early June </a>that addressees the debt ceiling prohibits another extension of the pause.\n    </p>\n<p>The White House has said that it has already approved 16 million applications for debt relief. The Department of Education will hold on to that information so it can quickly process those borrowers’ relief if the government prevails in court.</p>\n<p>If and when the program moves forward, an estimated 8 million borrowers may receive debt relief automatically because the Department of Education already has their income on file.</p>\n<p>\n            If the government restarts taking applications, borrowers can apply online here: <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application\">https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief/application.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>Applicants can expect to receive an email confirmation once their application is successfully submitted. Then, borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer when the debt cancellation has been applied to their account.</p>\n<p>Borrowers were expected to have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.</p>\n<h2>What kind of federal loans are eligible?</h2>\n<p>There are a variety of federal student loans and not all are eligible for relief if the program is allowed to proceed. Federal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.</p>\n<p>But federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders are not eligible unless the borrower applied to consolidate those loans into a Direct Loan by September 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>\n            The Department of Education initially said these privately held loans, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-lawsuit/index.html\">but reversed course last September</a> when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers. \n    </p>\n<p>Defaulted Federal Family Education Loans and defaulted Perkins Loans would be eligible for the debt relief even if they are privately held.</p>\n<h2>What year is the income threshold based on?</h2>\n<p>\n            If Biden’s program is allowed to move forward, eligibility is based on a borrower’s <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/definition-of-adjusted-gross-income\">adjusted gross income</a> for either tax year 2020 or 2021. Adjusted gross income can be lower than your total wages because it considers tax deductions and adjustments, like contributions made to a 401(k) retirement plan.\n    </p>\n<p>A taxpayer’s adjusted gross income can be found on line 11 of IRS Form 1040.</p>\n<h2>How will the government know what my income was?</h2>\n<p>The Department of Education says it already has income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. If the program is allowed to move forward, those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.</p>\n<p>Millions of other borrowers will need to apply for student loan forgiveness if the Department of Education doesn’t have their income information on file. When they submit the application, borrowers are required to self-attest that their income is under the eligibility threshold. They are required to certify that the information provided is accurate upon penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p>The Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. Officials expect that just 5% of borrowers with eligible federal student loans would not qualify due to the income threshold.</p>\n<h2>Will I have to pay taxes on the amount of debt canceled?</h2>\n<p>Borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiven, thanks to a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in 2021.</p>\n<p>But it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven. Most states will not tax the forgiveness as income.</p>\n<h2>I’m a current student. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, some current students would be eligible under Biden’s plan if it’s allowed to take effect. Eligibility for borrowers who filed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA, as an independent will be based on the individual’s own household income.</p>\n<p>\n            Eligibility for borrowers who are enrolled as <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency\">dependent students</a>, generally those under the age of 24, will be based on parental income for either 2020 or 2021.\n    </p>\n<h2>I have student debt from graduate school. Am I eligible for forgiveness?</h2>\n<p>Yes, if your income meets the eligibility threshold and the program is allowed to be implemented.</p>\n<h2>I’m a parent and took out a Parent PLUS loan. Am I eligible?</h2>\n<p>\n            Yes, you could be eligible if your income meets the threshold. A parent borrower with federal <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent\">Parent PLUS</a> loans for multiple children is still only eligible for up to $20,000 of loan forgiveness.\n    </p>\n<p>But a parent is only eligible for up to $20,000 in debt relief if he or she received a Pell grant for his or her own education. If only the child received a Pell grant, the parent is eligible for up to $10,000 in forgiveness.</p>\n<h2>How do I know if I ever received a Pell grant?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-faq/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.</p>\n    <p>In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.</p>\n    <p>Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.</p>\n    <p>Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.</p>\n    <p>\n            Images of the two captured snailfish – identified as <i>Pseudoliparis belyaevi</i> – provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.<strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.</p>\n    <p>The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.</p>\n    <p>Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.</p>\n    <p>“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/asia/deepest-fish-filmed-off-japan-scn-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/world/climate-warming-emissions-study-intl/index.html\">escalating climate crisis</a> is shifting many people’s purchasing patterns and this extends to the $500 billion dollar global beauty industry which is grappling with a range of sustainability challenges across product manufacturing, packaging and disposal. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Strategy and consulting firm <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/sites/default/files/studies/Simon-Kucher_Global_Sustainability_Study_2021.pdf\">Simon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021</a> found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            This shift in consumer preferences has propelled <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/business/business-climate-earth-day-roundup/index.html\">many beauty brands to set environmental goals</a>: to move away from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/us/plastic-recycling-climate-impact-lbg/index.html\">single-use and virgin plastics</a>, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.\n    </p>\n<p>However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.</p>\n<h2>Ingredient and branding transparency</h2>\n<p>\n            There is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2023/03/13/jessica-alba-honest-company-criticism-wtcw-vpx.cnn\">“greenwashing,”</a> where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            Companies often use marketing language like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/clean-beauty-vs-green-beauty\">“clean beauty”</a> to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.\n    </p>\n<p>“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”</p>\n<p>\n            In a <a href=\"https://britishbeautycouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/the-courage-to-change.pdf\">2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change”</a> their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”\n    </p>\n<p>“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.</p>\n<p>\n            Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals — <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/15/health/makeup-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html\">including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde</a> — it claims to never use in its products.)\n    </p>\n<p>“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”</p>\n<p>“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”</p>\n<p>Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”</p>\n<h2>Unpacking plastics</h2>\n<p>\n            The industry’s plastic packaging is <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/05/energy/single-use-plastics-volume-grows-climate-intl-hnk/index.html\">a particular sustainability challenge</a> — 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used <a href=\"https://gc-22.emf.org/ppu/\">144,430 metric tons of plastic</a> in its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United States <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/environment/plastic-pollution-is-growing-relentlessly-as-waste-management-and-recycling-fall-short.htm\">only recycles 4% of its plastic waste</a>.\n    </p>\n<p>Many brands are trying to phase out harmful plastics from their operations and adopt post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic. (L’Oreal has set a target of 50% PCR plastic usage by 2025, while Estee Lauder is targeting 25% “or more” PCR plastic — but both are far from achieving their targets.)</p>\n<p>“Between 60-70 major global brands have made unprecedented progress” in PCR plastic usage across industries, EMF’s Plastic Initiative Lead Sander DeFruyt told CNN. But DeFruyt stressed that PCR plastic must be adopted in conjunction with brands removing single and virgin plastics from their usage cycles to truly make a difference.</p>\n<p>However, PCR plastic is not easy to find — low recycling rates around the world mean there is limited supply. Meanwhile, demand for it is growing demand across industries, DeFruyt said. This competition hikes up its price, which is already higher than virgin plastic.</p>\n<p>Hair care brand FEKKAI claims that it used up to 95% PCR content in its packaging, but pricing and supply issues posed a challenge, forcing it to currently aim for containers and packaging that feature at least 50% PCR in its packaging.</p>\n<p>“PCR plastic is more expensive than stock plastic. The cost is hard and then sourcing it is too,” founder Frédéric Fekkai told CNN. “PCR is close to our heart, but there is a massive demand, so finding recycled plastic is difficult.”</p>\n<h2>The weight of retail</h2>\n<p>Beauty retailers plays a pivotal — and under-utilized — role, with control over stocking decisions and supply chains. But many vary when it comes to the standards they set for brands they sell.</p>\n<p>\n            “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/beauty-brand-recycling-programs\">Smaller businesses do more</a>, full stop,” said Jessi Baker, founder of the technology platform Provenance, which helps brands display their sustainability credentials for customers. “They move more nimbly. Some of them are born-good brands — climate friendliness was part of their setup. They don’t need to restructure their entire supply chain. Their culture already has it compared to the larger brands who need to work hard to change.”\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Sephora launched its “<a href=\"https://www.sephora.com/beauty/eco-friendly-beauty\">Clean + Planet Positive</a>” initiative in 2021, which labeled products that met its set criteria. (This is separate from the French retailer’s “Clean at Sephora” program, which is currently facing a consumer lawsuit alleging it carries a significant percentage of products understood by customers to be harmful.) Target launched a similar program in 2022, featuring a “Target Zero” icon for both online and in-store offerings that either have reusable, recyclable, compostable or reduced plastic packaging, or feature waterless or concentrated products.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Still, many steps taken by brands and retailers do not even begin to touch on the waste and pollution generated <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/economy/climate-change-inflation-food-energy-prices/index.html\">throughout supply chains, manufacturing and shipping</a>, all huge problems for the industry to grapple with. \n    </p>\n<h2>The missing player</h2>\n<p>\n            The gaps in standardization in the beauty ecosystem can, to some extent, be filled by certifications such as the US-born <a href=\"https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/\">B Corporation, or B Corp</a>. This accreditation, one of the most well-known in the beauty space, is issued by the non-profit B Lab, which scores a company on a variety of criteria around ethics and sustainability. However beneficial it may be among <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/home/how-to-shop-big-box-retailers-vs-brands-sustainably\">eco-conscious consumers</a>, though, it is currently completely voluntary for brands to apply for.\n    </p>\n<p>Governments and multinationals enforcing regulations and setting a base line for brands to operate from when making sustainability claims would go a long way to making change, many experts and business leaders believe.</p>\n<p>Susanne Kaufmann, founder of her namesake beauty brand, says her efforts in Austria would reap better results if more countries around the world had stricter, more uniform garbage disposal laws.</p>\n<p>“I package our product in a recyclable material,” Kaufmann said. (Her products’ packaging, which is refillable and reusable, is made from 75% recycled plastic — and is 100% recyclable.) If I send this to the US, the garbage is not separated… and it’s not recyclable,” she explained, referring to inconsistencies in recycling laws across the United States.</p>\n<p>\n            And when it comes to ingredients, the European Chemicals Agency <a href=\"https://echa.europa.eu/cosmetics-prohibited-substances?p_p_id=eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByCol=fld_erc2_appname&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_substance_identifier_field_key=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_delta=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_orderByType=asc&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_doSearch=&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_deltaParamValue=200&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_resetCur=false&amp;_eucleflegislationlist_WAR_euclefportlet_cur=3\"> lists 2,495 substances</a> banned from use in cosmetic products marketed for sale or use in the bloc. But the US Food and Drug administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/prohibited-restricted-ingredients-cosmetics\">only lists 11</a>, making it more challenging for American consumers to find safer, greener options. The Environmental Working Group, a non-profit watchdog, studied <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/does-europe-have-better-sunscreens/#.Wl-GvpM-d-U\">lab tests of 51 sunscreen products</a> in 2021 and found that only 35% of products met the EU standard, compared with 94% that passed the US standard. \n    </p>\n<p>However, while government can set minimum requirements, Mia Davis, vice president of sustainability and impact at beauty retailer Credo Beauty, says the needle will move in the private sector.</p>\n<p>“Regulation can raise the floor a bit. A person who doesn’t know about any (sustainability issues) should still be able to walk into a bodega and get clean products… But that’s never going to be what the market can do,” she said. “Market leadership is key.”</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/beauty-skincare-climate/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Nowadays, it is more loosely used to refer to some of Africa’s largest and most iconic animals.</p>\n    <p>However, British photographer Graeme Green has reclaimed the narrative, creating a global “New Big Five” for wildlife photography. In 2021, 50,000 people around the world voted for the five animals they would most like to photograph, or see photographed, in the wild. Five animals were crowned the winners: the elephant, polar bear, lion, gorilla and tiger.</p>\n    <p>\n            This week, sees the publication of “<a href=\"https://www.newbig5.com/\">The New Big 5</a>” photography book, which features images of those animals and other at-risk wildlife, from photography legends such as Ami Vitale, Steve McCurry and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/world/climate-change-photography-paul-nicklen-cristina-mittermeier-c2e-spc-intl-scn-climate/index.html\">Paul Nicklen</a>, and essays from famous conservationists and activists including like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/africa/jane-goodall-conservation/index.html\">Jane Goodall</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/opinions/paula-kahumbu-africa-wildlife-filmmakers-c2e-spc-intl/index.html\">Paula Kahumbu</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Green says that the book celebrates wildlife and is a global call to action on issues impacting wildlife, including habitat loss, poaching, pollution and climate change.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230330162944-the-new-big-5-graeme-green.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"British photographer Graeme Green is the founder of the New Big 5 project, an international conservation initiative supported by photographers, conservationists and wildlife charities.\"/>\n    <h2>Animals at risk</h2>\n    <p>Green was on assignment in Botswana at least a decade ago when he came up with the idea for a project to encourage people to “shoot with a camera, not a gun,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“I thought this would be a way to get people really focusing on wildlife, thinking about the wildlife they love, thinking about the animals that are at risk.”</p>\n    <p>In total, the book includes the work of 144 globally renowned wildlife photographers from Ecuador to India. Curating the images took nearly two years of work, says Green.</p>\n    <p>“I think these are some of the most beautiful and creative images that I’ve seen put together in one book,” says Green. “These are the species that we are at risk of losing.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404101434-new-big-5-cover.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;The New Big 5: A Global Photography Project For Endangered Wildlife&quot; by Graeme Green is out now.\"/>\n    <p>\n            According to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/\">UN</a>, nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, with around one million of the planet’s animal and plant species facing extinction. The “New Big 5,” all of which are threatened, act as ambassadors for what is happening in the natural world, says Green. \n    </p>\n    <p>As well as being a powerful reminder of what we stand to lose, the book also points people towards potential solutions. Featured essays explore the benefits of rewilding and the importance of indigenous communities in conservation.</p>\n    <p>A chapter on endangered species from bees to blue whales illustrates the alarming threat climate change poses to animals outside of the “New Big 5.” “That’s only the tip of the iceberg – I could have included thousands of pictures because that’s how serious the situation is,” says Green.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403092410-the-new-big-5-tiger-thomas-vijayan-story-card.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;In Indian forests, it's very difficult to get a proper picture of a running tiger, as they all are thick forests. I kept the camera settings fast enough to freeze the running tiger,&quot; said photographer Thomas Vijayan in a press release.\"/>\n    <p>Jane Goodall, a leading conservationist who also wrote the afterword to the book, said in a press release that “we have a window of time during which we can start to heal some of the harm we have inflicted on the natural world, but only if we get together and take action now.</p>\n    <p>“I hope the photos will lead people into the wonderful worlds of these iconic species. Then, perhaps, other people will become involved in helping to create a world where wildlife can flourish for future generations to enjoy,” she said.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>“The New Big 5: A Global Photography Project For Endangered Wildlife,” by Graeme Green, published by Earth Aware Editions, is on sale from April 4, 2023.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n  <i>This story has been updated to reflect the range of issues covered by the book.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/new-big-5-wildlife-photography-book-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.</p>\n    <p>Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.</p>\n    <p>“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”</p>\n    <p>Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.</p>\n    <p>The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.</p>\n    <p>Ostelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.</p>\n    <p>Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.</p>\n    <p>The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.</p>\n    <p>The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.</p>\n    <h2>‘Investing in your future’</h2>\n    <p>Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.</p>\n    <p>\n            At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from home <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/world/syria-refugee-crisis-when-war-displaces-half-a-country/index.html\">by late 2015</a> – about half of Syria’s pre-war population. \n    </p>\n    <p>Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.</p>\n    <p>While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.</p>\n    <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.</p>\n    <p>\n            The move sparked a backlash in Germany and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/06/europe/angela-merkel-migration-germany-intl/index.html\">the sudden growth</a> of the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the wake of summer 2015.\n    </p>\n    <p>Once in Germany, Alshebl lived close to Ostelsheim and said at the time he felt “there is only one thing you can do: get back on your feet quickly and start investing in your own future quickly.”</p>\n    <p>For the last seven years he worked in the administration of Althengstett town hall, in a neighboring town. He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities.

He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/t-magazine/kwame-brathwaite-photographer.html\">T Magazine</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/5973va/kwame-braithwaites-breathtaking-photos-shaped-the-black-is-beautiful-movement\">Vice</a>, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404135409-03-kwame-brathwaite-obituary-models.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Brathwaite's photograph of models who embraced their natural hair, photographed in 1966.\"/>\n    <p>Using a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.</p>\n    <p>\n            “You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite told <a href=\"https://aperture.org/from-the-archive/kwame-brathwaite-black-is-beautiful/\">Aperture Magazine</a> in 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”\n    </p>\n    <p>By the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230404135404-02-kwame-brathwaite-obituary-car.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Women in a car gathered for Garvey Day, the annual event commemorating Black activist Marcus Garvey.\"/>\n    <p>By the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.</p>\n    <p>\n            Throughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère for <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/an-artists-ornate-natural-hair-styles-through-the-eyes-of-a-legendary-photographer-of-black-beauty\">The New Yorker</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “<a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9988/kwame-brathwaite-things-well-worth-waiting-for\">Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For</a>,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Top image: Kwame Brathwaite, “Untitled (Sikolo Brathwaite, Orange Portrait),” 1968</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/kwame-brathwaite-obituary-tan/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday. \n    </p>\n    <p>The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.</p>\n    <p>“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”</p>\n    <p>The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.</p>\n    <p>“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.</p>\n    <p>\n            The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html\">record $5.02 a gallon on June 14</a>, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/energy/gas-prices-rise/index.html\">average price fell every day</a>. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/strategic-petroleum-reserve-joe-biden/index.html\">US Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a>, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline. \n    </p>\n    <p>Even at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n    <p>Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.</p>\n    <p>“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/energy/gas-prices-opec/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194318-02-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.\"/>\n    <h2>Rising pressure</h2>\n    <p>\n            The expected meeting, which McCarthy’s office <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/kevin-mccarthy-taiwan-president-meeting-china/index.html\">announced</a> earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication<strong> </strong>amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\">suspected Chinese surveillance balloon</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/tech/us-sanctions-chips-china-xi-tech-ambitions-intl-hnk/index.html\">semiconductor supply chains</a> – raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n    </p>\n    <p>Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.</p>\n    <p>But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.</p>\n    <p>For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.</p>\n    <p>That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.</p>\n    <p>China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.</p>\n    <p>The party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”</p>\n    <p>It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.</p>\n    <p>While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.</p>\n    <p>Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.</p>\n    <p>Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.</p>\n    <p>Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194350-03-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency.\"/>\n    <h2>Beijing watching</h2>\n    <p>A meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.</p>\n    <p>\n            Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/china/china-public-opinion-military-response-pelosi-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric</a> in mainland China. \n    </p>\n    <p>This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.</p>\n    <p>But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.</p>\n    <p>As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.</p>\n    <p>\n            It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/asia/taiwan-former-president-ma-visit-china-intl-hnk/index.html\">Ma Ying-jeou</a>, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n    </p>\n    <p>Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.</p>\n    <p>\n            China is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/23/china/taiwan-ukraine-parallels-china-russia-intl-hnk-mic/index.html\">global spotlight</a> following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Beijing has recently sought to position itself as <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/23/china/china-position-political-settlement-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html\">an agent of peace</a> in that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n    </p>\n    <p>This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.</p>\n    <p>\n            An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/biden-xi-meeting-g20-summit-bali-indonesia/h_93dc31c74b4bfe3b5ab35a8c0bb23901\">face-to-face meeting</a> in Bali. \n    </p>\n    <p>“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.</p>\n    <p>“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220819143103-china-amb-nicholas-burns-vpx.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"China Amb Nicholas Burns vpx\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Wayne Chang contributed reporting.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, he’s completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment. \n    </p>\n    <p>Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission.</p>\n    <p>Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts.</p>\n    <p>He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/victor-j-glover/biography\">Glover</a> is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/02/tech/nasa-spacex-astronauts-return-iss-highlights-scn/index.html\">piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft</a> and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station.\n    </p>\n    <p>“It’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We need to celebrate this moment in human history. … It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions.</p>\n    <p>Glover’s first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory.</p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/christina-hammock-koch/biography/\">Koch</a>, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks — including the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/18/world/nasa-all-female-spacewalk-koch-meir-scn-trnd/index.html\">first all-female spacewalk in 2019</a>. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission.\n    </p>\n    <h2>About this mission</h2>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/world/nasa-splashdown-artemis-i-orion-sunday-scn/index.html\">uncrewed test mission</a> that sent NASA’s Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120057-artemis-ii-crew-official-portrait.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The Artemis II lunar flyby mission crew members include (from left): NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman (foreground) and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen.\"/>\n    <p>If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>\n    <p>The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined.</p>\n    <p>The “exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission,” NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email.</p>\n    <p>After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n    <p>Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p>\n    <p>\n            The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/03/15/world/nasa-spacesuits-moon-artemis-unveil-scn/index.html\">spacesuits</a> for walking on the moon and a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/business/spacex-static-fire-starship-super-heavy-scn/index.html\">lunar lander</a> to ferry the astronauts to the moon’s surface, is still in development.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            NASA is targeting a <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/artemis-iii/\">2025 launch date</a> for Artemis III, though the space agency’s inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-22-003.pdf\">2026 or later</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars.</p>\n    <h2>Picking the astronauts</h2>\n    <p>\n            Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/world/nasa-artemis-moon-secretive-crew-selection-process/index.html\">selection process</a>. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff,” Wyche said. “We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/17/world/astronaut-right-stuff-apollo-11-trnd-scn/index.html\">inaugural missions</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>Koch said in an interview with CNN’s Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago.</p>\n    <p>“We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didn’t sound as lofty as the one it was going to be,” Koch said. “And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting.”</p>\n    <p>She said the offer rendered her “speechless.”</p>\n    <p>“It truly is an honor,” she added. “It’s an honor — not to get myself in the space — but because it’s amazing to be a part of this team that’s going back to the moon and on to Mars.”</p>\n    <p>An interview with the four astronauts will air on “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET.</p>\n    <p>\n  <i>CNN’s Kristin Fisher contributed to this story.</i>\n</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/world/artemis-2-astronaut-crew-scn/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.</p>\n    <p>\n            Inflation in the United Kingdom also <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/22/economy/inflation-uk-surprise-rise-february/index.html\">jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February</a>, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.\n    </p>\n    <h2>The pound turnaround</h2>\n    <p>The pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.</p>\n    <p>The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.</p>\n    <p>“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.</p>\n    <p>But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.</p>\n    <p>“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.</p>\n    <p>The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.</p>\n    <p>Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.</p>\n    <p>A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.</p>\n    <p>Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.</p>\n    <p>“In a volatile market environment, moves are exacerbated,” he said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/investing/british-pound-currency-dollar/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Keep shining my love and always remember to #liveitup,” Heming Willis added.</p>\n    <p>Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009.

Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.</p>\n    <p>“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”</p>\n    <p>After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.</p>\n    <p>“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU.

It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/lithium-us-groundwater\">according to the US Geological Survey.</a> \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2803171?guestAccessKey=9a8969db-b1bb-4260-a0c8-77cc4bfca160&amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=040323\">new study,</a> published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.</p>\n    <p>\n            As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD<strong> </strong>diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.</p>\n    <p>Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.</p>\n    <p>Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.</p>\n    <p>“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.</p>\n    <p>\n            The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710473/\">health benefits</a> such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.\n    </p>\n    <p>“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”</p>\n    <p>Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies – which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water – do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder.</p>\n    <p>“It’s an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,” said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. “We have to see if there’s a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP9509#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20that%20air,been%20mostly%20limited%20by%20trimesters.\">air pollution</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7011a1.htm\">phthalates</a>. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder.\n    </p>\n    <h3>Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://form.cnn.com/results_are_in?source=article\">Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    </p>\n    <p>A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it’s just the populations who live in more polluted areas.</p>\n    <p>“There’s a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?” Wiznitzer said. “We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that’s high on our list.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/autism-lithium-study/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.</p>\n    <p>“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”</p>\n    <p>A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Instagrammable</i> is not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.\n    </p>\n    <p>Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).</p>\n    <p>Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.</p>\n    <p>“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.</p>\n    <h2>Spice and texture</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329092523-02-inside-haggis-with-turnips.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Haggis is traditionally served with turnips.\"/>\n    <p>For children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.</p>\n    <p>Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.</p>\n    <p>“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”</p>\n    <p>“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”</p>\n    <p>Lawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.</p>\n    <p>Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.</p>\n    <p>Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.</p>\n    <h2>Wild wee beastie</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329092534-03-inside-haggis-chip-shop.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Deep-fried haggis is often a staple of Scottish fish and chip shops. \"/>\n    <p>In neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.</p>\n    <p>Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.</p>\n    <p>But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.</p>\n    <p>It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329100500-05-inside-haggis.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Imports of Scottish haggis are banned from the United States. \"/>\n    <p>From such romantic notions it was a short step to turning the haggis into a wee wild beastie, one with longer legs on one side that was thus condemned to run round and round whichever hill it lived on. In 2003, a poll of American tourists in Scotland found that one in three of them believed they might encounter such a confused creature on a Caledonian vacation.</p>\n    <p>Bourdain, a native New Yorker, may have qualified as haggis’ biggest admirer since Burns, but his compatriots at the US Department of Agriculture remain unconverted to offal-filled paunch. Haggis imports into the United States were prohibited in 1971 as part of a ban on the consumption of all livestock lungs. Authentic versions of old school haggis remain culinary contraband in the US, as hard to lay your hands on as Cuban cigars.</p>\n    <p>Across the rest of the world, it’s a different story. According to leading producer Simon Howie, haggis is more widely appreciated and consumed now than it has been since Burns improvised his “Address to a Haggis” for the entertainment of well-to-do Edinburgh acquaintances.</p>\n    <h2>Pudding chieftan</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329173530-inside-haggis-burns-night-recrop-1.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The haggis is toasted on Burns Night, held every year in honor of Scottish poet Robert Burns.\"/>\n    <p>Firmly tongue-in-cheek, the poem lauds the “Great chieftain o’ the pudding race,” as exactly the kind of unpretentious, hearty fare required to nourish a nation of braveheart warriors.</p>\n    <p>In comparison to the enfeebling foreign muck enjoyed by the capital’s claret-quaffing elites of the time – the olio, fricassée or ragoût that would “sicken a sow” – Burns urges his readers to wonder at the magical impact of haggis on his fellow sons of Scotland’s soil.</p>\n    <p>As the English translation of the original Scots language version puts it:</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>The trembling earth resounds his tread/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Clap in his ample fist a blade/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>He’ll make it whistle/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>And legs and arms and heads will cut/</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>Off like the heads of thistles</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>These days synthetic casings have largely replaced stomach but ovine and porcine innards remain at the core of most of the haggis produced in its homeland, said Howie, who estimates that his company Simon Howie Butchers, accounts for around 60% of the roughly two million haggises produced every year.</p>\n    <p>For Howie, versatility, value for money and convenience explain why this staple of the Scottish larder is thriving. Typically haggis retails in Scotland, which accounts for half of global consumption by volume, for around £6, or $7.70 per kilogram ($3.36/pound). That’s around half the price of less expensive cuts of beef or a third of the price of Scotch lamb while enjoying a fairly similar nutritional and calorific profile.</p>\n    <p>“You can give your kids a meal that is not full of things you don’t want to feed them – for a few pounds you can feed three strapping lads,” Howie said.</p>\n    <p>“From a kitchen perspective, it is very simple because when it leaves our factory it is already cooked. So when you or a restaurant owner gets it into the kitchen all you have to do is heat it up to be piping hot. It couldn’t be more basic: a student with no cooking skills or a Michelin-starred chef do exactly the same thing to put it out on the plate.”</p>\n    <h2>Haggis pakora</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230329100506-06-inside-haggis-fine-dining.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Haggis can often be found on fine dining menus.\"/>\n    <p>Its texture means haggis can also be usefully deployed in fine dining alongside leaner meat like venison or as a stuffing for poultry and game birds. Its spicy intensity means it is also finding uses in canapés and as a crouton-borne garnish for soups.</p>\n    <p>Buoyant sales are also underpinned by the increasing consumption of haggis in forms inspired by Scotland’s ethnic minorities.</p>\n    <p>Glasgow’s Sikh community pioneered haggis pakora in the 1990s and samosas, spring rolls and quesadillas have followed in its wake, often using a vegetarian version of the protein in which the offal is replaced by a mix of vegetables, pulses and mushrooms.</p>\n    <p>Such dishes are more than culinary twists. They are badges of belonging, and an indication that, two centuries after Burns grabbed it for the nation, haggis is as intimately entwined with Scots identity as ever.</p>\n    <p>Just ask Ross O’Cinneide, a promising 14-year-old fly-half in the junior section of Stirling County rugby club.</p>\n    <p>“Most of my friends and I like haggis,” he says. “Mum makes it for us sometimes after rugby and it’s got a very nice warming feeling. And it’s nice because it’s purely Scottish.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/haggis-scotland-secrets/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n            Some VIP Twitter users woke up on Saturday expecting to have lost their coveted blue verification check marks in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">previously announced purge</a> by Elon Musk. Instead, Twitter appeared to target a single account from a major<strong> </strong>publication Musk dislikes and changed the language on its site in a way that obscures why users are verified.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Twitter had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">said</a> it would “begin winding down” blue checks granted under its old verification system — which emphasized protecting high-profile users at risk of impersonation — on April 1. In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/tech/twitter-verified-checkmarks/index.html\">join the platform’s Twitter Blue</a> subscription service, which has allowed<strong> </strong>accounts to pay for verification since December.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared,<strong> </strong>but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/media/news-organizations-elon-musk-twitter-checkmark/index.html\">previously told CNN</a> it would not pay for verification.  \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After an account that often engages with Musk posted a meme this weekend about the Times declining to pay for verification, Musk responded in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642383150230773760?s=20\">tweet</a> saying, “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Musk then lashed out at the Times — just the latest instance of the billionaire <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/17/business/elon-musk-twitter-ban-reverse-conditions/index.html#:~:text=Musk%20had%20on%20Thursday%20banned,The%20Washington%20Post\"s%20Drew%20Harwell.\">slamming journalists</a> or media outlets — in a series of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1642395451209940993?s=20\">tweets</a> that claimed the outlet’s coverage is boring and “propaganda.”  \n    </p>\n    <p>The weekend moves are just the latest example of Twitter creating confusion and whiplash for users over feature changes — and in this case, not just any users, but many of the most high-profile accounts that have long been a key selling point for the platform. It also highlights how Musk often appears to guide decisions about the platform more by whims than by policy.</p>\n    <p>Although the New York Times’ main account lost its blue check, its other accounts, such as those for its arts, travel and books content, remained verified. (It’s not clear why the New York Times doesn’t have a gold “organizations” check mark, like accounts for other news outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.) After its blue check was removed, a spokesperson for the New York Times reiterated to CNN that it does not plan to pay for verification.</p>\n    <p>Twitter, which laid off most of its public relations staff last fall, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n    <p>In a separate puzzling move, Twitter’s blue bird logo at the top of the site was replaced on Monday with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The price of dogecoin shot up 20% on Monday.</p>\n    <h2>Musk’s long campaign against “legacy” blue checks</h2>\n    <p>Musk has been threatening to take away “legacy” blue check marks from users verified under Twitter’s old system since shortly after he bought Twitter last fall.</p>\n    <p>\n            In early November, Twitter launched the option for people paying for its Twitter Blue subscription service to receive blue checks. The program was quickly put on pause after being plagued by a wave of celebrity and corporate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/tech/twitter-impersonators-paid-verification/index.html\">impersonators</a>, and was relaunched in December. \n    </p>\n    <p>Twitter also rolled out a color-coded verification system with differently colored marks for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to say that individual users would eventually have to pay for blue checks.</p>\n    <p>\n            In the days leading up to the blue check purge that wasn’t,<strong> </strong>prominent users such as actor William Shatner and anti-bullying activist Monica Lewinksy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/business/william-shatner-elon-musk-twitter-verification/index.html\">pushed back</a> against the idea that, as power users that draw attention to the site, they should have to pay for a feature that keeps them safe from impersonation. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            By muddying the reason accounts are verified, the new label could risk making it easier for people to scam or impersonate high-profile users. Experts in inauthentic behavior have also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/elon-musk-twitter-verification-plans/index.html\">said it’s not clear</a> that reserving verification for paid users will reduce the number of bots on the site, an issue Musk has raised on and off over the past year.  \n    </p>\n    <p>Musk, for his part, has previously presented changes to Twitter’s verification system as a way of “treating everyone equally.”</p>\n    <p>“There shouldn’t be a different standard for celebrities,” he said in a tweet last week. The paid feature could also drive revenue, which could help Musk, who is on the hook for significant debt after buying Twitter for $44 billion.</p>\n    <p>\n            Musk last week also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/tech/elon-musk-verified-only-for-you-feed/index.html\">said</a> that starting on April 15, only verified accounts would be recommended in users’ “For You” feeds alongside the accounts they follow. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <i>–CNN’s Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.</i> \n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/tech/twitter-blue-checks/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The group is performing well as a whole.”</p>\n    <p>Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss” because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403120210-01-hsbc-shareholders-040323-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, left, and Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, departing following the bank's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.\"/>\n    <p>\n            Investors have also been unhappy with HSBC <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/investing/dividends-coronavirus-recession/index.html\">scrapping its dividend</a> in 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.</p>\n    <p>“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.</p>\n    <p>“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”</p>\n    <p>\n            Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lender <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/investing/hsbc-stock-earnings-2021-intl-hnk/index.html\">bringing back its dividend</a> in 2021, albeit at a lower level.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403082458-hsbc-hong-kong-file-2022-restricted.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"An HSBC bank branch in Hong Kong last July.

Ping An did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how it planned to vote at the upcoming general meeting.</p>\n    <h2>Banking sector turmoil</h2>\n    <p>\n            HSBC’s leaders were also asked Monfday why the bank had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/investing/svb-uk-business-deal-intl-hnk/index.html\">scooped up</a> the British unit of SVB following the stunning collapse of its parent in the United States. The purchase was made for £1 ($1.20) last month, just days after SVB had folded.\n    </p>\n    <p>Critics have questioned HSBC’s ability to perform adequate due diligence on SVB UK’s customers because of how quickly the deal came together.</p>\n    <p>“Did HSBC look into the clients of SVB in detail? Say, the financial statement — whether they can pay back the loan?” said Fong.</p>\n    <p>Quinn and Tucker defended the acquisition, calling it a good business opportunity that allowed the bank to gain hundreds of innovative startups as customers.

In 2019, they <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/business/ceo-letter-abortion-ad-new-york-times/index.html\">called</a> abortion bans “bad for business.” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/01/business/corporate-pac-suspensions/\">pledged</a> to halt their political giving.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarily <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/companies-pulling-back-russia-ukraine-war-intl-hnk/index.html\">curtail</a> their operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Dick’s Sporting Goods <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/10/business/dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-edward-stack-profile/index.html\">stopped selling</a> semi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup put <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/22/news/companies/citigroup-gun-restrictions/index.html\">new restrictions</a> on gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/business/walmart-gun-policy-reactions/index.html\">Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this past <a href=\"https://www.ceosforgunsafety.org/pages/2022-letter\">summer</a> nearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/business/sonnenfeld-yale-corporate-responsibility-uvalde/index.html\">address it</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            That’s why corporate America’s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/business/guns-corporate-america-nashville/index.html\">silence</a> in the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/03/11/sonnenfeld-russia-ukraine-corporations/\">vocal advocate of corporate social responsibility</a> who has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said. \n    </p>\n    <p>Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>This interview has been edited for clarity and length. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld: </strong>Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the interfaith activity of clergy locking arms and canvassing legislators. We saw campuses alive and aroused. Where’s all the student activism? \n    </p>\n    <p>The CEOs are still the most active even if they’re less active than they were six months ago. They’re not there as hired hands of shareholders to fill the role of politicians and civic leaders. They’re there to join that chorus, but they don’t want to be the only one singing.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So is this what you’re hearing from top CEOs? Have they gotten tired of advocating? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>I just got off of a CEO call on voting rights and this morning we had a forum on sustainability – CEOs are still the most active on these fronts. It’s the same thing on immigration reform. If a CEO was working an 18 hour day on a 12 day week, they still couldn’t address all of the issues that need addressing.</p>\n    <p>The nation’s CEOs are waiting for everybody else to join them. They don’t need to restate something they’ve already stated. They’ve jumped in the pool, where’s everybody else?</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>So what do you think has led to this complacency amongst Americans and the growing reliance on CEOs to advocate on our behalf? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>They’ve taken a very strong stance and they’ve gone out further than the general public. They are where the general public is on surveys, but they’re not where the general public is on action in the streets. So we’re ready for others to now do something. Enough already on saying ‘what are the CEOs doing?’ Social capital is as valuable as financial capital. CEOs understand that in their soul, they want there to be social capital. They want there to be public trust, but they need the rest of civil society to join them. And that’s their frustration.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>It sounds like CEOs are frustrated?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Yeah, they’re frustrated.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>But don’t these CEOs hold the purse strings in terms of donating to powerful politicians? </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>You would think that, but since the 2020 elections much less of campaign contributions have come from big business. Since the 2021 run on the Capitol, a lot of businesses either had an official moratorium or they’ve given mere pennies to politicians. The common impression on the street that CEOs are controlling campaign purses strings is 100% wrong.</p>\n    <h2>Tesla sales again fall short of production</h2>\n    <p>\n            <i>By CNN’s Chris Isidore </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Tesla <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/investing/tesla-sales?utm_source=business_ribbon\">reported. </a> a modest 4% rise in sales in the first quarter compared to the final three months of last year, despite a series of price cuts on its lower priced vehicles and talk by CEO Elon Musk about strong demand at those lower prices.\n    </p>\n    <p>The first quarter also marked the fourth straight quarter that Tesla has produced more vehicles than it has delivered to customers. Some of that may be due to the ramp up in production at two new factories, one in Texas, the other in Germany, which opened last spring, and a lag between that increased production and sales.</p>\n    <p>Tesla said there was an increase in the number of its more expensive models, the Model S and Model X, in transit to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as to the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n    <p>But it does mean that over the last 12 months Tesla has produced 78,000 more cars than it has sold, suggesting that talk of strong demand by Tesla executives may not be backed up by the numbers.</p>\n    <p>“Early this year, we had a price adjustment. After that, we actually generated a huge demand, more than we can produce, really,” said Tom Zhu, Tesla’s executive in charge of global production and sales. “And as Elon said, as long as you offer a product with value at affordable price, you don’t have to worry about demand.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/opinions\">opinion</a> on CNN.\n</p>\n    <p>Why do we bury our departed loved ones in a cemetery? A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.</p>\n    <p>But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122521-03-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_256,c_fill\" alt=\"Eric Tourigny\"/>\n    <p>\n            The Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of the <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">country’s first public pet cemetery.</a> Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">50% of families own a pet.</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            How did a city that is <a href=\"https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/barcelona-to-host-spain-s-first-pet-cemetery-11644\">home to 180,000 dogs</a> not already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector, <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.com/20230314/barcelona-to-be-first-city-in-spain-to-create-a-public-pet-cemetery/\">according to</a> Barcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americas <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UvjZDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT29&amp;dq=human+and+animal+space+in+historic+pet+cemeteries+in+london+new+york+and+paris&amp;ots=5DyRzv-Zg6&amp;sig=VwfcnzIu98xlWlqi8eVWtpMN4kw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=human%20and%20animal%20space%20in%20historic%20pet%20cemeteries%20in%20london%20new%20york%20and%20paris&amp;f=false\">since the late 19th century.</a> Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A grave discovery</h2>\n    <p>I became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.</p>\n    <p>This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.</p>\n    <p>This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403122425-02-pet-cemeteries.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"&quot;Darling Sammie,&quot; reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks.\"/>\n    <p>This, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.</p>\n    <p>Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.</p>\n    <p>The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.</p>\n    <h2>A member of the family</h2>\n    <p>Like the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.</p>\n    <p>\n            My <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2020.191\">study of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britain</a> from the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.\n    </p>\n    <p>By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”</p>\n    <p>Society’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”</p>\n    <p>I wonder what the epitaphs in Barcelona’s new cemetery will reveal about modern Catalan relationships with animals.</p>\n    <p>\n            Over time, our ways of treating our animal dead appear to reflect an even closer relationship in life. Once strictly forbidden by law, the last decade saw many jurisdictions, like the state of New York, allowing the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/nyregion/new-york-burial-plots-will-now-allow-four-legged-companions.html\">co-burial of cremated animals and people</a>, which will undoubtedly lead to changing funerary and commemoration practices for both humans and animals.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Modern mourning</h2>\n    <p>For me, the most remarkable similarity between modern and historic pet cemeteries is the striking evidence for the heartbreak and taboos around grieving for animals.</p>\n    <p>The connection that someone has with their pet can be just as strong and just as significant as their relationships with other humans. Yet today, as in over 100 years ago, individuals continue to struggle to find the appropriate outlet to express their pain, hiding heartache for fear of the social repercussions that might come with public acknowledgment of the existence of such a bond.</p>\n    <p>\n            The RSPCA reassures the public <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/pets/bereavement\">on its website</a> that they should not feel shame for their grief. In the UK, charities like the <a href=\"https://www.bluecross.org.uk/pet-bereavement-and-pet-loss\">Blue Cross</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rainbowsbridge.com/grief_support_center/grief_support_home.htm\">Rainbow Bridge Pet Loss Grief Center</a> offer counseling to bereaved humans.\n    </p>\n    <p>Close relationships between people and animals have existed for millennia, but in western European cultures, there were few acceptable ways to mourn that relationship. As society becomes more accepting of the importance of human-animal relationships to our collective wellbeing, it is not surprising to see us follow rituals resembling those we use to mourn the loss of our closest human relationships.</p>\n    <p>At an estimated cost of €200 ($217) per service at the new Barcelona cemetery, it is important to acknowledge that this opportunity to grieve will not be financially available to everyone in the city.</p>\n    <p>\n            This will not be a space for all of the city’s pets. Pet owners may opt to keep cremated remains within their home or spread out ashes in a meaningful location instead. Online forums and <a href=\"https://www.virtualpetcemetery.org/pet/index.html\">digital pet cemeteries</a> also provide other opportunities to commemorate the relationship and express grief.\n    </p>\n    <p>Whether one chooses a pet cemetery or not, there are many acceptable ways to express your grief – and to remember your relationship with the important animals in your life.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/opinions/pet-cemeteries-burying-animals-history-tourigny/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Insane that 60 min would do this.” (Kinzinger is a CNN senior political commentator.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1641971935750832128?s=20\">Molly Jong-Fast also slammed</a> “60 Minutes” with the tweet: “Attention is currency and 60 minutes is spending its currency on the Jewish space lasers woman.” (Jong-Fast was apparently referring to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-republicans.html\">Greene’s past claim </a>that a massive California wildfire was started by “a laser” beamed from space controlled by a prominent Jewish banking family.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/politics/david-hogg-marjorie-taylor-greene-cnntv/index.html\">David Hogg</a>, who survived the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/14/us/florida-high-school-shooting/index.html\">2018 horrific school shooting</a> at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and has since become <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-hogg-on-the-movement-against-gun-violence-five-years-after-parkland/\">an activist </a>against gun violence, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidhogg111/status/1641908169076088832?s=20\">responded</a>, “I look forward to your questions about why she thinks school shootings are fake and why she’s supported QAnon.”  \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/22/marjorie-taylor-greene-parkland-sandyhook/\">Greene amplified the conspiracy theory</a> — two years before being elected to Congress — that the Parkland shooting that took 17 lives was staged. And in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html\">Greene appeared on video </a>confronting Hogg outside the Capitol when he was championing laws to save lives from gun violence, screaming that the then-teenager was a “coward.” She also called Hogg “#littleHitler” on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html\">social media</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1642173628048367616?s=20\">Greene’s own tweet </a>promoting Sunday’s segment was not filled with her typical smears of “fake news” when she doesn’t like the coverage. Rather, Greene urged people to tune in as she praised “60 Minutes” host Stahl (and misspelled her first name): “It was an honor to spend a few days with the legendary icon Leslie Stahl and talented crew @60Minutes.” Greene added, “Leslie is a trailblazer for women in journalism. And while we may disagree on some issues, I respect her greatly.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Now, it is true that “60 Minutes” over its <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-50-years-of-60-minutes/\">50-plus-year history </a>has featured what the show has dubbed “<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-controversial-people-weve-met/\">controversial</a>” guests. These include a 2000 interview with Oklahoma City bomber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUn3XkGZVg\">Timothy McVeigh</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/mcveigh/profile.html\">1995 terrorist attack </a>left 168 dead, including 19 children. And the show did a 1979 interview with Iran’s <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-controversial-people-weve-met/\">Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Perhaps “60 Minutes” views Greene — who has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-armed-insurrection-comments/index.html\">downplayed</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/26/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-jan-6-riot-was-line-with-declaration-independence/\">defended</a> the January 6, 2021, attack plus called for the GOP to become the party of “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/opinions/christian-nationalism-marjorie-taylor-greene-tyler/index.html\">Christian nationalism</a>” — in the vein of its long list of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-controversial-people-weve-met/\">controversial</a> guests. (CBS had not responded to a request from CNN for comment at time of publishing.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            However, the choice of Greene as a guest instantly recalls the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/\">comments</a> of then-CBS CEO Les Moonves during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign when he admitted that Trump’s candidacy “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/leslie-moonves-donald-trump-may-871464/\">Moonves added</a>, “The money’s rolling in and this is fun. … (T)his is going to be a very good year for us,” concluding, “Sorry.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>\n            Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/health/mucosal-immunity-covid-19/index.html\">virus gets its first foothold</a> in the body.\n    </p>\n    <p>In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.</p>\n    <p>Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working. Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.</p>\n    <h2>Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines</h2>\n    <p>The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.</p>\n    <p>As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself. And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.</p>\n    <p>Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.</p>\n    <p>One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.</p>\n    <p>It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.</p>\n    <p>The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.</p>\n    <p>“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do. They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have. Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.</p>\n    <p>The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies. Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.</p>\n    <p>The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.</p>\n    <p>“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <h2>Promising results in animal studies</h2>\n    <p>\n            In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/nmicrobiol/\">Nature Microbiology</a>, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.\n    </p>\n    <p>The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.</p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets.</p>\n    <p>As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted. This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it’s ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging.</p>\n    <p>“They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,” perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research.</p>\n    <p>The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus. In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished. Researchers think it will need an update.</p>\n    <p>It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they’re working on that. The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials.</p>\n    <p>Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been “slow and halting,” Poland said. Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they’re doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.</p>\n    <p>In reality, Poland said, we’re far from that. All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>“That’s foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,” he said.</p>\n    <h2>More on the way</h2>\n    <p>\n            At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines\">according t</a>o the World Health Organization’s vaccine tracker.  \n    </p>\n    <p>The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published.</p>\n    <p>Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.</p>\n    <p>One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>\n    <p>Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus. It’s being developed by a company called Codagenix. Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year.</p>\n    <p>The German team says it’s eagerly watching for the Codagenix data.</p>\n    <p>“They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,” Wyler said.</p>\n    <p>They have reason to worry. Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines.</p>\n    <p>FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn’t help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what’s already there.</p>\n    <h3>Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter</h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://form.cnn.com/results_are_in?source=article\">Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta</a> every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n    </p>\n    <p>Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it’s a promising approach.</p>\n    <p>Another consideration is that live vaccines can’t be taken by everyone. People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them.</p>\n    <p>“Although it’s strongly attenuated, it’s still a real virus,” Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>In a sea of Israeli flags, Yiftach Golov holds one that looks a little different.</p>\n    <p>Among the hundreds of thousands of protesters who took to the streets for the 13th week in a row on Saturday, Golov hoists a brown flag that represents a group called “Brother and Sisters in Arms.”</p>\n    <p>They are veterans – many, like Golov, from elite forces – who now feel they are fighting on a new battlefield: To save Israeli democracy.</p>\n    <p>“We believe this is our responsibility to go once again called to the flag of the nation to stop this madness to defend Israel,” Golov said, as he weaved his way through the protesters on Tel Aviv’s Kaplan street, between the high-rises that house many of Israel’s high tech companies.</p>\n    <p>During the second intifada, in the early 2000s, Golov served in a special forces reconnaissance unit. He was never before particularly political, focusing more on getting his PhD in biophysics from Tel Aviv University.</p>\n    <p>But when the protest movement against the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan began in January, Golov attended one a demonstration and soon became one of thousands of veterans, and now military reservists, who have taken up the cause as their new mission.</p>\n    <p>Some, including elite Air Force reservists, have taken it a step further, threatening not to heed the call to train or even serve in protest of the government’s plans planned judicial changes, which would give the governing parties more control over Israel’s judiciary.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403123500-01-israeli-military-veterans-protest-grab.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"A group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protests by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.\"/>\n    <p>Others have taken to becoming some of the most active organizers and demonstrators. Last week, a group from Brothers and Sisters in Arms protested by carrying a figure wrapped in the Israeli flag on a stretcher, the way they would carry a wounded comrade off the field.</p>\n    <p>While Golov says he has not taken the drastic step to refuse service, he understands the motivation.</p>\n    <p>“We’re fighting for justice and liberty, just like the American story, that’s the values that that are being represented symbolized back when we look at our flag, that’s something that was lacking lacking for the last few decades. So basically, we reclaim the flag,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Fellow members of the group, all wearing brown shirts with the organization’s logo, come up and say hello. They’re sprinkled all throughout the protests. One is even leading the “Pink Front,” a group of coordinated drummers who look like they are dressed for a rave, and often lead the chants at the protests.</p>\n    <p>They’re using skills they learned in the military – how to organize, how to mobilize – now for the protests. But more importantly, they say they have the same type of motivation.</p>\n    <p>“The very deep feeling that you are part of something bigger than yourself, that (you’re) allowed to sacrifice anything that is needed, whether it’s your career, health, seriously mental health,” Golov said. “We all have a mission, you’re willing to do it at any cost. You’re very determined, you know that you are on the right side, you’re carrying the torch of light. That keeps us being highly motivated despite the fact that we’re not sleeping for days.”</p>\n    <p>Israel’s protest movement is made up of many disparate groups, but the pressure from Israel’s much vaunted veterans has been seen as a key to moving the needle.</p>\n    <p>Last Monday, after weeks of sustained protests and the largest general strike in Israeli history, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a pause to the legislation, to allow time for negotiations with the opposition.</p>\n    <p>But despite the announcements, protesters are still out in the streets in large numbers. CNN affiliate Channel 12 in Israel estimated the size of Saturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv at about 150,000 people. Organizers claimed it was 230,000.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230327154938-06-israel-protests-0327.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"Israelis protest during a demonstration after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Jerusalem, on March 27, 2023. \"/>\n    <p>\n            Last week’s mass protests and widespread strike action came after Netanyahu said he had decided to fire Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for advocating a delay in passing the legislation – a move that Netanyahu has since delayed, sources told CNN, due to “the present security situation.” <strong> </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>In his televised speech calling for a delay, Gallant had said the pause in the legislation was needed “for the security of Israel,” citing the refusal of some Israel Defense Forces reservists to train in protest of the government plans. He said pressing ahead with the proposals could threaten Israel’s security.</p>\n    <p>Under pressure at home and from allies abroad, Netanyahu said he would delay votes on the remaining legislation until after the Knesset’s Passover recess in April “to give time for a real chance for a real debate.”</p>\n    <p>“Out of the responsibility to the nation, I decided to delay … the vote, in order to give time for discussion,” he added.</p>\n    <p>But Netanyahu indicated that the delay was only temporary. He insisted that the overhaul was necessary, and reiterated criticism of refusal to train or serve in the military in protest at the planned changes. “Refusing is the end of our country,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Many protesters don’t believe that the pause is real, or say it’s simply a stalling tactic to give Netanyahu some breathing room and get the protesters to go home before he plows on with the reforms.</p>\n    <p>“We will start doing deactivation only when we will know 100% that Israel state will stay a functional democratic country. Whatever needs to be done for that,” Golov said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/israel-protests-military-veterans-intl-cmd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n    <strong>Editor’s Note: </strong><i>A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. </i><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/newsletters/meanwhile-in-middle-east\"> Sign up here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n            Turkey’s persecuted <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/world/2015/06/09/intv-amanpour-selahattin-demirtas-coalition.cnn\">pro-Kurdish party</a> has emerged as a kingmaker in the country’s upcoming election, playing a decisive role that may just tip the balance enough to unseat two-decade ruler <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/01/27/middleeast/turkey-elections-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>.  \n    </p>\n<p>In a key setback to the Turkish president and leader of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party), the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) last month announced that it would not put forward its own presidential candidate, a move analysts say allows its supporters to vote for Erdogan’s main rival.</p>\n<p>\n            “We are facing a turning point that will shape the future of Turkey and (its) society,” said the HDP in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HDPenglish/status/1638870402364747776\">statement on March 23</a>. “To fulfill our historical responsibility against the one-man rule, we will not field a presidential candidate in (the) May 14 elections.” \n    </p>\n<p>\n            It is a twist of irony for the Turkish strongman, who spent the better half of the past decade cracking down on the party after it began chipping away at his voter base. Its former leader <a href=\"https://cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/07/22/exp-ctw-selahattin-demirtas.cnn\">Selahattin Demirtas</a> has been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics. \n    </p>\n<p>\n            The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">Kemal Kilicdaroglu</a>, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media. \n    </p>\n<p>Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.</p>\n<p>“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”</p>\n<p>\n            Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds, <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/03/08/middleeast/turkey-presidential-candidate-erdogan-mime-intl/index.html\">an ethnic minority</a> from which a separatist militant movement has emerged.  \n    </p>\n<p>The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.</p>\n<p>But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.</p>\n<p>Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.</p>\n<h2>Precarious position</h2>\n<p>The accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.</p>\n<p>If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoration of the AK Party’s overall majority.</p>\n<p>“They are a kingmaker in these elections because the HDP gets about half of the votes of the Kurdish population in Turkey,” said Somer, adding that the other, more conservative Kurdish voters have traditionally voted for Erdogan’s AK Party. And last month, the Free Cause Party (HUDA-PAR), a tiny Kurdish-Islamist party announced support for Erdogan in the elections. The party has never won seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>The HDP knows that its position is key to the outcome of next month’s vote, but that it’s also in a delicate situation.</p>\n<p>“We want to play the game wisely, and we need to be very careful,” said Ozsoy, adding that the party wants to avoid a “contaminated political climate” where the elections are polarized “between a very ugly ultra-nationalist discourse against Kilicdaroglu and others.”</p>\n<p>The party was founded in 2012 with a number of aims, said Ozsoy, one of which was “peaceful and democratic resolution of the Kurdish conflict.”</p>\n<p>Somer said that the party was seen to be “an initiative” of the PKK, which later led to a heavy government crackdown on it in the name of counterterrorism.</p>\n<p>Its former leader Demirtas remains an influential figure.</p>\n<p>The Turkish government has been trying to link the HDP to the PKK but has so far failed to prove “a real connection,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p>A post-Erdogan Turkey may give some breathing space to the Kurds and Kurdish-dominated parties in Turkey, Aydintasbas told CNN, noting that many Kurdish voters have recently left Erdogan’s camp. “For HDP, this is more than just an ideological choice,” she said. “It’s a matter of survival.”</p>\n<p>Ozsoy says his party understands what’s at stake, not only for Turkey’s Kurds but for all its minorities.</p>\n<p>“We are aware of our responsibility here. We are aware of our role. We know we are in a kingmaker position,” the HDP lawmaker said.</p>\n<h2>\n        <strong>The digest </strong>\n</h2>\n<p>\n            <strong>Two women arrested for not wearing hijab following ‘yogurt attack’ </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/middleeast/women-arrested-hijab-yogurt-iran-intl/index.html\">Two women were arrested</a> in Iran for failing to wear the hijab in public, after a man threw a tub of yogurt at them at a store in the city of Shandiz on Thursday, according to Mizan News Agency, the state-run outlet for Iran’s judiciary. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: A video and report published by the Mizan News Agency<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/04/03/man-throws-yogurt-on-women-iran-president-raisi-hijab-is-law-nada-bashir-ovn-intl-ldn-vpx.cnn\">showed footage of the man</a>approaching one of the unveiled women and speaking to her before he grabs a tub of yogurt and throws it, hitting both women on the head. The video appears to show a male staff member removing the man from the store. The two women were arrested, as well as the man who threw the yogurt, according to local media.</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters</i>: Iranians have taken to the streets in protest for several months against Iran’s mandatory hijab law, as well as other political and social issues across the country. The Iranian government has continued to crack down on the protests, and on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said that the “hijab is an unquestionable religious necessity.”</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Oil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cuts </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://cnn.com/2023/04/02/business/opec-production-cuts/index.html\">Oil prices spiked Monday</a> after OPEC+ producers unexpectedly announced that they would cut output. Brent crude, the global benchmark, jumped 5.31% to $84.13 a barrel, while WTI, the US benchmark, rose 5.48% to $79.83. Both were the sharpest price rises in almost a year. The collective output cut by the nine members of OPEC+ totals 1.66 million barrels per day. \n    </p>\n<ul><li>\n        \n            <i>Background</i>: The reductions are on top of the 2 million barrels per day (bpd) cuts announced by OPEC+ in October and bring the total volume of cuts by OPEC+ to 3.66 million bpd, equal to 3.7% of global demand. In a note Sunday, Goldman Sachs analysts said the move was unexpected but “consistent with the new OPEC+ doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can, without significant losses in market share.”</li><li>\n        \n            <i>Why it matters:</i>The White House pushed back on the cuts by OPEC+. “We don’t think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty – and we’ve made that clear,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council said. “We’re focused on prices for American consumers, not barrels.” In October, OPEC+’s decision to cut production had already rankled the White House. US President Joe Biden pledged at the time that Saudi Arabia would suffer “consequences.” But so far, his administration appears to have backed off on its vows to punish the kingdom.</li></ul>\n<p>\n            <strong>Iran blames Israel for the killing of second IRGC officer, vows to respond  </strong> \n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/middleeast/kurdish-kingmaker-turkish-elections-mime-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Shares in China Renaissance have plunged since Bao went missing, at one point dropping as much as 50%.\n    </p>\n    <p>China Renaissance said in late February that it had learned Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” being carried out by certain authorities in the country. It gave no other details.</p>\n    <p>\n            Chinese media have <a href=\"http://www.myzaker.com/article/63ef44bd8e9f09317c41165c\">reported</a> Bao might be assisting in an investigation related to a former executive at China Renaissance. \n    </p>\n    <p>In a filing on Sunday, China Renaissance said auditors couldn’t complete their work or sign off on their report because of Bao’s absence. The board was also unable to give an estimate about when it would be able to approve its audited results for 2022 or dispatch its annual report by an April 30 deadline as required by Hong Kong’s listing rules.</p>\n    <p>Trading in the company’s shares was suspended from Monday as a result.</p>\n    <p>\n            Bao is known as a veteran dealmaker<strong> </strong>who works closely with top technology companies in China. He helped broker the 2015 merger between two of the country’s leading food delivery services, Meituan and Dianping.

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.</p>\n    <p>Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.</p>\n    <p>A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”</p>\n    <p>\n            The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/politics/spy-balloon-technology/index.html\">officials have said</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/politics/us-balloon-tracking-method/index.html\">developed a method of tracking</a> what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n    </p>\n    <p>The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.</p>\n    <p>\n            CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/china-spy-balloon-collected-intelligence-us-military-bases-rcna77155\">first to report</a> on the new intelligence.\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323180902-justin-trudeau.jpg?c=16x9&amp;q=w_1280,c_fill\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau\"/>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/04/politics/china-spy-balloon-us-latest/index.html\">eventually shot down</a> by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n    </p>\n    <p>A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”</p>\n    <p>Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”</p>\n    <p>The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/politics/us-tracking-china-spy-balloon/index.html\">reported</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.</p>\n    <p>\n            <i>This story has been updated with additional reporting.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/politics/chinese-spy-balloon/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.</p>\n    <p>Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.</p>\n    <p>Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>\n            France is currently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/europe/france-pension-reform-protests-biarritz-airport-intl/index.html\">in the throes of a political and social crisis</a> triggered by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/20/world/macron-france-pension-no-confidence-intl/index.html\">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>“We are in the middle of a social crisis, there is the issue of policing, there are people between life and death, and I have the impression of being behind a smoke screen,” Sandrine Rousseau, Green Party politician and fellow women’s rights activist, told BFMTV Friday.</p>\n    <p>French politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.</p>\n    <p>“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.</p>\n    <p>Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”</p>\n    <p>French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”</p>\n    <p>“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/french-minister-playboy-cover-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That’s an excellent achievement, even if we did not finish first today,” the prime minister said in a speech to party members.</p>\n    <p>\n            Marin, 37, the world’s youngest prime minister when she took office in 2019, is considered by fans around the globe as a millennial role model for progressive new leaders, but at home she has faced criticism for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/europe/sanna-marin-finland-partying-video-intl/index.html\">her partying</a> and her government’s public spending.\n    </p>\n    <p>While she remains very popular among many Finns, particularly young moderates, she antagonized some conservatives with lavish spending on pensions and education they see as not frugal enough.</p>\n    <p>The NCP has led in polls for almost two years although its lead had melted away in recent months. It has promised to curb spending and stop the rise of public debt, which has reached just over 70% of GDP since Marin took office in 2019.</p>\n    <p>Orpo accused Marin of eroding Finland’s economic resilience at a time when Europe’s energy crisis, driven by Russia’s war in Ukraine, has hit the country hard and the cost of living has increased.</p>\n    <p>Orpo has said he will negotiate with all groups to obtain a majority in parliament, while Marin has said her Social Democrats may govern with the NCP but will not go into government with the Finns Party.</p>\n    <p>Marin called the Finns Party “openly racist” during a debate in January – an accusation the nationalist group rejected.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230402171721-02-finland-election-petteri-orpo.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill\" alt=\"The National Coalition Chairman Petteri Orpo celebrates with supporters following the Finnish parliamentary elections, on April 2, 2023, in Helsinki.\"/>\n    <p>The Finns Party’s main goal is to reduce what leader Riikka Purra has called “harmful” immigration from developing countries outside the European Union. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending, a stance it shares with the NCP.</p>\n    <p>\n            Most notable of Marin’s foreign policy actions has been her push, along with President Sauli Niinisto, for the country to make a watershed policy U-turn by seeking NATO membership in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/specials/europe/ukraine\">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>That process is now almost complete, with Helsinki expected to join within days after all the Western defense alliance’s 30 members approved the accession.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/02/europe/sanna-marin-finland-elections-concedes-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n            The Biden administration managed to rack up a long list of major legislative wins in its first two years despite facing one of the most closely-divided Congresses in history.<br/>From bipartisan action on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/politics/infrastructure-bill-explained/index.html\">infrastructure</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/politics/senate-bipartisan-gun-bill/index.html\">gun safety</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html\">same-sex marriage</a> to party-line bills tackling <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/07/politics/senate-democrats-climate-health-care-bill-vote/index.html\">climate change and expanding health care coverage</a>, it’s a record President Joe Biden and Democrats on the ballot were all eager to tout on the campaign trail during the midterms. \n    </p>\n<p>But far from the spotlight is a woman who helped make all that happen: Louisa Terrell.</p>\n<p>As the director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, Terrell, 53, leads a team that is the president’s collective eyes and ears in Congress.</p>\n<p>“Making sure we’re responding, making sure we’re being proactive, figuring out what’s happening here in this building,” Terrell told CNN, explaining her job while standing in front of the Capitol, where she spends a considerable amount of time even though she works for the White House.</p>\n<p>She describes her role as a conductor for moving Biden’s agenda through Congress.</p>\n<p>“You want to be talking to committees, caucuses. Who’s talking to leadership? Who are the up-and-comers? What’s the floor action? What’s running quickly? What’s slowing down? And you need all these sort of tentacles out there, and then bringing that back every day.”</p>\n<p>But unlike an actual conductor who is front and center of an orchestra, Terrell operates very much behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>In fact, when we sat down for our conversation in the White House Executive Office Building, she said it was her first television interview – ever.</p>\n<p>Terrell’s years of experience in Washington have been critical to her success. She first started on the Hill over 20 years ago as a staffer for then-Sen. Biden on the Judiciary Committee. Looking back, she describes herself at the time as being just a “gal from Delaware,” in awe of the experienced legal clerks and seasoned staffers surrounding her. She quickly found her footing and thrived, going on to serve as Biden’s deputy chief of staff and later worked in the Obama administration’s Office of Legal Affairs – the very team she now leads.</p>\n<p>Even with her expansive resume, however, Terrell readily admits that today’s Washington is tougher to navigate than the one she first arrived in two decades ago.</p>\n<p>“The extremes have gotten extreme and I think that makes it harder,” she said. “You have to really work a lot harder to find where you can meet in the middle.”</p>\n<p>Being able to call on the personal relationships she’s forged over the years on Capitol Hill proved critical to working across the aisle to find that middle ground, particularly given Democrats’ razor-thin majorities.</p>\n<p>“I’ll be very clear on what the president’s position is and why we want to see what we want to see done,” she said of her conversations with Republican lawmakers. “Republicans know that when this White House – and whether it’s us on our team or a senior official – gives the word, then we stand by our word. And I think that kind of credibility on the Hill has been very important to move things.”</p>\n<p>Deep relationships matter too, she said.</p>\n<p>“You get fuel from the other people you work with. And I get an incredible amount of fuel from the senior team here at the White House and just people who have years and years of experience and relationships in those matters.”</p>\n<p>It’s the kind of work that can make or break a president, and even though it’s largely unheralded, that doesn’t mean it goes unnoticed. Following her confirmation to the Supreme Court as its first Black justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson included Terrell in her shout-outs as one of the “brilliant folks” who helped make the historic achievement possible.</p>\n<h2>A lifelong Biden connection</h2>\n<p>Terrell’s longest relationship in the White House is with the president himself. Though their professional relationship started when she came to Washington two decades ago, she first met Biden when she was just 5 years old.</p>\n<p>“I met Beau Biden in kindergarten,” Terrell, who is from Wilmington, recalled with a smile. “It (was) a very quick bike ride from my house to where Beau grew up. So we were childhood friends (and) stayed friends for … all our adulthood.”</p>\n<p>She remembers visiting the Biden household as a kid, sharing with CNN a running joke from her childhood.</p>\n<p>“When we would go to Beau’s house, there was a fax machine in the living room and all you needed to know (was), do not screw up the fax machine,” she says with a laugh. “And again, this is Delaware and it was probably the first fax machine in Delaware, this is high tech equipment.”</p>\n<p>Terrell’s lifelong relationship with the Biden family means she brings a unique perspective to her work in the White House.</p>\n<p>“He knows my folks and just being connected that way,” she said. “You know where the person came from and I think that helps.”</p>\n<p>“It brings a warmth to the work and I feel very, very lucky about that,” she added.</p>\n<p>\n            Terrell said her friend Beau, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/obit-vice-president-son-beau-biden/index.html\">died of a brain tumor in 2015</a>, is always on her mind.\n    </p>\n<p>“You want to represent what … the President wants you to do,” she said. “And then there’s always this other question of, what would Beau do? And I think of those things as kind of intertwined and they’re part of the background driver of how we do the work.”</p>\n<h2>Paying it forward for women</h2>\n<p>Two years into her work on the Judiciary Committee, Terrell became pregnant. She says Biden’s office maintained a family-first culture. But as she continued her career in Washington, her kids got a bit older, and the balancing act became more complicated.</p>\n<p>“I had the job in the Obama administration when my kids were say, like, around 6 and 8 – or 4 and 6. It’s all a little bit of a blur,” she joked.</p>\n<p>She describes her time after work as “bed, bath and beyond,” an entire “second shift” after a full day at the office. It’s something she’s extra mindful of now, as a senior woman in the administration.</p>\n<p>“I look across the White House, the women whose kids are that age, and you really have to (remember) how long their days and their nights are,” Terrell said. “And then to think about the kind of performance and the kind of 100% they’re giving at the office every day. I have so much gratitude and admiration.”</p>\n<p>Women having a seat at the table is not just a phrase in Terrell’s office. When CNN stopped by one of her team meetings in the West Wing, the room was packed with young staffers – mostly women. Terrell says that was a conscious decision, not because of their gender, but because they were the best for the job.</p>\n<p>“(The) expectation is, be ready to contribute. And that’s kind of what I mean – be prepared and ready to play,” she said of the more junior staff. “Don’t be afraid to do that.”</p>\n<p>But when asked what advice she would give to young women starting out in government today, Terrell didn’t hesitate.</p>\n<p>“I think that women today are way braver than I was,” she said. “It’s really impressive. So, I kind of think they don’t need my advice, actually, so, yeah, they don’t need me. I’m just happy to have drinks and coffee with them when they’ll take me,” she said with a laugh.</p>\n<h2>New challenges ahead</h2>\n<p>Terrell and her team are knee-deep in negotiations for the final weeks of a Democratic House majority, which means competing priorities for the rest of the lame duck session – the most important of which is Congress’ basic function of funding the government.</p>\n<p>As some Democrats tried to squeeze in legislation to regulate social media companies, Terrell’s stint at Facebook raised some questions among some advocacy groups, though Terrell maintains her stint at the tech giant 10 years ago doesn’t conflict with the president’s legislative agenda.</p>\n<p>“I think the president kind of came into office and campaigned on this about a very pro-competition, pro-accountability and pro-transparency in social media platforms, which obviously, what they are today is not what they were 10 years ago. So we worked really hard, I think, to promote those executive actions, the regulatory actions, the people that we brought into the administration to work on those, and worked hard on legislative pieces, and hope to continue to do that next year.”</p>\n<p>\n            And though the Democratic majority in the Senate will slightly expand in January, Terrell’s office is on the front lines preparing for Republicans to take over the House and launch a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/house-republicans-white-house-hunter-biden/index.html\">wave of congressional investigations into Biden officials</a>.\n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/politics/louisa-terrell-legislative-director/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Kyrsten Sinema </a>decided to shake up the political world on Friday by becoming an independent. The former Democrat is still caucusing with the party in the Senate, so the Democratic caucus still has 51 members. Now, instead of 49 Democrats and two independents within their ranks, the caucus has 48 Democrats and three independents. \n    </p>\n    <p>But that simple math hides a more clouded picture for Democrats and for Sinema herself. Sinema’s interests are no longer necessarily the Democrats’ best interests in the next Congress, and the 2024 Senate map became even more complicated for Democrats with Sinema’s decision.</p>\n    <p>\n            To be clear, Sinema has always been a thorn in the Democrats side during her time in Congress. Over the last two years, Democrats have had to almost always make sure that any bill or nomination had Sinema’s support to have any chance of passing. That’s the math when you have only 50 Senate seats in a 100-seat chamber. A lot of bills and nominations <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/2022/03/01/party-unity-vote-studies-underscore-polarized-state-of-the-union/\">were never voted on</a> without Sinema and Manchin’s backing. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            From 2013 (Sinema’s first term in Congress) to 2020, Sinema <a href=\"https://media.cq.com/votewatch/\">voted against her party </a>more than almost any other member of Congress. She stayed with the party about 69% of the time on votes where at least one half of the Democrats voted differently than half of Republicans. The average Democrat voted with their party about 90% of the time on these votes. \n    </p>\n    <p>It’s quite possible that Sinema’s percentage of sticking with the party will lower now that she is an independent. Consider the example of former Sen. Joe Lieberman. The longtime Democrat won reelection as a third-party candidate in 2006, after losing the Democratic primary to a left-wing challenger (the now fairly moderate Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont)</p>\n    <p>Relative to the average Senate Democrat, Lieberman voted with the party 10 points less of the time after becoming an independent than he had in his last term as a Democrat. If that happens with Sinema, she’ll become even more conservative than West Virginia’s Joe Manchin (the most conservative member of the Democratic caucus).</p>\n    <p>This would make sense because the incentive structure is now very different for Sinema. Ahead of a 2024 reelection campaign, she no longer has to worry about winning a Democratic primary. Sinema has to worry about building a coalition of Democrats, independents and Republicans. That is far more difficult to do if you’re seen as too liberal.</p>\n    <p>\n            Indeed, the big reason Sinema became an independent is because it would have been very difficult to win a Democratic primary. Her approval rating among Arizona Democrats in an<a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\"> autumn 2022 CES</a> poll stood at just 25%. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/09/sinema-party-arizona-senate-2024-00073301\">A number of Democrats</a> (e.g. Rep. Ruben Gallego and Rep. Greg Stanton) were already lining up to potentially challenge her in a primary. \n    </p>\n    <p>A question now is whether Sinema’s decision to become an independent will dissuade some of those Democrats from running. The idea being that Sinema still caucuses with the Democrats, and Democrats wouldn’t want to split the Democratic vote in a general election allowing a Republican to win in a purple state like Arizona.</p>\n    <p>It’s an interesting bet from Sinema. After all, Democrats usually don’t run a candidate against independent Sen. Bernie Sanders in Vermont. The Democrats who run against independent Sen. Angus King in Maine have not gained traction in recent elections. Don’t forget the aforementioned Lieberman won as a third-party candidate.</p>\n    <p>The electoral math structure was and is totally different in these circumstances, however. Sanders wouldn’t attract a left-wing Democratic challenger because he is already so progressive. Lieberman declared his third-party candidacy after the primary, so Republicans didn’t have time to find a well-known challenger. Republicans also knew that Lieberman, who was an ardent supporter of the Iraq War, was probably the best they could hope for in the deeply Democratic state of Connecticut.</p>\n    <p>This leaves the King example. King, like Sinema, is a moderate from not a deeply blue or red state. There’s just one problem for Sinema in this analogy: King is popular. He had previously won the governorship twice as an independent and has almost always sported high favorables.</p>\n    <p>\n            Sinema is not popular at all. The <a href=\"https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data\">CES poll</a> had her approval rating below her disapproval rating with Democrats, independents and Republicans in Arizona. Sinema’s overall approval stood at 25% to a disapproval rating of 58%. Other polling isn’t nearly as dire for Sinema, but the average of it all has her firmly being more unpopular than popular. \n    </p>\n    <p>Put another way, Sinema’s current numbers are probably not going to scare off many challengers from either the Democratic or Republican side. Additionally, there’s zero reason for Democrats to cede the ground to Sinema because it would keep a Republican from winning. It isn’t clear at all that Sinema can win as an independent.</p>\n    <p>What Sinema’s move did accomplish is that it made the electoral math a lot more complicated in Arizona and therefore nationally. Having two people in the race who are going to caucus with the Democratic Party likely makes it more difficult for the Democrats to win.</p>\n    <p>One potential worrisome example for Democrats in a purple state (at least then) was the 2010 Florida Senate race. Then Republican Gov. Charlie Crist decided to run as an independent after it became clear he wouldn’t beat the more conservative Republican Marco Rubio in a Republican primary. Crist, who said he would caucus with the Democrats, split the Democratic vote with then Rep. Kendrick Meek, and Rubio cruised to a win.</p>\n    <p>I should point out that Democrats certainly have a chance. The 1968 Alaska Senate race, for example, featured two Democrats (Mike Gravel and then Sen. Ernest Gruening as write-in). Gravel won in the state which Republican Richard Nixon carried, too, by a few points.</p>\n    <p>In 2024, Arizona Republicans could nominate an extreme candidate that flames out. They just lost every major statewide race in 2022 because of who they nominated.</p>\n    <p>\n            Don’t dismiss the possibility too that Sinema could win like Harry Byrd did in the <a href=\"https://vig.coopercenter.org/sites/vig/files/Virginia_News_Letter_1971_Vol._48_No._2.pdf\">1970 Virginia Senate election</a> when both parties nominated candidates. Maybe voters will like Sinema’s new independent registration. \n    </p>\n    <p>Sinema also could find herself flaming out when running in the general election without a major party backing her like Gruening did in 1968 or then Sen. Jacob Javits in the 1980 New York Senate race.</p>\n    <p>We just don’t know.</p>\n    <p>All that said, the Democrats already have a difficult map heading into 2024. Depending on whether the Democrats win the presidency (and have a Democratic vice president who can break Senate ties), they can afford to lose zero to one Senate seats and maintain a majority.</p>\n    <p>The vast majority, 23 of the 34, senators up for reelection in 2024 caucus with the Democrats. An abnormally large number (7) represent states Republican Donald Trump won at least once. This includes Arizona.</p>\n    <p>With Sinema’s break from the Democratic party, the road is, if nothing else, curvier for Democrats.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/politics/kyrsten-sinema-independent-democrats/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He alleges a “witch hunt” against him. But each trial has its own distinct storyline to follow.</p>\n<p>\n            Here’s an updated list of developments in Trump’s very complicated set of court cases, beginning with the one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-fraud-trial-new-york-10-02-23\">playing out in Manhattan</a> this week.\n    </p>\n<h2>New York state civil court: $250 million fraud case</h2>\n<p>The civil fraud trial, unlike Trump’s multiple criminal indictments, does not carry the danger of a felony conviction and jail time, but it could very well cost him some of his most prized possessions, including Trump Tower.</p>\n<p>\n            New York Attorney General Letitia James brought the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/politics/letitia-james-trump-lawsuit-takeaways-what-to-know/index.html\">$250 million lawsuit</a> in September 2022, alleging that Trump and his co-defendants committed repeated fraud in inflating assets on financial statements to get better terms on commercial real estate loans and insurance policies.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Judge Arthur Engoron <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/trump-organization-business-fraud/index.html\">has already ruled</a> that Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud for inflating the value of his golf courses, hotels and homes on financial statements to secure loans.\n    </p>\n<p>The trial portion of the case, playing out in court in Manhattan, will assess what damages will be levied against Trump and how Engoron’s decision to strip Trump of his New York business licenses will play out.</p>\n<h2>Federal civil court in New York: E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit</h2>\n<p>\n            In May, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/09/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-lawsuit-battery-defamation-verdict/index.html\">a federal jury in Manhattan found</a> Trump sexually abused former advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in a luxury department store dressing room in the mid-1990s and awarded her about $5 million.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            A separate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/politics/e-jean-carroll-trump-defamation-lawsuit/index.html\">civil defamation lawsuit</a> will only need to decide how much money Trump has to pay her. That case for January 15 – the same day Iowa Republicans will hold their caucuses, the first date on the presidential primary calendar.\n    </p>\n<h2>Federal criminal court in DC: 2020 election Interference</h2>\n<p>\n            In August, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel/index.html\">special counsel Jack Smith</a>’s investigation into the aftermath of the 2020 election. The former president was arraigned in a Washington, DC, courtroom, where he pleaded not guilty. \n    </p>\n<p>The case is based in part on a scheme to create slates of fake electors in key states won by President Joe Biden.</p>\n<p>\n            In late September, Judge Tanya Chutkan <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/27/politics/tanya-chutkan-donald-trump-recusal-motion/index.html\">rejected Trump’s request</a> that she recuse herself from the case. Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, has overseen civil and criminal cases related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection and has repeatedly exceeded what prosecutors have requested for convicted rioters’ prison sentences.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Chutkan set the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/28/politics/trump-january-6-criminal-case-trial-date-hearing/index.html\">trial’s start date</a> for March 4, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when the largest batch of presidential primaries will occur. The trial marks the first of Trump’s criminal cases expected to proceed. \n    </p>\n<h2>New York criminal court: Hush money payments</h2>\n<p>Trump has been charged in Manhattan criminal court with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to his role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels late in the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>\n            The former president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/politics/donald-trump-arraignment-new-york/index.html\">pleaded not guilty</a> at his April arraignment in Manhattan.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            Prosecutors, led by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/19/politics/alvin-bragg-manhattan-district-attorney-trump/index.html\">Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg</a>, accuse Trump of falsifying business records with the intent to conceal $130,000 in payments to Daniels made by former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen to guarantee her silence about an alleged affair.\n    </p>\n<p>Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels.</p>\n<p>\n            The trial was originally scheduled to begin in late March 2024, but Judge Juan Merchan has suggested the date could move. The <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2023/09/18/politics/stormy-daniels-trump-attorney-judge-conflict/index.html\">next court date</a> is scheduled for February.\n    </p>\n<h2>Georgia criminal court: Efforts to overturn election results</h2>\n<p>\n            Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is using racketeering violations to charge a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/17/politics/trump-georgia-election-indictment-what-to-know/index.html\">broad criminal conspiracy</a> against Trump and 18 others in their efforts to overturn Biden’s victory in Georgia.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            The probe was launched in 2021 following Trump’s call that January with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which the president <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/03/politics/trump-brad-raffensperger-phone-call-transcript/index.html\">pushed the Republican official to “find” votes</a> to overturn the election results. \n    </p>\n<p>The August indictment also includes how Trump’s team allegedly misled state officials in Georgia; organized fake electors; harassed an election worker; and breached election equipment in rural Coffee County, Georgia.</p>\n<p>\n            One co-defendant, bail bondsman Scott Hall, has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/fulton-county-election-plea-scott-hall/index.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to five counts in the case.\n    </p>\n<p>Fulton County prosecutors have signaled they could offer plea deals to other co-defendants.</p>\n<p>\n            Willis this week <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/02/politics/bernie-kerik-fulton-county/index.html\">issued a subpoena</a> to former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump ally, who in turn demanded an immunity deal in exchange for testimony.\n    </p>\n<p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/29/politics/powell-chesebro-georgia-trial-plea-deals/index.html\">Trial for two co-defendants</a> is expected to begin this month and could last three to five months. A trial date has not been set for Trump, who has pleaded not guilty.\n    </p>\n<h2>Federal criminal court in Florida: Mishandling classified material</h2>\n<p>\n            Trump has pleaded not guilty to 37 federal charges brought by Smith over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Smith added<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/politics/trump-mar-a-lago-special-counsel/index.html\"> three additional counts </a>in a superseding indictment. \n    </p>\n<p>The investigation centers on sensitive documents that Trump brought to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his White House term ended in January 2021.</p>\n<p>The National Archives, charged with collecting and sorting presidential material, has previously said that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from Mar-a-Lago, including some classified records.</p>\n<p>\n            Trump was also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/politics/trump-classified-documents-audio/index.html\">caught on tape</a> in a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the former president discussed holding secret documents he did not declassify.\n    </p>\n<p>Smith’s additional charges allege that Trump and his employees attempted to delete Mar-a-Lago security footage sought by the grand jury investigating the mishandling of the records.</p>\n<p>Trial is not expected until May, after most presidential primaries have concluded.</p>\n<p>\n            <strong>There are other cases to note:</strong>\n    </p>\n<h2>Trump Organization: Convicted of criminal tax fraud</h2>\n<p>\n            Trump’s namesake business, the Trump Organization, was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html\">convicted in December</a> by a New York jury of tax fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records in what prosecutors say was a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation provided to employees.\n    </p>\n<p>Manhattan prosecutors told a jury the case was about “greed and cheating,” laying out a scheme within the Trump Organization to pay high-level executives in perks such as luxury cars and apartments without paying taxes on them.</p>\n<p>\n            Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/politics/allen-weisselberg-pleads-guilty/index.html\">pleaded guilty</a> to his role in the tax scheme. He was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/19/politics/allen-weisselberg-released-rikers/index.html\">released</a> after serving four months in jail at Rikers Island.\n    </p>\n<h2>January 6: Lawsuits by police officers</h2>\n<p>\n            Several members of the US Capitol Police and Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/capitol-police-trump-mehta/index.html\">are suing Trump</a>, saying his words and actions incited the 2021 riot. \n    </p>\n<p>The various cases accuse Trump of directing assault and battery; aiding and abetting assault and battery; and violating Washington laws that prohibit the incitement of riots and disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p>\n            In August, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/politics/trump-sicknick-lawsuit/index.html\">Trump requested</a> to put on hold the lawsuit related to the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, citing his various criminal trials. The estate of Sicknick, who died after responding to the attack on the Capitol, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/05/politics/sicknick-lawsuit-trump-january-6/index.html\">is suing</a> two rioters involved in the attack and Trump for his alleged role in egging it on.\n    </p>\n<p>Other lawsuits have been put on hold while a federal appeals court considers whether Trump had absolute immunity as the sitting president.</p>\n<h2>Personal retaliation: Peter Strzok lawsuit</h2>\n<p>\n            Former top FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/13/politics/peter-strzok-fired-fbi/index.html\">who was fired</a> in 2018 after the revelation that he criticized Trump in text messages, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/politics/peter-strzok-sues-back-pay-job-trump/index.html\">sued</a> the Justice Department, alleging he was terminated improperly. \n    </p>\n<p>In summer 2017, former special counsel Robert Mueller removed Strzok from his team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election after an internal investigation revealed texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page that could be read as exhibiting political bias.</p>\n<p>Strzok and Page were constant targets of verbal attacks by Trump and his allies, part of the larger ire the then-president expressed toward the FBI during the Russia investigation. Trump repeatedly and publicly called for Strzok’s ouster until he was fired in August 2018.</p>\n<p>\n            Trump is set to be <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/28/government-shutdown-trump-deposition-00118927\">deposed this month</a> as part of the case, according to Politico. \n    </p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/donald-trump-investigations-lawsuits/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free </i><i>here</i><i>. </i>\n</p>\n    <p>\n            Let’s start with the positive: Republicans and Democrats are coming together to protect same-sex<strong> </strong>marriage from the Supreme Court. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The Respect for Marriage Act<strong> </strong>codifies marriages and came about amid worries among Democrats that the same conservative majority on the Supreme Court that took away the right to abortion will target same-sex marriage in the future.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            The version that overcame a filibuster in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/same-sex-marriage-vote-senate/index.html\">passed the Senate Tuesday</a>. A dozen Republican senators from across the country voted with Democrats before Thanksgiving to limit debate and move toward a final vote. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/politics/senate-republicans-vote-same-sex-marriage\">RELATED: Meet the 12 Republicans who voted to consider the Respect for Marriage Act</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>It next goes to the House for approval before President Joe Biden can sign it into law.</p>\n    <p>But there is a fair amount of fine print.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>First, the bill does not require all states to allow same-sex marriage,</strong> even though that is the current reality under the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Rather, if the Supreme Court overturned Obergefell and previous state prohibitions on same-sex marriage came back into effect, the Respect for Marriage Act would require states and the federal government to respect marriages conducted in places where it is legal.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>There are religious exceptions. </strong>Republican supporters have emphasized the elements in this Senate version that protect nonprofit and religious organizations from having to provide support for same-sex marriages.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “I will be supporting the substitute amendment because it will ensure our religious freedoms are upheld and protected, one of the bedrocks of our democracy,” said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito <a href=\"https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-votes-to-advance-consideration-of-the-respect-for-marriage-act-plans-to-support-substitute-amendment\">in a statement</a> after helping break the filibuster.\n    </p>\n    <p>It took months of behind-the-scenes effort to bring 10-plus Republicans on board.</p>\n    <p>\n            <strong>This is all academic right now.</strong> The bill is only being passed in case the now-solidly conservative Supreme Court, which has taken delight in upending precedent, were to revisit the Obergefell v. Hodges decision that created a national right to marriage for same-sex couples.\n    </p>\n    <p>Two of the justices who voted in favor of that ruling have been replaced by Republican-appointed conservatives, which means that if the case were heard today, there’s a real likelihood it would be decided differently.</p>\n    <p>\n            While Justice Samuel Alito seemed to want to wall off the abortion rights precedent upended by the Supreme Court earlier this year, CNN’s Ariane de Vogue has written about how the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization could affect issues like marriage. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/politics/roe-alito-obergefell-loving\">Read her story</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>A complete 180 in Congress</h2>\n    <p>\n            Despite the fine print, it is almost unbelievable that less than<strong> </strong>a generation ago, Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president in the ’90s, worked together to protect the “institution of marriage” from same-sex unions.\n    </p>\n    <p>Today, it’s Republicans and Democrats, along with a Democratic president, working together to protect same-sex marriage from a government institution.</p>\n    <p>\n            During that time, public support for same-sex marriage grew from about a quarter of the public in the year the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/393197/same-sex-marriage-support-inches-new-high.aspx\">71% in Gallup polling this year</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>The issue has played a role in multiple US elections, including, arguably, the one that just took place.</p>\n    <p>\n            Here’s a brief history of marriage equality playing a role in prior<strong> </strong>election years:\n    </p>\n    <h2>26 years ago, there was united opposition</h2>\n    <p>In 1996, Republican majorities in the House and Senate sensed a political opening after then-President Bill Clinton failed to allow gay people to openly serve in the military.</p>\n    <p>\n            They were also trying to get ahead of a Hawaii court decision that could have legalized same-sex marriage in that state. Fearing every state might have to recognize same-sex unions, Republicans pushed the Defense of Marriage Act,<strong> </strong>known as DOMA. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            It declared marriage as between one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize marriages. It also<strong> </strong>withheld federal benefits from married same-sex couples. In 2013, a part of DOMA<strong> </strong>was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2013/06/26/politics/scotus-same-sex-doma/index.html\">found to be unconstitutional</a>. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            DOMA had broad approval. Democrats like then-Sen. Biden <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1042/vote_104_2_00280.htm\">voted for the bill</a>. Current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and many other Democrats whose names you’d recognize, were among the 342 who voted for the bill in the House. \n    </p>\n    <p>Current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among the 67 members to vote “no,” along with then-Rep. Steve Gunderson, who at the time was the House’s only out gay Republican.</p>\n    <h2>18 years ago, Republicans used opposing gay marriage to their advantage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2004,<strong> </strong>placing anti-gay-marriage amendments on ballots in key states like Ohio was smart politics. It helped George W. Bush win reelection to the White House and the GOP gain seats in the US Senate. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            Bush <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/02/25/elec04.prez.bush.marriage/index.html\">endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage</a>. The Democratic candidate, John Kerry, also opposed same-sex marriage at the time. \n    </p>\n    <h2>14 years ago, Democrat Barack Obama opposed gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2008,<strong> </strong>even as more in his party began to publicly support marriage equality, Obama continued his opposition. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He has more recently said and written that he always personally supported same-sex marriage<strong> </strong>rights. His campaign aide David Axelrod has written that Obama made a calculated decision to oppose gay marriage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            “He grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a ‘sacred union,’” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/10/politics/obama-gay-marriage-axelrod/index.html\">Axelrod wrote </a>in a memoir.\n    </p>\n    <h2>10 years ago, Obama made the political calculation to support gay marriage</h2>\n    <p>\n            In 2012,<strong> </strong>following the lead of then-Vice President Biden, Obama officially evolved on the issue and said he now supported marriage equality. It was a big<strong> </strong>moment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n            A few years later, in 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling/index.html\">Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide</a>.\n    </p>\n    <h2>5 years ago, Donald Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to publicly support marriage equality</h2>\n    <p>\n            “I’m fine with it,” <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/index.html\">Trump said </a>in 2016 during an interview with “60 Minutes.” \n    </p>\n    <p>\n            He’d go on to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/politics/we-count-new-hampshire/\">brag about </a>being a champion for gay rights, although many LGBTQ activists would disagree.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Now, completing the transformation</h2>\n    <p>The politicians of the ’90s have largely evolved with the country.</p>\n    <p>\n            But this summer,<strong> </strong>one of the Supreme Court’s relics from the ’90s, Justice Clarence Thomas, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/abortion-ruling-gay-rights-contraceptives/index.html\">questioned the 2015 marriage decision</a> he opposed. As a result, Republicans and Democrats have come together again to undo what they did in 1996 and try to guarantee marriage as a right for all Americans.\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/politics/respect-for-marriage-act-what-matters/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
