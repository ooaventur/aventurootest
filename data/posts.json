Can Bitcoin’s price now break its previous  all-time high of $123,000?</strong></p><p>On-chain analysts predict the next two weeks will be crucial for price action, saying a new all-time high is likely if <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">futures</a> premiums remain positive and open interest increases during this period.</p><h2><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">Futures</a> Market Flips to ‘Risk On’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">US federal funds rate by 25 basis points</a> to 4.00–4.25%. The majority of policymakers supported the cut. According to the Fed’s dot plot, an additional 50 basis points will likely be cut by the end of the year.</p><p>The crypto market responded proactively. <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/ko/insights/quicktake/68cafca16e8c203d2e2168b6-Bitcoin-Derivatives-Flash-Bullish-Signal-Ahead-of-Fed-Cut\">XWIN Research Japan</a>, an analyst at the on-chain data platform CryptoQuant, explained that Bitcoin’s future open interest has turned positive for the first time in three days.</p><p>Recent data shows a surge in long positions across major exchanges. Binance leads the way with a positive change of +$166 million, followed by OKX with +$131 million.</p><p>The analyst noted that derivatives sentiment has clearly shifted to favor risk-taking. He explained that when interest rates fall, demand tends to increase for non-yield-bearing assets like Bitcoin.</p><h2>Sustained <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">Futures</a> Premium And Rising OI Are the Key</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1968553138568286561\">Another analyst, Axel Adler Jr.,</a> stressed the importance of the next two weeks. He pointed out that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">BTC futures</a> are trading at a premium to spot prices, with the basis consistently positive. He added that the 7-day basis is exceeding the 30-day basis, creating a bullish market atmosphere.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">Futures</a>-Spot%. Source: CryptoQuant</p><p>Adler Jr. predicts that there is a 70% chance that Bitcoin’s price will see a gradual upward trend or consolidation over the next two weeks. He states that it’s crucial for the price not to fall during this period and for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-futures/\">futures</a> prices to stay above spot prices.</p><p>Additionally, if the open interest volume increases, he believes the probability of a new all-time high will be high. A break above the all-time high (ATH) is increasingly likely if this scenario plays out.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ath-depends-on-these-three-preconditions-after-rate-cut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>The Federal Reserve’s 25 basis point (bp) rate cut, its first of 2025, set the stage for weeks of market debate.</strong></p>\n<p>While the move was widely expected, Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish tone at yesterday’s press conference and the Fed’s sharply divided dot-plot have left investors wondering what will happen next.</p>\n<h2>Powell Signals a Risk Management Pivot</h2>\n<p>Powell <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">framed the rate cut as a risk management decision</a> in his opening remarks, citing mounting cracks in the US labor market.</p>\n<p>Revised payroll figures showing 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, alongside rising long-term unemployment, point to a weaker foundation than headline numbers suggest.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The risks to</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>are tilted to the upside, and employment risks are tilted to the downside,” Powell<a href=\"\">said</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>The Fed chair also noted that policymakers do not feel the need to move quickly on rates, but must act preemptively to prevent a deeper downturn.</p>\n<p>Powell downplayed the inflationary impact of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/\">Trump’s tariffs</a>, arguing that the pass-through has been “slower and smaller” than anticipated.</p>\n<p>However, he acknowledged price pressures could persist into 2026. At the same time, he described the labor market as no longer “solid.”</p>\n<p>He cited hiring slowing, immigration shifts reducing supply, and AI adoption potentially weighing on entry-level jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Powell’s remarks were even more dovish than his 2024 guidance when the Fed slashed rates by 50 bps. This suggests a deliberate pivot toward prioritizing employment over <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Market Reaction With Fed Divisions on Full Display: Dollar Slides, Equities Eye Liquidity</h2>\n<p>The new dot-plot revealed a central bank struggling to find consensus. Nine of 19 officials see two more cuts this year, while six expect no further easing.</p>\n<p>One member even projects a hike, while Trump appointee Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a 50 bps cut.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This meeting was a mess…One member thinks the Fed hikes this year…another thinks we get five cuts. This rigging of the</p><a href=\"\">voting</a>to create the illusion of a ‘consensus’ and then publishing a wide dot plot like this only further undermines their credibility,”<a href=\"\">said</a>macro investment researcher Jim Bianco.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1968439250325836134/photo/1\">Jim Bianco on X</a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, The Kobeissi Letter called the move historic, highlighting the first rate cut in over 30 years with Core PCE <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a> above 2.9%.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s clear the Fed is prioritizing the labor market over</p><a href=\"\">inflation</a>,” Kobeissi<a href=\"\">wrote</a>, noting markets now expect as many as four more cuts by September 2026.</blockquote>\n<p>The immediate market response was swift. The US dollar fell to its weakest level since February 2022, while equities held near record highs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/perpetual-futures-contracts\">Futures markets</a> priced in at least two additional cuts by year-end, with Kalshi data showing the odds of three cuts spiking above 60%.</p>\n<h2>What Did the Markets Interpret from Powell’s Speech Yesterday?</h2>\n<p>Barchart highlighted that when the Fed cuts rates within 2% of stock market all-time highs, the S&amp;P 500 has historically risen 100% of the time over the following 12 months, averaging a 14% gain.</p>\n<p>Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer compared the moment to the late-1998 LTCM crisis, when the Greenspan Fed eased into strong markets, fueling a spectacular rebound.</p>\n<p>Crypto markets are also watching liquidity flows closely, with analyst Ash Crypto highlighting prospects for more liquidity in the face of more rate cuts. This, he says, would translate into potential pumps for crypto prices.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“More cuts = More liquidity = pump,” the analyst</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>.</blockquote>\n<h2>The Case for Caution</h2>\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced the cut heralds an extended bull cycle. Mark Minervini argued the Fed’s move was a “token” cut. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-us-cpi-fed-rate-decision-september/\">Given inflation’s persistence</a>, he says it is unlikely to set off an aggressive easing path.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Rate cuts are typically bullish, particularly when they occur outside of a recession. But the Fed is cutting preemptively rather than reacting to an outright downturn. That distinction matters: it lowers the likelihood of an aggressive easing path, which could diminish the market impact,” he</p><a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, economists at The Conversation stressed the balancing act: cutting too quickly could reignite <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>, while moving too slowly risks a sharper labor downturn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/trump-tariff-appeal-crypto-market-impact/\">Tariff-driven price pressures</a> complicate the picture, particularly for lower-income households, who spend more on imported essentials that are now climbing in cost.</p>\n<p>Henrik Zeberg, a long-time cycle analyst, warned that markets may enter a euphoric blow-off phase before a severe downturn.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Liquidity now will only build a higher peak from which the market can crash,” he</p><a href=\"\">wrote</a>, likening today’s rally to late-1920s behavior.</blockquote>\n<h2>What Comes Next</h2>\n<p>The divergence between strong market technicals and weakening fundamentals leaves investors in a precarious position.</p>\n<p>Investors believe Powell has signaled further cuts are coming. Against this backdrop, sentiment is bullish, at least for now, with equities at records and crypto climbing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">BeInCrypto</a></p>\n<p>As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading for $117,107, while Ethereum exchanged hands for $4,572. Both assets showed strength following the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, risks abound and continue to erode investor confidence. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>A labor market softening into recession,</li><li>Tariff-driven <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>stickiness, and</li><li>Political overtones around Powell’s “risk management” framing.</li></ul>\n<p>If the Fed cuts too aggressively, it risks losing its <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency/\">inflation</a>-fighting credibility. At the same time, rising unemployment could force more drastic action later if it moves too cautiously.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the next few weeks for riskier assets like Bitcoin may be defined by liquidity-driven optimism. However, this is with the understanding that this rally rests on fragile ground.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The head of a leading crypto exchange says the launch of an XRP ETF could bring a wave of fresh capital into the market. He believes the impact will strengthen XRP’s place among digital assets, attract institutional investors, and increase trust in the token. </p>\n    <h2>Crypto.com CEO Predicts $8 Billion Inflows Into XRP ETF</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/thecryptosquire/status/1967898761411301636?s=46\">In a recent video posted</a> on X by John Squire, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek shared his bold outlook for XRP’s future. He predicts that a new XRP ETF could draw as much as $8 billion in inflows in its first year. According to Marszalek, that level of new money would provide XRP with the extra liquidity it needs to gain more ground in the global cryptocurrency market.</p>\n    <p>Marszalek explains that <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-etf-launch-could-see-5-b-inflows-outpacing-ethereum-etfs-ceo/\">these inflows would show</a> a new level of confidence, moving XRP beyond being viewed as just a speculative asset in the digital space. According to the Crypto.com CEO, this moment marks the beginning of XRP’s next phase of growth. </p>\n    <p>Marszalek’s prediction suggests that the ETF would indicate institutions are prepared to view XRP as more than just a trading coin. For the XRP community, Marszalek’s words are <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-analyst-says-to-strap-in/\">adding to the excitement already building.</a>  </p>\n    <h2>ETF To Drive Institutional Demand And Liquidity Growth</h2>\n    <p>As institutions add XRP to their portfolios, retail interest may also rise, broadening the base of buyers. The Crypto.com CEO believes the new inflows will not only <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/what-will-spark-an-xrp-price/\">raise XRP’s position</a> but also give it a larger role in decentralized finance (DeFi). With billions in fresh capital, XRP could appeal more to investors who want blockchain assets for trading or financial tools. </p>\n    <p>The timing of the first XRP spot ETF also adds to the bullish momentum. The <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/rex-shares-claims-its-doge-and-xrp-spot-etfs-will-be-approved-by-us-sec-tomorrow/\">REX Shares and Osprey Funds will launch</a> the XRP ETF on September 18. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirms that the XRP ETF is set to launch this week, despite potential delays for other products. ETF expert Eric Balchunas also notes that, although timelines are shifting, the Osprey XRP ETF is ready to begin trading soon, and experts predict it will attract increased institutional demand.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/if-xrp-etfs-get-approval/\">If that forecast holds</a>, XRP could face a sudden inflow that market watchers call a “liquidity tsunami.” With inflows of up to $8 billion predicted by the Crypto.com CEO, the XRP ETF could mark the beginning of a liquidity surge unlike anything the asset has experienced before.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/top-firm-predicts-no-surge-for-xrp-despite-anticipated-october-spot-etf-approval/\">Expectations are running high</a> among community members and market watchers, who will closely monitor the speed at which funds arrive and how exchanges handle the resulting flows. Traders and long-term holders say they will closely monitor liquidity, adoption, and <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/why-50-xrp-by-december-2025-isnt-hopium-if-etfs-get-greenlight-analyst/\">whether XRP gains steady</a> institutional support moving forward.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"http://TradingView.com\">XRPUSDT on TradingView.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

Given the notable performance of their futures market and interest, crucial tools are currently being created to optimize and capture opportunities in the ecosystem.</p>\n    <h2>CME Unveils Solana And XRP Futures Options</h2>\n    <p>In the ongoing cycle, <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/mike-novogratz-backs-solana/\">Solana</a> and XRP futures are receiving more attention in the derivatives market, indicating that both institutional and retail traders are becoming more interested. These assets are becoming more prominent alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum in futures trading as liquidity increases and open interest grows.</p>\n    <p>Amid the rising adoption, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group), one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges, has expressed its robust interest in the two leading assets. Specifically, the firm is expanding its crypto offerings with the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cme-group-to-launch-options-on-solana-and-xrp-futures-302558956.html\">planned launch</a> of options on Solana and <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-beats-out-heavy-hitters/\">XRP</a> futures.</p>\n    <p>The action indicates that institutional demand for exposure to digital assets besides <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-3-3-billion-comeback/\">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a> is increasing. According to the report, the initiative is still pending regulatory approval and is expected to be unveiled on October 13, 2025.</p>\n    <p>Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products, speaking on the move, stated that the introduction of these options contracts builds on the company’s suite of Solana and <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-futures-cme-record-235-million-traded-one-day/\">XRP futures’ </a>notable expansion and rising liquidity. </p>\n    <p>CME Group’s launch of these new products will give clients the ability to trade options on SOL, Micro SOL, XRP, and Micro XRP futures. Once trading begins, expiries will be made available every day of the business week, every month, and every quarter of the year.</p>\n    <p>It is worth noting that these contracts will be available in two different sizes. By introducing new trading instruments tied to Solana and XRP, the CME Group aims to provide investors with improved flexibility in risk management and <a href=\"https://bitcoinist.com/new-derivatives-product-from-mexc-combines-inclusive-trading-and-earning-opportunities/\">seizing opportunities</a>. The firm will be partnering with FalconX to enhance market efficiency and increase derivatives liquidity for its clients.</p>\n    <h2>Notable Futures Contracts Created On The Platform</h2>\n    <p>While options trading is still in the works, the Solana and XRP <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-6800-year-cme-futures-data-institutional/\">futures suite from CME Group </a>has grown to be among the business’s most rapidly embraced futures offerings. In the report, the firm highlighted that more than 540,000 SOL futures contracts valued at $22.3 billion have traded since it was introduced on March 17. </p>\n    <p>As of August 2025, the average daily volume (ADV) of <a href=\"https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-futures-market-surges/\">SOL futures</a> monthly reached 9,000 contracts, valued at $437.4 million in notional. Meanwhile, the average daily open interest (ADOI) reached 12,500 contracts, valued at $895 million in notional.</p>\n    <p>Such growth has also been observed with its XRP futures, recording more than 370,000 XRP futures contracts worth $16 billion in notional value since launch on May 19. At the same time, the XRP futures saw a record ADOI of 9,300 contracts valued at $942 million in notional value, and a record monthly ADV reached over 6,600 contracts worth $385 million in notional value.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/cXs4YTsV/\">Tradingview.com</a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/safe.png\"/>\n    <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>for bitcoinist is centered on delivering thoroughly researched, accurate, and unbiased content.

This comes as Stephen Miran was confirmed to the Federal Reserve Board by a narrow 48-47 Senate vote on September 16, 2025.</p>\n    <p>Hayes believes the Fed is preparing to implement yield curve control (YCC) as part of what some are calling a “third mandate.” This would be in addition to the Fed’s existing responsibilities of maintaining price stability and maximum employment.</p>\n    <blockquote><p>With Fed board member Miran now confirmed, the MSM is preparing the world for the Fed's \"third mandate\" which is essentially yield curve control. LFG!</p><p>YCC -&gt;</p><a href=\"\">$BTC</a>= $1m<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/jlPQZJ0cHm</a><p>— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes)</p><a href=\"\">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>\n    <p>The crypto market appears to be positioning for a major move. Bitcoin has maintained support above $116,000 while showing 5.1% gains over the past week. The cryptocurrency sits just 5.6% below its all-time high of $124,457 set on August 14.</p>\n    <p>Market watchers have noted several indicators supporting a bullish outlook. Tether recently minted $1 billion in USDT, providing potential liquidity for crypto exchanges. This move suggests preparation for increased market activity.</p>\n    <p>On-chain data reveals changing dynamics <a href=\"https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-btc-casinos/\">in Bitcoin ownership</a>. A newly created wallet accumulated 5,817 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $680 million. This transaction indicates institutional-level interest rather than retail investment.</p>\n    <h2>Understanding Yield Curve Control</h2>\n    <p>Hayes’ prediction centers on the concept of yield curve control, which represents a more aggressive form of monetary policy than traditional rate cuts. While conventional policy focuses on setting overnight lending rates, YCC involves the Federal Reserve setting explicit targets for long-term interest rates.</p>\n    <p>To enforce these targets, the Fed would purchase government bonds in quantities sufficient to maintain rates below specified thresholds. This approach would hold down borrowing costs across the economy regardless of bond market sentiment.</p>\n    <p>The implications could be far-reaching. Such a policy would likely generate substantially more liquidity than previous quantitative easing programs. Risk assets including stocks, Bitcoin, and gold could respond with major price increases.</p>\n    <p>Hayes sees this scenario unfolding due to mounting pressures in the financial system. The combination of high debt levels, dwindling bond buyers, and fiscal challenges may eventually force the Fed’s hand, triggering the implementation of YCC.</p>\n    <p>Some macro analysts describe this as a potential “doom loop.” As inflation persists and government deficits grow, central banks may have no choice but to increase money printing. With fewer parties willing to purchase debt, especially at negative real rates, the Federal Reserve could become the primary buyer of last resort.</p>\n    <p>According to Hayes, this scenario would drive Bitcoin to previously unimaginable price levels as governments dilute currency values and investors seek alternative stores of value.</p>\n    <p>The enormous pool of capital sitting in money market funds could further accelerate this trend. These funds have reached a record $7.5 trillion, representing potential investment capital that could flow into risk assets when interest rates decline.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrq5x97qlqo\">Miran’s confirmation</a> is viewed as particularly relevant by crypto observers because of his previous positive comments about Bitcoin. In a 2023 post, he wrote “Bitcoin fixes this,” suggesting the cryptocurrency could address problems within the traditional financial system.</p>\n    <p>The CME FedWatch tool currently assigns a 96% probability of a 25 basis-point rate cut, indicating market consensus around loosening monetary policy. Combined with U.S. fiscal expansion and growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency, these factors create a macro environment that could support Hayes’ optimistic outlook.</p>\n    <p>While the timeframe for reaching such extraordinary price levels remains unclear, Hayes suggests that pressure will build until a breaking point forces dramatic policy changes. The ongoing accumulation by whale wallets and declining exchange reserves suggest institutional positioning is already underway.</p>\n    <p>As of writing, Bitcoin trades above $117,000, having gained 5.9% over the past two weeks. Market participants are closely watching for signs of Fed policy shifts that could trigger the next major move in cryptocurrency markets.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/arthur-hayes-links-bitcoins-future-to-feds-third-mandate-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><i>Australia takes a step toward stablecoin regulations, allowing licensed issuers’ intermediaries to operate without extra licenses, boosting innovation, clarity, and liquidity.</i></p><p>Australia is moving forward with an important decision in digital finance. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has introduced a new rule that makes it easier for companies to distribute <a href=\"https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-supports-innovation-through-exemptions-for-distributors-of-australian-stablecoin/\">stablecoins</a>. This rule provides some businesses with legal leeway from requiring multiple licenses. It only applies if the stablecoins that they handle are already issued by a licensed financial provider.</p><h2><strong>ASIC Eases Rules for Stablecoin Distributors Under New Framework</strong></h2>\n<p>This is the first time Australia has provided for such a group exemption. It will begin to start once it is officially registered in the country’s federal legislation. This change comes as Australia looks to support responsible innovation in the digital assets sector. At the same time, it wants to safeguard consumers.</p><p><i>Related Reading: </i><i>Australia Approves First Bitcoin-Backed Home Loan After Court Win | Live Bitcoin News</i></p><p>Under this new rule, intermediaries are not required to obtain separate financial services, market or clearing licenses. This is only the case when they distribute stablecoins from a licensed issuer. However, they must still share the official document of product disclosure to the customers, if available. This leaves transparency but eliminates red tape.</p><p>ASIC said it will consider extending such relief as more stablecoin issuers become licensed. For the moment, only stablecoins issued by Australian Financial Services (AFS) license holders qualify. This means that the system is still concerned with who gets to benefit.</p><p>Many experts view this as a huge step. The head of Blockchain APAC Steve Vallas said the rule is a short-term solution. It makes things easier until the government gets to work on larger reforms for stablecoins. He also explained that the relief does not alter the rules regarding which stablecoins are financial products. Instead, it puts on hold some extra requirements for companies who only distribute them.</p><p>Importantly, the responsibility remains with the stablecoin issuers. They have to ensure that all rules and disclosure requirements are fulfilled. The purpose is to make the system safe and fair even as new technologies are tried out and used.</p><h2><strong>Australia’s Stablecoin Framework Offers Clarity and Global Vision</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.asic.gov.au/\">ASIC</a> had already given some hints of changes earlier this year. Some stablecoin issuers would be likely to require licenses, its December report said. That gave many intermediaries a lot of confusion. This new step provides a way forward for them and keeps them within the legal boundaries.</p><p>The move is expected to benefit the market in a number of ways. First, it may help to speed up the process of cross-border payments, which can often be slow and expensive. Second, it could provide more liquidity to crypto traders. Finally, everyday users may acquire access to much better monetary tools that combine traditional money with digital systems.</p><p>Looking into the future, this change is an indication that Australia wishes to be a leader in<a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/australia-orders-binance-to-appoint-auditor-over-crypto-laundering-risks/\"> crypto policy</a> worldwide. Other countries are closely observing as they ponder how to handle digital assets. By providing this exemption, Australia is demonstrating that it wants to balance safety and innovation.</p><p>In conclusion, even if the rule may seem technical, it may have a huge impact. It forms the basis for the rise of stablecoins in Australia’s economy. It also provides businesses with more clarity and flexibility in the work they do with this rapidly changing technology.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/australia-takes-big-step-toward-stablecoin-regulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The search for the best crypto presale to buy is heating up, and many eyes are now on Layer Brett ($LBRETT). This new Ethereum Layer 2 memecoin has already raised about $3.7m in its presale, with <a href=\"http://layerbrett.com\">tokens priced at just $0.0058</a>. </p>\n    <p>Early staking rewards are around 690% APY, making it one of the most talked-about launches of 2025. While older players like SHIB still dominate the market, a smaller project like Layer Brett could deliver bigger gains.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett is built for the future</h2>\n    <p>Layer Brett sets itself apart from traditional meme token projects by focusing on speed, utility, and scalability. It processes transactions off-chain through Ethereum Layer 2, cutting costs down to pennies while still settling securely on Layer 1. This avoids the congestion and high gas fees that slow down older chains.</p>\n    <p>The project’s community-first design also makes it appealing. Early buyers can stake immediately using ETH, USDT, or BNB and lock in those high yields. For many investors, that combination of crypto presale pricing and huge staking rewards makes it the best crypto presale to buy right now.</p>\n    <h2>What is Layer Brett?</h2>\n    <p>At its core, Layer Brett is a next-generation memecoin designed to blend viral culture with real blockchain performance. It features a transparent supply of 10 billion tokens, high staking rewards, and plans for gamified features, NFTs, and governance tools.</p>\n    <p>The team describes it as “meme-born, utility-built,” and that sums it up well. It’s not just a hype coin like many projects that came before; it’s designed to scale.<graphic src=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lbn2-106.jpg\"/></p>\n    <h2>How does Layer Brett work?</h2>\n    <p>$LBRETT uses Ethereum Layer 2 to handle transactions quickly and cheaply. That means users can buy, stake, and trade without worrying about $10–$20 fees during network congestion.</p>\n    <p>The process is simple: connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose ETH, USDT, or BNB, and buy. Tokens can be staked right away for around 690% APY. This efficiency gives <a href=\"http://layerbrett.com\">Layer Brett</a> a real edge over older projects.</p>\n    <h2>What is SHIB?</h2>\n    <p>SHIB, better known as Shiba Inu, is one of the most famous meme coins in the world. Launched as a “DOGE killer,” it gained popularity for its branding and massive community. Over time, SHIB has grown into a larger ecosystem with Shibarium, DeFi tools, and even metaverse ambitions.</p>\n    <p>Despite its popularity, SHIB shows how big market caps can limit growth. While it remains a top coin by volume, it doesn’t have the same explosive upside potential that new crypto presales like $LBRETT can offer.<graphic src=\"https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lbn3-105.jpg\"/></p>\n    <h2>SHIB price prediction</h2>\n    <p>SHIB hit an all-time high of $0.000090 in September 2021. In the last month, it has gained about 20%, while trading volume has jumped 40%. Still, analysts note that because SHIB already has such a large market cap, it’s harder for it to deliver 50x or 100x returns again.</p>\n    <p>That’s why some traders are shifting focus to smaller projects they see as the best crypto presale to buy.</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett price outlook</h2>\n    <p>With presale tokens at $0.0058, about $3.7m already raised, and staking rewards near 690% APY, Layer Brett looks well-positioned for growth. As a low-cap crypto gem, it offers far more upside than established tokens like SHIB.</p>\n    <p>If demand builds during the 2025 bull run, analysts believe $LBRETT could rally sharply from its presale price.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>While SHIB remains one of the most recognizable meme coins, its size makes future gains slower. For investors chasing fresh opportunities, <a href=\"http://layerbrett.com\">Layer Brett</a> brings together meme appeal and Ethereum Layer 2 utility in a way that few projects do. </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>With staking rewards, low fees, and a presale price of just $0.0058, it’s no surprise many are calling it the </strong>\n      <strong>best crypto presale to buy</strong>\n      <strong> in 2025.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Website:</strong>\n      <strong> https://layerbrett.com</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Telegram:</strong>\n      <strong> https://t.me/layerbrett</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>X:</strong>\n      <strong> (1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.

Importantly, the fund incorporates a foreign exchange (FX) risk hedging strategy, aiming to reduce investors’ exposure to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Polish zloty. This makes it the first ETF on GPW to offer cryptocurrency exposure while managing currency volatility.</p>\n    <p>“GPW addresses investors’ expectations and follows the trend of diversifying asset classes available on the public market,” said Michał Kobza, Member of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. “Equally important, offering exposure to bitcoin through an ETF listed on GPW increases safety of trading as investors can participate in the cryptocurrency market using an instrument which is supervised, cleared, and subject to the transparency standards applicable to a regulated capital market.”</p>\n    <p>The ETF prospectus was approved by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) on June 17, 2025. The approval granted AgioFunds TFI permission to issue both Series A and B investment certificates. To ensure liquidity, Dom Maklerski Banku Ochrony Środowiska S.A. has been designated as the market maker.</p>\n    <p>“Less than a month after our most recent new listing, we are introducing another ETF offering exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency in a regulated and effective manner,” stated Kazimierz Szpak, CEO of BETA TFI SA and BETA ETF Asset Manager at AgioFunds TFI SA. “The ETF is our response to the growing demand from investors for new asset classes. I believe that the Bitcoin BETA ETF will meet market expectations and will be welcomed by investors.”</p>\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.gpw.pl/event?cmn_id=117323&amp;title=Bitcoin+BETA+ETF+Newly+Listed+on+GPW\">launch</a> of the Bitcoin BETA ETF brings the total number of ETFs listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange to sixteen. These include funds tracking Polish indices such as WIG20<strong>, </strong>mWIG40, and sWIG80, as well as international benchmarks like the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq-100, and DAX. The exchange also offers sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, and inverse ETFs.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-a-bitcoin-etf\">ETF</a> adoption in Poland has been growing rapidly. According to GPW data, turnover in ETFs has reached PLN 1.9 billion year-to-date, representing a 94.2% increase compared to the same period last year.</p>\n    <p>By listing its first Bitcoin ETF, GPW joins global capital markets that have already embraced Bitcoin-based products. The listing reflects rising demand from institutional and retail investors seeking regulated pathways to access bitcoin as an asset class, while also strengthening Poland’s position in the rapidly evolving ETF landscape.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/warsaw-stock-exchange-debuts-bitcoin-beta-etf-expanding-crypto-market-access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But I do imagine that the $100 to $200 trillion in debt that both Saylor and Armstrong are envisioning is constituted of other currencies, and, in such a scenario, bitcoin has likely been relegated to “<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/michael-saylor-pushes-digital-capital-narrative-at-bitcoin-treasuries-unconference\">digital capital</a>” instead of money — and that’s not my vision for it. (To be fair, it could be used as digital capital and money simultaneously.)</p>\n    <p>My vision is closer to what we see in <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/bitcoin-books/an-excerpt-from-bitcoin-circular-economies-the-impact\">bitcoin circular economies</a>, communities around the world that use bitcoin as money. I’ve visited a number of these communities and witnessed the tremendous impact they’ve had on the lives of their members.</p>\n    <p>Many members of these communities have never had a bank account or been a part of the broader digital financial system, which means they likely aren’t even eligible to apply for credit. However, with bitcoin, they’re able to save and build small businesses with those savings.</p>\n    <p>This is part of the magic of Bitcoin: It empowers those who’ve been neglected by the traditional financial system, while saving those of us who have access to it from becoming debt slaves.</p>\n    <p>We may never live in a completely definancialized future, and that’s fine. It’s one thing to acknowledge that, but it’s another to envision a future of finance built on bitcoin before we’ve even succeeded in having it widely adopted as money, which is what Satoshi intended for it to be.</p>\n    <p>It would be fantastic if some of the most prominent names in the industry supported bringing the original vision for bitcoin to life before proposing that we incorporate it into the antiquated, corrupt system as little more than a new form of collateral.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>This article is a </i>\n      <i>Take</i>\n      <i>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Dogecoin remains one of the most recognizable names in the crypto market, largely due to its enduring meme culture and its unique place in the digital asset narrative. Created as a joke, DOGE has since captured the loyalty of millions and become an integral part of retail-driven trading cycles. Today, analysts are once again paying attention as institutional inflows reshape the market. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already attracting billions, speculation has emerged about whether meme coins like Dogecoin could benefit from the spillover effect. Some analysts are now projecting that DOGE could climb as high as $0.50, provided ETF demand continues to push liquidity into the broader market. Alongside legacy meme coins, newer entrants such as <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/m1th\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> are also gaining traction, presenting alternative high-upside bets for investors seeking fresh opportunities.</p>\n    <h3>Dogecoin’s ETF Momentum</h3>\n    <p>Dogecoin has historically thrived during waves of speculative enthusiasm, but this time the context is different. The approval of multiple crypto ETFs in 2025 has changed the liquidity landscape, channeling institutional money into the ecosystem at unprecedented levels. While these products do not directly hold DOGE, their success is altering how traders allocate capital. Retail investors in particular often mirror institutional confidence, seeking opportunities in meme-driven assets once Bitcoin and Ethereum establish momentum.</p>\n    <p>With DOGE already integrated into several payment experiments and maintaining strong cultural resonance, analysts argue that it is well-positioned to ride this secondary wave. If ETFs continue attracting inflows at current rates, the market could see liquidity spill over into meme coins, accelerating a run toward the $0.50 target being discussed in trading circles.</p>\n    <h3>The Case For $0.50 DOGE</h3>\n    <p>At present, Dogecoin trades well below the levels seen during its 2021 peak, when it briefly touched $0.73. Supporters say this leaves room for substantial upside if momentum returns. The logic is straightforward: if Dogecoin could achieve such highs without institutional tailwinds, the current environment of ETF-driven liquidity provides a stronger foundation for a repeat performance.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, DOGE continues to enjoy unparalleled brand recognition. From Elon Musk’s references on social media to its use in grassroots online communities, Dogecoin’s cultural footprint gives it a staying power that many meme tokens lack. Analysts emphasizing the $0.50 target see it less as a speculative stretch and more as a reversion to the historical highs, catalyzed by the broader wave of ETF enthusiasm lifting the market.</p>\n    <p>While Dogecoin commands legacy status, new tokens are emerging to capture speculative capital with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project, quickly becoming a favorite among retail traders and analysts alike. The project distinguishes itself through its completed HashEx and CertiK audits, giving it a legitimacy that sets it apart from most meme-inspired launches.</p>\n    <p>Dogecoin’s ETF narrative is driving bold predictions of a potential surge to $0.50, reminding investors of its enduring cultural power. Yet analysts caution that DOGE’s size makes massive multiples harder to achieve in the current cycle. That’s why many are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale touted as the next meme-driven breakout with 12,500% ROI forecasts. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-vanishing allocations mirror the explosive setups that once defined DOGE’s earliest days. Community momentum is also building, with Telegram and X chatter framing it as a rare chance to ride the next viral token before mainstream adoption. While DOGE may capture steady ETF-driven flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where traders believe the truly exponential upside remains hidden.</p>\n    <h3>Meme Coin Competition Intensifies</h3>\n    <p>The meme coin sector has always been highly competitive, with each cycle bringing new contenders. In 2021 it was SHIB that surprised markets, while in 2023–2024 tokens like PEPE took their turn in the spotlight. The current landscape suggests that both legacy players like DOGE and SHIB and newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE could thrive simultaneously, catering to different segments of the market.</p>\n    <p>This coexistence matters for investors. While DOGE provides cultural permanence and liquidity depth, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide exponential growth potential. Balancing both offers a diversified approach, capturing the stability of established names while allowing exposure to fresh speculative momentum. Analysts suggest this dual-track strategy may be the most effective way to navigate the meme coin space heading into 2026.</p>\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>Dogecoin’s path to $0.50 hinges on sustained ETF inflows and the willingness of retail traders to follow institutional signals. If the broader market maintains its bullish trajectory, DOGE could revisit its historical highs, cementing its place as the original meme coin. Yet the spotlight is also expanding. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its <a href=\"https://crypto-economy.com/presale-momentum-best-crypto-presale-magacoin-finance-surpasses-14m-and-13500-investors/\">audits</a>, scarcity, and fast-growing community, is rapidly positioning itself as the next major meme-driven breakout. For investors, the lesson may be clear: pairing established names like Dogecoin with speculative presales could be the smartest way to capture the full spectrum of opportunities in this evolving market.</p>\n    <h4>To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:</h4>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/m1th\">https://magacoinfinance.com\n</a>Access: </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://magacoinfinance.com/access\">https://magacoinfinance.com/access<br/>\n</a>Twitter/X:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance<br/>\n</a>Telegram:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

The move eased liquidity conditions, driving investors back into risk-on assets. Institutional demand is surging, with ETF inflows climbing steadily over the past week.</p>\n    <p>Analysts argue that Bitcoin’s rally cements its position as the top hedge against both inflation and monetary policy shifts. With new institutional players entering the market, Bitcoin’s dominance looks set to strengthen further.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2-160-1400x582.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">Source: CoinMarketCap – Bitcoin – Price Chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Ethereum Pushes Toward $4,600 With Strong DeFi and Scaling Adoption</h2>\n    <p>Ethereum (ETH) has climbed to $4,566, supported by growing activity in DeFi and the expansion of Layer-2 scaling solutions. The recent growth in liquid staking protocols and institutional custody services has added fresh momentum. Analysts believe ETH could target $5,000 next, positioning it as the key blockchain for smart contracts and tokenized assets.</p>\n    <p>Developers continue to expand Ethereum’s use cases, reinforcing its role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Meanwhile, presale alternatives such as MAGAX are gaining traction for their unique mix of culture-driven utility and AI safeguards.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/3-130-1400x631.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/\">Source: CoinMarketCap – Ethereum – Price Chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Solana Maintains $240 Support as Ecosystem Activity Expands</h2>\n    <p>Solana (SOL) continues to <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/\">hold firm at the $240 level</a>, showing resilience after months of steady adoption. Its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem and active NFT marketplaces are keeping transaction volumes strong.</p>\n    <p>With developers shipping new apps at scale, SOL is expected to maintain its place as a top-five blockchain by market cap. Market participants note that Solana’s ability to recover from setbacks has boosted investor trust significantly. Yet for those seeking exponential growth, presales like MAGAX may offer a higher-risk but higher-reward path.</p>\n    <h2>XRP Holds Above $3 With ETF Speculation Heating Up</h2>\n    <p>XRP trades steadily above $3 as speculation over a U.S. spot ETF builds. Ripple’s growing push into stablecoin adoption and its expanding roster of banking partners add fuel to the optimism.</p>\n    <p>XRP could reach $5 in early 2026 if ETFs are approved, making it a key breakout token in the regulatory wave. At the same time, community-driven models like <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/\">MAGAX</a> show how cultural adoption can be just as powerful as regulatory milestones.</p>\n    <h2>Altcoins Gain Traction as Presales Outshine Market Performance</h2>\n    <p>While majors dominate headlines, altcoin presales are drawing sharp investor attention. One standout is Moonshot MAGAX, a <a href=\"https://www.moonshotmagax.com/ecosystem\">Meme-to-Earn</a> presale blending cultural virality with blockchain mechanics, already attracting over 80,000 participants.</p>\n    <p>With Stage 2 live at $0.000293 per token, its combination of <a href=\"https://skynet.certik.com/projects/moonshot-magax\">CertiK-audited</a> contracts, AI safeguards, and deflationary design positions it as a high-upside play for 2025. Analysts believe its ability to turn creativity into measurable value makes it one of the most exciting projects of the year. Unlike passive holding, MAGAX enables real engagement and rewards, bridging culture and finance.</p>\n    <h2>Why the Big Players are Rallying, and This New Token is Stealing the Show</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Bitcoin rallies to $117K on FED policy changes and ETF momentum. Investors are eyeing continued inflows as a bullish driver.</li>\n      <li>Ethereum surges toward $4.5K with DeFi and Layer-2 expansion.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Where Ethereum (ETH) boasts over $530 billion market cap and Solana (SOL) commands over $120 billion in value, this coin under $0.004 might dominate Q4 2025. <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi18092\">Little Pepe (LILPEPE)</a>, the Ethereum-based meme coin, has already shown signs of explosive growth, rising 120% from its first presale stage. With more than $25 million raised in its presale, investors are turning their attention to this underdog as Ethereum and Solana begin to cool off. LILPEPE is now positioning itself to dominate Q4 2025 and beyond.</p>\n    <h2>Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Set to Dominate Q4 2025</h2>\n    <p>Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is emerging as the coin under $0.004 that could transform modest investments into substantial gains. The token has already proven demand, with Stage 12 of its presale selling out ahead of schedule, raising over $25.47 million. At present, LILPEPE is valued at $0.0022 during its thirteenth stage. The project aims to raise an additional $3.3 million in this specific phase. The accelerated progression of the presale stages reflects a marked interest from investors seeking early entry, likely in anticipation of a significant price movement in the fourth quarter. Adding to its appeal, the LILPEPE team is actively rewarding its growing community. At present, a substantial giveaway totaling $777,000 is underway. Ten individuals will each be awarded $77,000 in tokens. On top of that, a mega giveaway has been launched for buyers in Stages 12–17, where the top three biggest buyers will win 5, 3, and 2 ETH, respectively.</p>\n    <h2>What Makes Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Unique</h2>\n    <p>Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is not just another meme coin; it is building its identity as the heir to the meme throne. Built on the Ethereum network, it combines decentralization with community-driven energy. The project operates with no taxes, no rug pulls, and a clear focus on transparency, which resonates strongly with meme coin enthusiasts. Unlike other tokens, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) gives a level of fairness and transparency rarely seen in meme coins, and its roadmap signals that the token is destined for greatness, already making waves during its presale. The roadmap playfully describes the token as being in its “pregnancy stage,” symbolizing that the best is yet to come. Behind the humor lies a serious commitment to trust and security. LILPEPE has already been successfully audited by CertiK, achieving a strong security score of 95.49%. This places it among the most secure meme coins in the DeFi space. Presale momentum is just one reason investors are bullish on Little Pepe (LILPEPE). The project has already secured a listing on CoinMarketCap, and the team has confirmed plans to list on two top exchanges immediately after the presale ends. Beyond that, there are ambitions to secure a listing on the largest global exchange, which could dramatically boost trading volume and liquidity as the groundwork for significant growth in Q4 2025.</p>\n    <h2>Could Little Pepe Outperform ETH and SOL?</h2>\n    <p>Projections for late 2025 suggest that Ethereum and Solana may experience more measured growth compared to some emerging tokens in the market. ETH likely remains below the $5,000 benchmark, while SOL may hover in the $200 range. In stark contrast, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which trades at a price well below $0.004, presents itself as an early-stage, high-reward candidate. Should Little Pepe (LILPEPE) follow this established pattern, and with upcoming exchange listings on the horizon for Q4 2025, there exists the possibility of a notable breakout, especially for those who enter the market at this nascent phase.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>As Ethereum and Solana prepare for slower growth phases, <a href=\"http://littlepepe.com/\">Little Pepe (LILPEPE)</a> is emerging as the coin under $0.004 that might dominate Q4 2025. With over $25 million already raised, strong CertiK audit credentials, and a roadmap backed by major exchange listings, LILPEPE has all the ingredients to capture market attention.</p>\n    <h5>For more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:</h5>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi18092\"> https://littlepepe.com</a></p>\n    <p>Whitepaper: <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\">https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/littlepepetoken\">https://t.me/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p>Twitter/X: <a href=\"https://x.com/littlepepetoken\">https://x.com/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The cryptocurrency market is once again gaining momentum as investors search for the right balance between stability, innovation, and explosive upside. In 2025, the landscape looks very different from a few years ago. Established giants like Ethereum and XRP continue to anchor the market with proven adoption and institutional confidence, while infrastructure players like Polkadot and Chainlink are carving out crucial roles in the next generation of blockchain applications. At the same time, early-stage presales such as <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=5+Top+Cryptos+to+Buy+Today%3A+BlockchainFX%2C+Polkadot%2C+Chainlink%2C+Ethereum%2C+and+XRP+are+Ready+to+Explode&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BlockchainFX </a>are offering rare entry points with built-in upside and tangible real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>For those asking which projects stand out right now, we’ve broken down 5 top cryptos to buy today — each representing a different angle on where the market is headed.</p>\n    <h2>1. BlockchainFX (BFX): The Presale Turning heads</h2>\n    <p>BlockchainFX is rapidly positioning itself as one of the most compelling presales of 2025. The project has already raised over $7.5M from more than 9,600 investors. At a presale price of $0.024 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, early buyers secure a 117% upside before public trading even begins.</p>\n    <p>What sets BFX apart is its focus on utility. It is developing a multi-asset super app that allows trading of over 500 assets, including crypto, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and forex. Its deflationary tokenomics redistribute 70% of fees to the community through staking rewards and daily buybacks, while tools like the BlockchainFX Visa card, Apple Pay and Google Pay integration, and an AI-powered trading suite add real-world usability. With staking yields of 90% APY and the <a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=5+Top+Cryptos+to+Buy+Today%3A+BlockchainFX%2C+Polkadot%2C+Chainlink%2C+Ethereum%2C+and+XRP+are+Ready+to+Explode&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\">BLOCK30 promo code</a> unlocking 30% extra tokens, BlockchainFX delivers both immediate income potential and long-term growth.</p>\n    <h2>2. Polkadot (DOT)</h2>\n    <p>Polkadot continues to attract attention for its unique parachain architecture, which allows multiple blockchains to operate and communicate in parallel. This design makes it a backbone for Web3 applications, and developer activity on the network has remained strong despite market fluctuations. DOT’s staking system also incentivizes long-term holding while securing the network.</p>\n    <p>Currently consolidating in the $6–$7 range, Polkadot has room to grow as adoption expands. Analysts see it as a strong play for interoperability and decentralized infrastructure. For investors looking to position themselves in the future of multi-chain ecosystems, Polkadot is one of the top cryptos to buy today.</p>\n    <h2>3. Chainlink (LINK)</h2>\n    <p>Chainlink has established itself as the leading oracle solution, connecting smart contracts with real-world data. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is gaining traction among DeFi platforms and enterprises, cementing Chainlink as a crucial part of blockchain infrastructure.</p>\n    <p>LINK has held firm in the $15–$18 range, with upside potential as adoption grows. The token’s role in securing data feeds and enabling cross-chain communication ensures lasting demand. As more institutions embrace blockchain, Chainlink remains one of the top cryptos to buy today for both utility and growth.</p>\n    <h2>4. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>\n    <p>Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi. Its shift to proof-of-stake has significantly reduced energy consumption and paved the way for further scaling solutions such as sharding and rollups.</p>\n    <p>ETH is trading around $2,500–$2,600, with bullish sentiment building into 2025. Institutional adoption is expanding through ETFs and corporate holdings, making Ethereum a strong candidate for long-term portfolios. For stability and ecosystem dominance, Ethereum stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy today.</p>\n    <h2>5. XRP</h2>\n    <p>XRP has regained momentum after its legal battle with the SEC, reinforcing its role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments. Partnerships with financial institutions worldwide underline its practical utility, positioning XRP as one of the few cryptocurrencies with significant real-world adoption.</p>\n    <p>Trading around $0.50–$0.55, XRP has shown resilience and the potential for strong breakouts if adoption expands further. With regulatory clarity improving and demand for efficient payments growing, XRP remains one of the top cryptos to buy today.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>BlockchainFX offers early-stage growth with built-in upside and practical tools, while Polkadot and Chainlink strengthen the infrastructure narrative. Ethereum provides unmatched stability and scale, and XRP delivers adoption in payments. Together, these five projects highlight the balance between innovation and proven value — and why they stand out as the top cryptos to buy today.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Buy BFX tokens today to get 30% more tokens using the bonus code –  BLOCK30.</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://blockchainfx.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=5+Top+Cryptos+to+Buy+Today%3A+BlockchainFX%2C+Polkadot%2C+Chainlink%2C+Ethereum%2C+and+XRP+are+Ready+to+Explode&amp;utm_campaign=Blockonomi&amp;utm_id=Blockonomi\"> https://blockchainfx.com/ </a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom\">https://x.com/BlockchainFXcom</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram Chat: <a href=\"https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat\">https://t.me/blockchainfx_chat</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Crypto trades often offer big rewards from small stakes. Meme coins linked to bigger blockchain platforms are driving hype and pushing prices higher. Right now, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Floki (FLOKI), and Cardano (ADA) are the tokens people are eyeing. Each of these coins has its own story, but one of them is already making waves and may be the best bet for growth ahead.</p>\n    <h2>1. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Meme-Powered Layer 2 Revolution</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi18091\">Little Pepe</a> isn’t just creating any meme coin; the project aims to develop an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain with low fees. The blockchain will focus on speed and security. At the center of the network is the $LILPEPE token that is also meme-oriented. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0021, with the next stage set at $0.0022. Demand has been overwhelming, with 15.6 billion tokens sold (99.14%) and over $25.19 million raised, putting the project within striking distance of its $25.47 million target. The real confidence boost is security: Little Pepe passed <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/certik-audit/\">CertiK audit</a> with a 95.49% audit score. This proves its smart contracts are solid, free from major flaws, and meet ERC-20 standards. Such assurance is rare in the meme-coin space, where risks run high.</p>\n    <p>The project’s tokenomics are designed to support longevity and trust:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">26.5% Presale – rewarding early adopters</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">30% Chain Reserves – ensuring network strength</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">13.5% Staking &amp; Rewards – for loyal holders</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">10% Liquidity + 10% DEX Allocation – enabling smooth trading and listings</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">10% Marketing – fueling viral campaigns and influencer partnerships</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">0% Tax – ensuring frictionless trading</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>To amplify its community spirit, Little Pepe is also running a <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/777k-giveaway/\">$777,000</a> giveaway, with 10 winners each receiving $77,000 worth of LILPEPE. With a powerful combination of meme culture, audited security, and Layer-2 infrastructure, LILPEPE is arguably the best-positioned project to multiply early investments. It could very well be the one that does more than the rest.</p>\n    <h2>2. Floki (FLOKI) – Breakout From a Wedge Pattern</h2>\n    <p>Floki (FLOKI) investors are excited as the coin broke above the tail end of the falling wedge pattern. Folk analysts see FLOKI reaching prices as high as $0.000120–$0.000125. Currently, FLOKI is trading at $0.00009677, boasting a liquidity-abundant market cap of $934M, along with $101M of daily trading volume and a circulating supply of 9.66T. Support lies near $0.000107–$0.000110. However, the support levels suggest that retail flocks and wholesale traders are buying into FLOKI.</p>\n    <h2>3. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Poised for a “God Candle”</h2>\n    <p>As of September 10, 2025, SHIB is priced at $0.000013 after scouting support at $0.00001180. A breakout above $0.000013 on strong volume could ignite a “God candle.” Momentum indicators, such as the RSI and Stochastic RSI, show a bullish divergence, indicating increased buying pressure. With strong interest from the SHIB Community and brand strength, ShIB has better liquidity than newer meme coins, such as LILPEPE, and is strongly backed with potential for explosive upside.</p>\n    <h2>4. Cardano (ADA) – Quietly Building Strength Toward $1.0</h2>\n    <p>Unlike meme-driven plays, Cardano (rong, quite appealing project. It is priced at $0.87, approaching $0.90, unlike meme-driven plays, with Fibonacci retracements indicating $0.92 as the next target. A breakout here could unlock $1.00 and fuel a 30% rally. Parabolic SAR is bullish for the first time in weeks, indicating a breakout from a falling wedge. Analysts view this as momentum. Scale’s expanding DeFi projects, along with Cardano’s ongoing, research-driven upgrades, offer conservative investors a solid and validated choice.</p>\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>Based on technical accumulation patterns and community narratives, the four tokens to watch closely are:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n<a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/#allowcation\">Little Pepe</a>(LILPEPE) is a meme–powered Layer-2 with a CertiK audit and explosive presale demand.</li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">Floki (FLOKI) – A wedge breakout suggests a 20–30% near-term upside.</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Defending support, eyeing a potential “God candle” breakout.</p></li>\n      <li>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cardano (ADA) – Approaching $0.90; signs suggest a push to $1.00 and beyond.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Among the promising tokens to watch, Little Pepe stands out. It combines viral meme charm, third-party audited security, and fast Layer-2 technology, offering a chance to turn $400 into over $20,000. Investors who want a game-changing opportunity should take note today.</p>\n    <h4>For more information about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) visit the links below:</h4>\n    <p>Website:<a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_medium=Blockonomi18091\"> https://littlepepe.com</a></p>\n    <p>Whitepaper: <a href=\"https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf\">https://littlepepe.com/whitepaper.pdf</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/littlepepetoken\">https://t.me/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p>Twitter/X: <a href=\"https://x.com/littlepepetoken\">https://x.com/littlepepetoken</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p>As 2025 unfolds, the crypto market pulses with energy from both established giants and new contenders. Traders and analysts alike are searching for the best crypto presales to invest in 2025, and the conversation increasingly gravitates toward three names: <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=AVAX%20Records%20$907M%20in%20Daily%20Volume%20and%20HBAR%20$322M,%20as%20BullZilla%20Crosses%20$500K%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Best%20Crypto%20Presale%20to%20Invest%20in%202025\">BullZilla ($BZIL),</a> Avalanche (AVAX), and Hedera (HBAR).</p>\n<p>BullZilla has captured attention as a viral meme coin 2025 project that blends humor with structured tokenomics. Avalanche pushes boundaries with high-speed transactions and interoperability. Hedera offers enterprise-grade blockchain solutions backed by a unique governance council. Together, these projects illustrate why the evolving landscape of digital assets provides some of the most compelling opportunities for both retail enthusiasts and institutional players.</p>\n<h2>BullZilla: The Meme Coin Presale Redefining ROI</h2>\n<p>BullZilla’s rise has been meteoric. Positioned as one of the best crypto presales to invest in 2025, the $BZIL meme coin presale has transformed from a playful experiment into a data-backed ROI opportunity.</p>\n<h3>BullZilla Presale Snapshot</h3>\n<p>This data is extraordinary. A project promising a near 8,000% return from presale to listing naturally commands attention in every meme coin investment guide. Investors often compare <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=AVAX%20Records%20$907M%20in%20Daily%20Volume%20and%20HBAR%20$322M,%20as%20BullZilla%20Crosses%20$500K%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Best%20Crypto%20Presale%20to%20Invest%20in%202025\">Bull Zilla </a>vs Avalanche or BullZilla vs Chainlink, but its structured presale model sets it apart. With presale cryptos with high growth expectations, BullZilla consistently emerges in lists of top altcoins presale 2025.</p>\n<p>The project also sits at the center of new altcoin trends September 2025, where meme-driven communities seek both entertainment and long-term utility. By ensuring transparency in token allocation and offering a presale with defined growth stages, BullZilla provides clarity rarely seen in viral meme coin 2025 launches.</p>\n<h2>Avalanche: The Layer-1 Challenger Scaling Global Adoption</h2>\n<p>Avalanche has positioned itself as one of the most efficient and developer-friendly blockchains. At a live price of $30.03 and a daily trading volume of $907,053,018, it demonstrates robust liquidity and market trust.</p>\n<p>The network’s consensus mechanism is built for speed and security. Capable of handling 4,500 transactions per second with sub-second finality, Avalanche appeals to developers building DeFi platforms, tokenized assets, and cross-chain applications. In the conversation about the best crypto presales to invest in 2025, Avalanche often surfaces in comparative analyses like BullZilla vs Avalanche, where its institutional use cases balance BullZilla’s meme-driven narrative.</p>\n<p>What makes Avalanche particularly intriguing in 2025 is its push toward real-world asset tokenization. Analysts point to studies showing that tokenized markets could exceed $16 trillion by 2030, positioning Avalanche to secure partnerships in the financial and enterprise sectors. Its adaptability in decentralized finance, paired with increasing developer adoption, secures Avalanche’s reputation as one of the most important presale cryptos with high growth potential.</p>\n<h2>Hedera: The Enterprise Blockchain Driving Institutional Trust</h2>\n<p>Hedera is unlike most blockchain projects. At $0.2379 with a 24-hour trading volume of $322,183,490.48, Hedera maintains a unique appeal grounded in corporate trust and governance.

This positions it not just as a crypto asset but as an enterprise infrastructure solution. For financial analysts evaluating the best crypto presales to invest in 2025, Hedera represents a critical divergence: while meme coins like BullZilla thrive on community energy, Hedera thrives on institutional stability.</p>\n<p>Hedera’s expanding role in supply chain transparency, healthcare data management, and micropayments highlights its strategic relevance. In debates such as BullZilla vs Sui or BullZilla vs Chainlink, Hedera stands apart by focusing less on hype and more on structural innovation. Yet, in this diversified market, even Hedera finds itself aligned with new altcoin trends September 2025, particularly among investors seeking exposure to enterprise-grade infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: Find the Best Crypto Presales to Invest in 2025</h2>\n<p>Contrasts define the crypto market in 2025. <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=AVAX%20Records%20$907M%20in%20Daily%20Volume%20and%20HBAR%20$322M,%20as%20BullZilla%20Crosses%20$500K%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Best%20Crypto%20Presale%20to%20Invest%20in%202025\">BullZilla </a>leverages viral energy to offer one of the most ambitious presales in years, with ROI projections that place it at the top of every meme coin investment guide.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>The cryptocurrency market continues to reward transparency, adoption, and verifiable growth. While popular crypto coins like Hedera (HBAR) have captured attention with bullish surge narratives and Sui (SUI) news update highlights, both face volatility and reliance on speculative trends. HBAR’s gains have met resistance around $0.235–$0.299, signaling potential consolidation, while SUI’s DeFi expansion to a $2 billion TVL offers upside but remains sensitive to market fluctuations.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\">BlockDAG (BDAG)</a> enters the scene with a markedly different approach: over $407M raised, 26.3 billion coins sold, 3 million active X1 Mobile Miner users, 19,900 ASIC miners being deployed, and 312,000 verified holders. Its strategy emphasizes transparency as a growth engine, letting clear metrics speak louder than hype. </p><p>For investors analyzing popular crypto coins, BDAG’s combination of adoption, ecosystem strength, and measurable presale performance positions it as the most credible and high-potential option among its peers.</p><h3><strong>Hedera (HBAR) Price Outlook: Is the Bullish Surge Sustainable?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Hedera (HBAR) has recently experienced a notable surge in its price, reaching a high of $0.299 in mid-July. However, the momentum has slowed, and technical indicators suggest a potential bearish pattern forming. The price has declined under a descending resistance trend line since July 27, and after three rejections at the $0.235 level, HBAR broke down, falling to a low of $0.210. Despite this, the breakdown was relatively mild, considering the duration of consolidation below the resistance.</p><p>Analysts are closely monitoring the $0.21–$0.22 support range; a failure to hold this level could lead to further declines. Conversely, a rebound and sustained trading above $0.22 could signal a potential reversal, with the next resistance levels at $0.26.35 and $0.299.</p><p>While HBAR has demonstrated impressive gains in the past, current technical indicators suggest a period of consolidation or potential decline. Investors should remain vigilant and consider the evolving market conditions before making investment decisions.</p><h3><strong>Sui (SUI) Eyes 22% Upside as DeFi TVL Surpasses $2 Billion</strong></h3>\n<p>Sui (SUI) is attracting attention as its decentralized finance ecosystem crosses a Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone of $2 billion, signaling growing adoption. Currently trading near $3.66, SUI has maintained support above key levels, showing resilience despite broader market fluctuations.</p><p>Analysts are observing a descending trendline resistance around $4.43, suggesting that a sustained move above this point could trigger a potential rally toward $5.00, representing roughly 22% upside from current prices. Futures and open interest trends indicate increased trader participation, reflecting confidence in SUI’s short-term momentum.</p><p><graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image3-2.jpg\" alt=\"BlockDAG\"/></p><p>However, market participants are advised to remain cautious, as a failure to hold support levels near $3.50 could lead to retracement. For investors seeking crypto opportunities with measurable on-chain growth, monitoring Sui’s DeFi adoption, liquidity trends, and technical indicators can provide a clear picture of potential upside and risk management strategies.</p><h3><strong>BlockDAG Lays Its Cards on the Table: $407M+ Raised, 3M Miners, 26.3B Coins Sold  </strong></h3>\n<p>BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention in the crypto market with a rare level of transparency. Unlike typical presales that rely on vague projections, BDAG openly shares key metrics: over $407 million raised, more than 26.3 billion coins sold, 19,900 ASIC miners in the process of being delivered, 3 million active X1 Mobile Miner users, and 312,000 holders building a robust community. This data-first approach signals credibility, letting the numbers speak for themselves.</p><p>Currently priced at a special $0.0013; ends in 24 hours, BDAG presents a compelling entry point before public exchange listings. Analysts suggest that if the presale reaches even half of its $600 million target, BDAG’s market cap could rival early Solana, setting the stage for potential rapid adoption and significant upside.</p><p>Technical observers note rising demand and engagement across the ecosystem. Miner sales, holder activity, and ecosystem adoption indicate a strong foundation, reducing the usual speculative uncertainty.</p><p>Unlike projects that rely solely on hype, BlockDAG’s strategy demonstrates that open, verifiable metrics can drive investor confidence and momentum. Buyers scanning for transparent and high-growth crypto opportunities, BDAG stands out as a measurable, data-backed contender, where adoption, liquidity, and ecosystem activity combine to suggest a potentially transformative trajectory in the months ahead.</p><h3><strong>Transparency Turns Metrics Into Market Momentum</strong></h3>\n<p>As the market digests Hedera (HBAR) bullish surge dynamics and monitors Sui (SUI) news update developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with quantifiable, transparent growth. Unlike popular crypto coins that rely on projected hype, BDAG openly shares presale numbers, miner deliveries, and user adoption metrics, giving investors a data-backed lens to assess opportunity.</p><p>Technical indicators and ecosystem engagement reflect a solid foundation, with over $407M raised, 26.3 billion coins sold, and a growing 3M-user X1 Miner network supporting adoption momentum. The combination of verifiable traction and strategic deployment suggests BDAG may outperform many rivals once exchange listings begin, offering potential valuation upside that rivals early Solana.</p><p>For buyers weighing <a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\">popular crypto coins</a> in 2025, BDAG emerges as the standout choice, pairing transparency with demonstrable market confidence, an approach that could reshape expectations for presale-driven growth.</p><p>Presale:<a href=\"https://purchase.blockdag.network/\"> https://purchase.blockdag.network</a></p><p>Website:<a href=\"https://blockdag.network/\"> https://blockdag.network</a></p><p>Telegram:<a href=\"https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\"> https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial</a></p><p>Discord:<a href=\"https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu\"> https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu</a></p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Cardano has been climbing again, with analysts setting their sights on $1.86 ADA. Alongside this, <a href=\"https://magacoinfinance.com\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> is gaining attention as another altcoin to consider, especially as traders rotate capital in search of the best altcoin to buy this quarter.</p>\n    <h2>ADA Cycle Repeats with 260% Rally Setup</h2>\n    <p>Market watchers <a href=\"https://x.com/Bitcoinsensus/status/1965895364327715224\">highlight</a> a recurring pattern in Cardano’s history that once fueled a 260% rally. The pattern involves three key stages: a price rally, sideways movement with a bottom, and then a renewed uptrend. This cycle has played out before, and analysts now believe ADA could be repeating it.</p>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blockonomi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/s3-8.png\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>In 2023, Cardano surged from $0.22 to $0.81, later correcting to $0.27 before climbing again to $1.33 in December 2024. This history has traders optimistic that ADA’s new rally, which started after bottoming at $0.51 in June, could stretch toward $1.86. At today’s price near $0.88, that would be more than 100% growth.</p>\n    <p>Data also shows whales are back in accumulation mode. Wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA scooped up 130 million tokens in just a few days.</p>\n    <p>Large holders now control 18.79 billion ADA, a rise from 18.63 billion at the start of September. This renewed confidence from bigger players is fueling belief that ADA could still climb higher.</p>\n    <h2>Cardano Open Interest and Price Prediction</h2>\n    <p>Along with whale activity, open interest in Cardano futures has risen by $250 million in under a week, reaching $1.80 billion. This comes after a cooling period where OI fell from an all-time high of $1.87 billion. Renewed futures activity suggests traders are positioning for bigger moves ahead.</p>\n    <p>Analysts such as Crypto Patel see this as part of a wider trend, with altcoins lining up for another rotation. Patel even suggested ADA could target $7 in the longer term.</p>\n    <p>Other voices in the community remain bullish, with predictions ranging from ADA reclaiming $4 to more ambitious forecasts of $10 by year’s end.</p>\n    <h2>Another Altcoin to Watch: MAGACOIN FINANCE</h2>\n    <p>Cardano isn’t the only project drawing interest. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been highlighted as the best altcoin to buy alongside ADA. With capital rotating from Bitcoin and Ethereum into smaller names, newer projects can sometimes surge faster. MAGACOIN is still at an early stage, which makes it agile compared to larger, slower-moving coins.</p>\n    <p>Analysts say altcoin diversification is key, and MAGACOIN could even deliver bigger gains before ADA. Its legitimacy and early entry appeal make it a project worth watching as traders explore options beyond the major caps.</p>\n    <h2>Final Thoughts: Positioning Ahead of Altseason</h2>\n    <p>Traders looking at Q4 may want to position early in both ADA and newer projects like MAGACOIN. With Cardano eyeing $1.86 and whales fueling activity, and MAGACOIN offering a fresh path for diversification, now may be the right time to prepare.</p>\n    <h4>Visit the official MAGACOIN FINANCE channels to learn more:</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Website: <a href=\"https://magacoinfinance.com\">https://magacoinfinance.com</a></li>\n      <li>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance</a></li>\n      <li>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

The move followed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments in August at Jackson Hole, where he suggested the central bank was ready to adjust policy.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin climbed to $117,200 earlier in the day but lost nearly $2,000 within hours of the announcement. By evening, it recovered to trade near $118,000. Ether stayed close to $4,600. Analysts said markets had largely priced in the change, leaving traders focused on other developments.</p>\n<p>Attention has shifted to coin presales, where several upcoming crypto projects are attracting capital. Nexchain, Bitcoin Hyper, TOKEN6900, and Snorter Token are among the <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">best alt coins</a> entering 2025, offering investors early exposure to new ecosystems.</p>\n<h2>Nexchain Builds Scalable Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Nexchain has emerged as an <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">upcoming new crypto coin</a> designed for scale. It combines a hybrid Proof-of-Stake system with sharding and Directed Acyclic Graph technology. This setup allows the network to process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, while transaction fees remain fixed at $0.001.</p>\n<p>Smart contracts are built to adapt during heavy traffic, helping the system maintain performance when demand rises. Security features include post-quantum cryptography and fraud detection. A public testnet went live in August, and the September roadmap introduced Nexpolia, which includes new governance tools, developer infrastructure, and a community airdrop.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re entering a key stage – the launch of Nexpolia.</p><p>This quarter brings critical steps that set the foundation for Nexchain’s next phase:</p><br/>• Launch of the initial Testnet environment for Nexpolia<br/>• Airdrop campaign to engage the early community<br/>• Release of Whitepaper v2.0<br/>•…<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/jGmnOjkkBm</a><p>— Nexchain (@nexchain_ai)</p><a href=\"\">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<p/>\n    <p>The NEX token is central to Nexchain’s ecosystem. Holders can use it for staking rewards, governance, payments, and platform services. One feature stands out: 10% of collected gas fees are distributed daily to private wallets holding NEX. This approach rewards loyalty and adds ongoing value for participants.</p>\n<p>By supporting multiple functions, the token creates incentives for both everyday use and long-term network engagement. Governance rights also allow holders to take part in shaping protocol upgrades and community decisions.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Hyper Targets Scalability</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 project designed to improve Bitcoin’s speed and efficiency. It brings lower transaction costs, faster settlement, and stronger support for decentralized applications. Developers will have SDK and API tools, while the Solana Virtual Machine ensures near-instant smart contract execution.</p>\n<p>The system locks BTC on Layer 1 and issues wrapped BTC on Hyper L2, enabling quicker transfers while keeping Bitcoin’s security intact.</p>\n<p>The $HYPER token is available through its presale site. Holders gain access to staking rewards and ecosystem rights. The total supply is 21 billion tokens, distributed across development, rewards, treasury, and marketing. Payments can be made using ETH, USDT, BNB, or card. For those considering <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">upcoming crypto</a> for long term potential, Bitcoin Hyper extends the reach of Bitcoin itself.</p>\n<h2>TOKEN6900 Builds Momentum</h2>\n<p>TOKEN6900 takes a different path. It does not promise direct utility but has built a following around its community. The presale began at $0.006400 and increases gradually to $0.007125. Early buyers may benefit from price gains and staking rewards.</p>\n<p>More than four million tokens are already staked, with estimated rewards surpassing 1,000%. Airdrops and token burns are also planned, with 5% of the supply allocated to community incentives. Purchases can be made with ETH, USDT, or card payments via Best Wallet. For investors searching for <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">upcoming crypto for 10x gains</a>, TOKEN6900 offers high risk and potential high return.</p>\n<h2>Snorter Token Blends Meme Appeal With Trading</h2>\n<p>Snorter Token combines meme culture with practical tools. Built on Solana, it introduces a Telegram-based trading bot that also supports Ethereum and BNB. The bot provides copy trading, rug-pull detection, automated sniping, and MEV-resistant relayers.</p>\n<p>The $SNORT token is issued on both Solana and Ethereum. Its presale is available on the project’s site and in Best Wallet, with purchases possible in crypto or fiat. Staking rewards are offered to early buyers. By linking a trading bot with meme branding, Snorter appeals to traders seeking speed and accessibility.</p>\n<h2>Nexchain Presale Growth</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">Nexchain’s coin presale</a> has reached Stage 27. Tokens are priced at $0.108, with a confirmed listing set at $0.30. This suggests a potential return of 278% for current buyers. More than $10.3 million has already been raised, with the stage capped at $11 million.</p>\n<p>Token distribution favors public buyers, while allocations are also set aside for liquidity, development, marketing, and staking rewards. Team tokens are subject to vesting schedules to avoid sudden selling. Nexchain has also launched a $5 million airdrop. Participants can connect wallets, complete weekly quests, and receive NEX without KYC requirements. Polls among early adopters placed MetaMask as the preferred wallet, ahead of Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet.</p>\n<p>Visit the official <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">Nexchain Presale</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>Presales Take Center Stage in 2025</h2>\n<p>With Bitcoin trading near $118,000, investors are focusing on presales that offer new growth opportunities. Nexchain leads with scalable infrastructure, token rewards, and strong fundraising. Bitcoin Hyper delivers speed to Bitcoin, TOKEN6900 builds through community staking, and Snorter Token mixes meme culture with trading functions.</p>\n<p>These projects reflect the variety of upcoming crypto to buy now. From infrastructure platforms to meme-driven plays, 2025 presales give investors options across risk levels. For those evaluating the <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">best alt coin to buy now</a>, these launches show the momentum of early-stage projects entering the market.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://nexchain.ai/\">nexchain.ai/</a></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/coin-presale-2025-best-new-crypto-presales-offering-high-roi-potential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

From a monthly high of 0.0000146, the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/business/memecoins-gambling-dna-trojan-horse-crypto-adoption/\" auto-attrs>memecoin</a> had crashed 12% to 0.0000130 by Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The fallout from the hack was even worse for BONE, which declined more than 43% in the same period.</p>\n<h2>Shibarium Devs Under Fire</h2>\n<p>In an announcement on Friday, Dhairyain sought to reassure Shibarium users.</p>\n<p>The project’s team had successfully frozen the 4.6 million BONE, he said, preventing any further attacks on the network or its bridge. As a precautionary measure, the team temporarily moved stake manager funds into a hardware wallet and suspended staking and unstaking.</p>\n<p>Post-hack, the SHIB Army has been critical of the project’s leadership.</p>\n<p>Tagging Shytoshi and Dhairyain, one X user <a href=\"https://x.com/Kripto_Fatihi_/status/1966971009770094876\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>pointed<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> out that L2Beat highlighted Shibarium security concerns months ago. “Despite so much time passing, why haven’t the network deficiencies been fixed?” they asked.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, initial silence from Shibarium’s lead developer, Shytoshi, was met with criticism from the community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Why has @ShytoshiKusama been so quiet lately?” one user <a href=\"https://x.com/Yasei__Okami/status/1967486204099658239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>lamented<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>.</p>\n<p>“How can someone claim to be a leader if they’re vocal only during good times but absent when accountability is needed?” They added.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Shytoshi Kusama Responds</h2>\n<p>Responding to community outrage in a <a href=\"https://x.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1967672793526620471\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>post<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> on Monday, Shytoshi said that “to suggest that I am anywhere except beside [other Shibarium developers] figuring out next steps is utterly preposterous.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Yes, we are on it, in the war room, so to speak,” he stressed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although he insisted the recent bridge attack has his full attention, Shytoshi acknowledged that he have been busy with other projects.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2025, the lead Shibarium developer has taken a step back from the L2, turning his attention to other projects and hinting at upcoming AI initiatives.</p>\n<p>For instance, updates to his X bio reference an upcoming whitepaper tying AI, SHIB, $SHY, and DAO roles. In an episode of his podcast in April, he discussed AI’s role in building “the operating system of the future.”</p>\n<p>Confirming his change of priorities, Shytoshi’s post on Monday said: “my focus now lies outside Shib as I push for AI initiatives to better all our tokens.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"ccn-you-may-like\" data-ui-impression data-tracking='{\"item_type\": \"internal-linking\"}'>\n    <p class=\"section-title\">Recommended Secure Partners</p>\n    \n</div>\n\n<p class=\"ccn-vote blocks t-space _vote\">\n\t<span class=\"_text\">\n\t\tWas this Article helpful?\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"yes\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-positive\"></i>\n\t\t<em>Yes</em>\n\t</span>\n\t<span class=\"_button no-select\" data-vote=\"no\">\n\t\t<i class=\"ccn-icon-face-negative\"></i>\n\t\t<em>No</em>\n\t</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"_clear\"></span>                    </div>\n                </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/shiba-inu-shibarium-lead-dev-focus-on-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Liquidity across Ethereum and Linea, combined with MetaMask’s wallet-native integration, supports stability in everyday use. </span></p>\n<p><span>Arbitrage and redemption mechanisms help correct price drift, while reserve yield adds an extra buffer. However, risks remain if liquidity is shallow, audits lapse, or regulatory shifts impact operations, making transparency and adoption key to maintaining trust.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Key Features of mUSD</span></h3>\n<p><b>Native to MetaMask</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Seamless integration for swaps, transfers, bridging, and spending.</span></li>\n<li><span>Lower fees and faster transactions inside the MetaMask ecosystem.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Utility Across DeFi</b></p>\n<p><b>Real-World Spending</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Expected integration with the MetaMask Card for payments at Mastercard merchants worldwide.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Transparency &amp; Compliance</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Reserves are managed by Bridge under strict regulation.</span></li>\n<li><span>Regular audits planned to prevent trust issues like those seen with Tether.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>How to Buy, Sell, Swap, and Bridge MetaMask USD (mUSD)</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask makes it simple to manage MetaMask USD (mUSD) without relying on centralized exchanges. All core actions, such as buying, selling, swapping, and bridging, are built directly into the wallet for a seamless experience.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Buy mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>You can purchase mUSD directly in the MetaMask wallet using credit card, debit card, bank transfer, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or PayPal. </span></li>\n<li><span>Once purchased, tokens are delivered straight to your wallet on </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/ethereum-blockchain-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>Ethereum</span></a><span> or Linea, with more network support coming soon.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Sell mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>MetaMask also supports easy </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/crypto-on-ramps-off-ramps-fiat-conversion-guide/\" auto-attrs><span>off-ramps</span></a><span>. </span></li>\n<li><span>You can sell mUSD and convert it back into cash, sending funds directly to your bank account, PayPal, debit card, or credit card. This eliminates unnecessary steps and keeps fees competitive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Swap mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Swapping mUSD is fast and transparent. MetaMask’s aggregator compares rates across multiple</span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/liquidity/\" auto-attrs><span> liquidity</span></a><span> sources, ensuring you get the best price. </span></li>\n<li><span>Gas fees are included in your quotes, so you always know the exact cost before confirming. mUSD can be swapped for thousands of tokens across Ethereum and Linea.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Bridge mUSD</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Need to move mUSD across blockchains? MetaMask’s bridge feature makes it secure and efficient. The system automatically finds the most cost-effective route, and with </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/cross-transfer-protocol-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>cross-chain swapping</span></a><span>, you can bridge and swap in one transaction.</span></li>\n<li><span>For example, sending mUSD from Ethereum and receiving another token on Linea in a single step. This makes managing mUSD across chains seamless, saving both time and transaction fees.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Why MetaMask Launched mUSD?</span></h2>\n<p><span>MetaMask is not just chasing trends. Stablecoins are now one of the most profitable segments in crypto:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Tether </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/business/tether-financial-muscle-q2-billions-excess-reserves/\" auto-attrs><span>earned over $4.9 billion in Q2 2025</span></a><span>, while supply grew by $13 billion.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/tether-usat-token-us-launch-bo-hines-ceo/\" auto-attrs><span>USA₮, new U.S.-regulated stablecoin</span></a><span> announced by Tether.</span></li>\n<li><span>Circle’s USDC is widely used in DeFi and institutional finance.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/circle-arc-vs-stripe-tempo-vs-robinhood-l2-explained/\" auto-attrs><span>Circle is building Arc, a layer-1 blockchain</span></a><span> purpose-built for stablecoin finance (payments, FX, global settlement, etc.).</span></li>\n<li><span>PayPal entered the game in 2023 with PYUSD, backed by Paxos.</span></li>\n<li><span>Tempo, a blockchain being developed by Stripe (in collaboration with Paradigm), focused on payments, stablecoin-friendly rails, and higher throughput. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>So competition is no longer just about liquidity or backing. It’s about chain features (like native gas in stablecoins), compliance, cross-chain mobility, UX (easy buy/sell/swap/bridge), and how well one can integrate into real payments or business rails. mUSD’s wallet-native advantage is good, but that may not be enough unless the ecosystem keeps growing (liquidity, trading pairs, institutional usage).</span></p>\n<p><span>By launching mUSD, MetaMask can:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Capture a share of the stablecoin market revenue.</span></li>\n<li><span>Create tighter integration between its wallet, DeFi services, and payments.</span></li>\n<li><span>Position Linea as a go-to ecosystem powered by its own stablecoin.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Stablecoin Competitors: Can mUSD Stand Out?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The stablecoin market is crowded, with entrenched leaders and new challengers. For MetaMask USD (mUSD) to succeed, it must carve out space alongside giants like USDT and USDC, while differentiating from entrants like Tether’s USAT, PayPal’s PYUSD and World Liberty Financial’s USD1.</span></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/metamask-usd-musd-wallet-native-stablecoin-transak-stripes-bridge-m0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In a reorg attack, the normal transaction history of a blockchain is rolled back by an attacker who controls enough mining power.</span></p>\n<p><span>Essentially, a miner (or mining pool) with the majority of the network’s computing power can secretly create a longer alternative chain and then publish it. Because most cryptocurrencies follow the rule that “the longest valid chain is the correct one,” all other nodes switch to this new chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>This forces the network to discard the original blocks and any transactions they contained. The result can be dramatic: confirmed payments suddenly vanish and must be reprocessed, which opens the door to double-spending and undermines trust.</span></p>\n<p><span>For </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/xmr-price-breaks-out-monero-largest-ever-chain-reorg/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> and other </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/\" auto-attrs><span>proof-of-work (PoW)</span></a><span> coins, this kind of attack is essentially the same as a 51% attack, where one entity controls more than half of the mining power. In such a scenario, the attacker can block or reverse transactions and undermine the normal security of the blockchain.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Is a Blockchain Reorg Attack?</b></h2>\n<p><span>A </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/monero-jumps-7-despite-51-attack-reorg-kraken/\" auto-attrs><span>blockchain reorganization</span></a><span> attack happens when the transaction chain is rewritten in a way that invalidates some recent blocks. In normal operation, Monero nodes follow the longest chain rule: they always treat the longest valid PoW chain as the official ledger.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-foundation-reshapes-protocol-division-internal-rift/\" auto-attrs><span>In a reorg attack</span></a><span>, however, a miner with exceptional hashpower withholds newly mined blocks instead of broadcasting them immediately. Later, the attacker releases this hidden chain. If their private chain is longer than the public one, all other nodes switch to it as the canonical history.</span></p>\n<p><span>The “lost” </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/whats-inside-the-bitcoin-block/\" auto-attrs><span>blocks</span></a><span> and transactions from the old chain are dropped as if they never happened. For example, in the recent Monero incident, the attacker’s chain overtook the public network, forcing nodes to discard 18 blocks and more than 117 transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>This kind of attack can enable double-spending: the attacker can spend coins on the original chain and then invalidate those transactions when the new chain takes over. In short, a reorg attack exploits PoW’s longest-chain rule to rewrite history, and it typically requires the attacker to have a very large share of the network’s mining power.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What Happened in the Monero Reorg Incident of September 2025?</b></h2>\n<p><span>In mid-September 2025, </span><a href=\"https://x.com/vinibarbosabr/status/1967202524810584454\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Monero suffered its biggest blockchain reorganization in history</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. On September 14, 2025, the network unexpectedly “rolled back” 18 blocks, erasing roughly 36 minutes of transaction history.</span></p>\n<p><span>Independent observers quickly confirmed the event. Researchers reported that the reorganization began at block height 3,499,659 around 5:12 AM UTC and ended at height 3,499,676 about 43 minutes later. In total, around 117–118 previously confirmed transactions were invalidated (as if they never occurred) when the network switched to the attacker’s longer chain.</span></p>\n<p><span>The reorg was linked to </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/qubic-crypto-price-analysis-first-halving-breakout/\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic</span></a><span>, a mining pool and “useful proof-of-work” project led by Sergey Ivancheglo. Qubic had quietly accumulated an exceptionally large share of Monero’s mining hash rate — over 50%. By withholding blocks and then releasing its private chain, Qubic overrode the public Monero blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite reversing many transactions, Monero’s price actually rose 5–7% on the day, possibly because investors saw that no coins were double-spent or stolen. Still, the event marked the deepest reorganization on record for Monero.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because Monero’s protocol always accepts the longest chain as valid, the network had no choice but to accept Qubic’s chain. All blocks mined by honest miners during those 18 blocks were orphaned, and their transactions were sent back to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/glossary/mempool/\" auto-attrs><span>mempool</span></a><span>. In practice, this meant that some users and businesses saw their Monero payments reversed.</span></p>\n<p><span>The incident also shattered the conventional wisdom that waiting for 10 confirmations is enough to finalize a Monero transaction. Analysts noted that ten confirmations no longer provided sufficient assurance after this event. Many exchanges and services temporarily raised their confirmation thresholds to avoid processing risky transactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>By the time the dust settled, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/monero-51-attack-qubic-pool-dogecoin-mark-tehrani-warns/\" auto-attrs><span>Monero</span></a><span> developer and user community was alarmed but not panicked. Researchers confirmed that this rollback was the largest in Monero’s 12-year history and quickly pointed out that it was nearly a repeat of a smaller attack from the previous month.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Has Monero Faced Reorg Attacks Before?</b></h2>\n<p><span>Yes, Monero had a close call just weeks earlier.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>In August 2025, the same </span><a href=\"https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604908675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs><span>Qubic pool targeted Monero with a smaller-scale reorg</span><i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a><span>. Qubic announced that it had performed a 6-block chain reorganization on Monero, orphaning about 60 blocks of history. This move suggested Qubic briefly controlled a majority of the hashing power.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span>Exchanges reacted immediately.

It was an expensive gadget, but one that set the stage for Apple’s rise to trillion-dollar dominance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Eighteen years later, Apple’s latest flagship, iPhone 17, arrives at a familiar-looking $799. On paper, the price hike is modest compared to the revolution under the hood: bigger displays, pro-grade cameras, AI chips, and more storage than entire PCs of the mid-2000s.</span></p>\n<p><span>The real drama emerges when the familiar U.S. dollar is swapped for a very different yardstick: cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\n<p><span>But what if <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/it/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhones were priced<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a> not only in dollars, but also in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP at the time of each launch? Suddenly, the narrative takes an unexpected turn. In certain years, an iPhone would cost only a fraction of a cryptocurrency unit, while in fiat, it would demand an enormous amount.</span></p>\n<p><span>That’s because you’re really watching two things move: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-google-device-cameras-next-wave-mobile-ai/\" auto-attrs>Apple’s pricing strategy</a> and each coin’s cycle of booms, busts, and everything between.</span></p>\n<p><span>\n<div class=\"toplist-table-container js-toplist-container inner-toplist\" data-list-container data-tracking='{\"list_version_id\":null,\"list_id\":\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\",\"list_type\":\"external-linking\",\"list_length\":3,\"list_placement\":\"content\"}' data-ident=\"682de8b555b5e4d2f745737e\" data-country=\"us\">\n            <p class=\"section-title\">Try Our Recommended Crypto Exchanges</p>\n<p class=\"t-label\">\n            Sponsored        </p>\n<p class=\"disc-icon\">Disclosure<i class=\"ccn-icon-disclosure\"></i></p>\n<p class=\"disc-tooltip\">\n        We sometimes use affiliate links in our content, when clicking on those we might receive a commission at no extra cost to you. By using this website you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.    </p>\n<h2><span>Why Measure iPhones in Crypto?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Before diving into the numbers, it’s worth asking: why does this exercise matter?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Perspective on volatility</b><span>: Cryptocurrencies are famous for wild price swings. Pricing something stable, like an <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/special-report/2025/06/11/iphone-prices-through-the-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" auto-attrs>iPhone<i class=\"_s\"> </i><i class=\"ccn-icon-external _i\"></i></a>, in coins rather than dollars makes that volatility tangible.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunity cost lessons</b><span>: Looking back, “spending” BTC or ETH on consumer goods in early years feels like burning treasure. The first iPhone you bought with crypto could today be worth millions, or even billions, in foregone gains.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inflation counterpoint</b><span>: While headlines often talk about <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/technology/apple-slammed-for-sending-inaccurate-ai-new-notifications/\" auto-attrs>iPhone</a> inflation, the real “inflation” often comes from the numéraire (the unit of account) you’re measuring it in.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>iPhones Priced in USD, BTC, ETH and XRP At Launch</span></h2>\n<p><span>For launches with multiple models, this article used the standard (non-Pro) version and the official U.S. street release date (e.g., iPhone 13 on Sept. 24, 2021). </span></p>\n<p><span>Crypto prices reflect approximate daily closing values for that date (or the nearest available trading day). “N/A” indicates the coin was not yet widely traded.</span></p>\n<p><i><span>* 2008–2013 Apple heavily marketed $199 on a two-year contract. Unlocked pricing was significantly higher.</span></i></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-4-year-cycle/\" auto-attrs>BTC had only just begun trading in 2010</a>; the $199 “price” at a few cents per BTC yields thousands of coins, an illustration of illiquid, nascent-market pricing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Apple’s advertised iPhone 12 base was $799, but the SIM-free price many buyers paid was $829; the $799 figure is the canonical launch headline.</span></p>\n<h3><span>What the Timeline Shows</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Early 2010s:</b><span> BTC was tiny; the iPhone’s “BTC cost” was enormous (thousands of BTC in 2010).</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2013–2016:</b><span> XRP appears (2013), ETH launches (2015). Their low early prices make the “coin cost” look huge compared with today.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2017 bull cycle:</b><span> BTC/ETH soared; the BTC/ETH needed for an iPhone collapsed into fractions.</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>2022 bear market to 2024–2025 recovery:</b><span> BTC and ETH rebounded strongly, pushing the coin amounts per iPhone even lower. XRP rose sharply into 2025 as well.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Bitcoin Pricing Highlights How Volatility Shapes Perceived Costs</span></h2>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/analysis/crypto/bitcoin-btc-price-climbs-trend-question/\" auto-attrs>BTC pricing</a> exposes how volatility in crypto can dramatically reshape perceptions of cost, especially for something as familiar as an iPhone.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Bitcoin Cycles and Consumer Costs</span></h3>\n<p><span>Pricing iPhones in Bitcoin often reflects Bitcoin’s own cycles more than Apple’s pricing decisions. For example, the iPhone 6s “cost” almost 2.75 BTC in 2015, while the iPhone 13 was down to 0.019 BTC in 2021. </span></p>\n<p><span>Apple hasn’t drastically reduced its prices, what changes is Bitcoin’s value, which swings the perceived “cost” of a $799 phone by an order of magnitude, depending on the month and year.</span></p>\n<h3><span>ETH and XRP Trends</span></h3>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/digital-asset-treasury-companies-bitcoin-ethereum-solana/\" auto-attrs>Ethereum and XRP</a> follow their own trajectories. Ethereum’s Merge-era dip in September 2022 meant the iPhone 14 “cost” 0.55 ETH, while 2021’s bull run brought the iPhone 13 to just 0.26 ETH. </span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/swifts-ripple-trial-turn-xrp-backbone-global-payments/\" auto-attrs>XRP</a> began with micro-prices, meaning early models cost thousands of tokens. Regulatory wins and market rallies in later years compressed the XRP needed to buy a new phone, creating striking visual contrast in crypto pricing charts.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Stable Dollar Prices Since 2019</span></h3>\n<p><span>In contrast, Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/opinion/business/euro-based-stablecoins-threaten-usd-counterparts-by-2028/\" auto-attrs>dollar pricing</a> for non-Pro iPhones has been stable since 2019. The main models have floated between $699 and $799, with the iPhone 11 at $699 and subsequent models at $799. In 2025, the base model doubled its storage to 256 GB, counteracting some effects of inflation when comparing specifications over time.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Carrier Subsidies and Crypto Conversion</span></h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/iphone-cost-in-btc-eth-xrp-2007-vs-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
