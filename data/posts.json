A scheduled 10.14% price bump to $0.00007241 at Stage 3C adds urgency for those chasing the BullZilla next 1000x, best crypto to invest.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>Create a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask).</li>\n      <li>Fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT.</li>\n      <li>Visit the official BullZilla Presale portal.</li>\n      <li>Connect the wallet, select the desired allocation, and confirm the transaction.</li>\n      <li>After the presale concludes, claim tokens for staking or exchange listing.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>For investors determined to capture the top 100x crypto presales in 2025 and best crypto to invest, <a href=\"https://www.bullzilla.com/?utm_source=Blockonomi&amp;utm_campaign=6%20Best%20Crypto%20to%20Invest:%20One%20Presale%20Attracts%20Whale%20Attention\">Bull Zilla</a> stands out as the bold, high-reward candidate albeit with the high risk inherent in any early-stage meme token.</p>\n<h2>2. Avalanche ($AVAX)</h2>\n<p>Avalanche has positioned itself as one of the leading smart contract platforms, with a consensus protocol that allows near-instant transaction finality and sub-second block times. This efficiency has made it attractive for DeFi projects, NFT marketplaces, and gaming platforms, all of which seek scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Developers have flocked to Avalanche due to its EVM compatibility, which allows Ethereum-based projects to migrate easily while enjoying faster speeds and lower costs.</p>\n<p>In 2025, Avalanche continues to expand partnerships and integrations across the crypto landscape, with increasing use cases in tokenized assets and real-world financial applications. According to DeFiLlama, Avalanche consistently ranks among the top blockchains by total value locked (TVL). While AVAX is no longer in a presale phase, its community continues to treat it like a high-energy meme coin at times, producing content and campaigns that blend serious infrastructure with playful culture.</p>\n<h2>3. Ripple ($XRP)</h2>\n<p>Ripple’s XRP remains one of the most recognizable names in crypto, mainly due to its long-standing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following partial clarity in 2024, XRP has enjoyed renewed attention, and its role in cross-border payments remains critical. Financial institutions continue experimenting with RippleNet for remittances, settlements, and liquidity management, where speed and low fees give it an edge.</p>\n<p>Beyond utility, XRP has the kind of loyal community that keeps it in meme coin discussions. Social media campaigns often drive speculative price movements, turning XRP into a cultural token as much as a financial one. Although not a presale candidate, XRP’s volatility and fan-driven market activity highlight why presales like BullZilla are so appealing: they offer ground-floor exposure before similar hype cycles take hold.</p>\n<h2>4. Cronos ($CRO)</h2>\n<p>Cronos, the token powering the Crypto.com ecosystem, has evolved beyond a utility coin for exchanges into a broader Web3 player. Its chain supports NFTs, dApps, and DeFi protocols, with consistent improvements in scalability and security. Cronos has also benefited from Crypto.com’s marketing dominance, including sports sponsorships and global ad campaigns, which keep the token visible to mainstream audiences.</p>\n<p>For token holders, Cronos offers perks like reduced trading fees, exclusive access to products, and staking incentives. On-chain data shows steady growth in daily transactions, demonstrating healthy ecosystem activity. While CRO trades openly and doesn’t provide presale FOMO, it’s often compared to meme coins because of its community-centric approach and marketing-heavy strategy.</p>\n<h2>5. Toncoin ($TON)</h2>\n<p>Toncoin’s growth has been nothing short of viral, thanks to its integration with Telegram, one of the largest messaging apps in the world. This integration provides TON with immediate exposure to hundreds of millions of users, making seamless in-app crypto transactions a reality. Analysts point out that TON’s transaction speeds and scalability put it in a competitive spot against other Layer 1 chains.</p>\n<p>The meme coin energy stems from Telegram groups, influencers, and viral campaigns, making Toncoin a cultural phenomenon as much as a tech play. In 2025, Toncoin continues to see adoption spikes, with Chainalysis reporting significant wallet growth and transaction volume. While TON is past its presale, its viral nature makes it a natural comparison point for BullZilla’s roaring narrative.</p>\n<h2>6.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Dogecoin remains one of the most recognizable names in the crypto market, largely due to its enduring meme culture and its unique place in the digital asset narrative. Created as a joke, DOGE has since captured the loyalty of millions and become an integral part of retail-driven trading cycles. Today, analysts are once again paying attention as institutional inflows reshape the market. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already attracting billions, speculation has emerged about whether meme coins like Dogecoin could benefit from the spillover effect. Some analysts are now projecting that DOGE could climb as high as $0.50, provided ETF demand continues to push liquidity into the broader market. Alongside legacy meme coins, newer entrants such as <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/m1th\">MAGACOIN FINANCE</a> are also gaining traction, presenting alternative high-upside bets for investors seeking fresh opportunities.</p>\n    <h3>Dogecoin’s ETF Momentum</h3>\n    <p>Dogecoin has historically thrived during waves of speculative enthusiasm, but this time the context is different. The approval of multiple crypto ETFs in 2025 has changed the liquidity landscape, channeling institutional money into the ecosystem at unprecedented levels. While these products do not directly hold DOGE, their success is altering how traders allocate capital. Retail investors in particular often mirror institutional confidence, seeking opportunities in meme-driven assets once Bitcoin and Ethereum establish momentum.</p>\n    <p>With DOGE already integrated into several payment experiments and maintaining strong cultural resonance, analysts argue that it is well-positioned to ride this secondary wave. If ETFs continue attracting inflows at current rates, the market could see liquidity spill over into meme coins, accelerating a run toward the $0.50 target being discussed in trading circles.</p>\n    <h3>The Case For $0.50 DOGE</h3>\n    <p>At present, Dogecoin trades well below the levels seen during its 2021 peak, when it briefly touched $0.73. Supporters say this leaves room for substantial upside if momentum returns. The logic is straightforward: if Dogecoin could achieve such highs without institutional tailwinds, the current environment of ETF-driven liquidity provides a stronger foundation for a repeat performance.</p>\n    <p>Furthermore, DOGE continues to enjoy unparalleled brand recognition. From Elon Musk’s references on social media to its use in grassroots online communities, Dogecoin’s cultural footprint gives it a staying power that many meme tokens lack. Analysts emphasizing the $0.50 target see it less as a speculative stretch and more as a reversion to the historical highs, catalyzed by the broader wave of ETF enthusiasm lifting the market.</p>\n    <p>While Dogecoin commands legacy status, new tokens are emerging to capture speculative capital with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project, quickly becoming a favorite among retail traders and analysts alike. The project distinguishes itself through its completed HashEx and CertiK audits, giving it a legitimacy that sets it apart from most meme-inspired launches.</p>\n    <p>Dogecoin’s ETF narrative is driving bold predictions of a potential surge to $0.50, reminding investors of its enduring cultural power. Yet analysts caution that DOGE’s size makes massive multiples harder to achieve in the current cycle. That’s why many are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale touted as the next meme-driven breakout with 12,500% ROI forecasts. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-vanishing allocations mirror the explosive setups that once defined DOGE’s earliest days. Community momentum is also building, with Telegram and X chatter framing it as a rare chance to ride the next viral token before mainstream adoption. While DOGE may capture steady ETF-driven flows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is where traders believe the truly exponential upside remains hidden.</p>\n    <h3>Meme Coin Competition Intensifies</h3>\n    <p>The meme coin sector has always been highly competitive, with each cycle bringing new contenders. In 2021 it was SHIB that surprised markets, while in 2023–2024 tokens like PEPE took their turn in the spotlight. The current landscape suggests that both legacy players like DOGE and SHIB and newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE could thrive simultaneously, catering to different segments of the market.</p>\n    <p>This coexistence matters for investors. While DOGE provides cultural permanence and liquidity depth, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide exponential growth potential. Balancing both offers a diversified approach, capturing the stability of established names while allowing exposure to fresh speculative momentum. Analysts suggest this dual-track strategy may be the most effective way to navigate the meme coin space heading into 2026.</p>\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>Dogecoin’s path to $0.50 hinges on sustained ETF inflows and the willingness of retail traders to follow institutional signals. If the broader market maintains its bullish trajectory, DOGE could revisit its historical highs, cementing its place as the original meme coin. Yet the spotlight is also expanding. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its <a href=\"https://crypto-economy.com/presale-momentum-best-crypto-presale-magacoin-finance-surpasses-14m-and-13500-investors/\">audits</a>, scarcity, and fast-growing community, is rapidly positioning itself as the next major meme-driven breakout. For investors, the lesson may be clear: pairing established names like Dogecoin with speculative presales could be the smartest way to capture the full spectrum of opportunities in this evolving market.</p>\n    <h4>To learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE, visit:</h4>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://buy.magacoinfinance.com/m1th\">https://magacoinfinance.com\n</a>Access: </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://magacoinfinance.com/access\">https://magacoinfinance.com/access<br/>\n</a>Twitter/X:</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://x.com/magacoinfinance\">https://x.com/magacoinfinance<br/>\n</a>Telegram:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://t.me/magacoinfinance\">https://t.me/magacoinfinance</a>\n    </p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

This decision was highly anticipated and came, to some degree, from political pressure. Yet, with falling fund rates, there are high expectations that decentralized money markets, including Aave crypto, will shine. For this reason, the</span> <span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">focus has been on AAVE USD. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">According to Coingecko, the Aave price is up +126% year-to-date and firm in the past month, adding a decent +7%. Yet, despite the optimism around crypto, with analysts painting bullish projects, including posting solid Aave price prediction posts, AAVE USDT is stable in the last week of trading, adding roughly +1%.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(Source: </span><strong><a class=\"general-link\" href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Coingecko</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">)</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This rather slow price action is when Aave is finding massive adoption. Per DefiLlama, the decentralized money market currently manages over $42Bn. Since 2020, the Aave total value locked (TVL) has been inching higher, translating to higher platform revenue. In 2020, Aave generated just $150,000 in yearly revenue. However, by the end of 2024, this had grown to over $84M.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(Source: </span><strong><a class=\"general-link\" href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/aave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">DefiLlama</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">)</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DISCOVER: </span><a class=\"general-link\" href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/next-1000x-crypto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next 1000X Crypto – Here’s 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x This Year</span></a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"federal-reserve-slashes-rates-to-the-4-to-4-25-range\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Federal Reserve Slashes Rates To The +4% to +4.25% Range</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This revenue is expected to grow this year. With three more months to go, Aave crypto has generated over $77M in revenue, earning $35M. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Looking at historical trends, the low-interest-rate environment in the United States now creates a favorable environment for crypto platforms.

This, he adds, is because they are less correlated with declining traditional USD yields.</span></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Currently, the 1-year Treasury bill yields </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US1Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">hover</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> around 3.62%. Kulechov predicts that treasury yields will continue declining with more rate cuts scheduled in Q4 2025, possibly to the +3% to +4% range by 2027. This dovish environment will make Aave USD yields, specifically on stablecoins like USDC, more attractive.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Historically, in a low fund rate environment, the USDC liquidity rate on Aave v3 has consistently outperformed Treasury bill yields by an average of +0.44%. Research findings show that the yield further spikes, especially during heightened crypto volatility. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">(Source: </span><strong><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://blog.pangea.foundation/defi-heat-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pangea</a></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">)</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As an illustration, during the 2021 bull run, when AAVE USD rose to as high as $670, AAVE USD supply rates rose to +10%. During that time, treasury bills yielded almost zero following aggressive rate cuts to contain the effects of the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">DISCOVER: </span><a class=\"general-link\" href=\"https://99bitcoins.com/cryptocurrency/best-meme-coin-icos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Best Meme Coin ICOs to Invest in 2025</span></a></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"aave-tvl-rising-will-aave-usd-spike-to-400\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aave TVL Rising, Will AAVE USD Spike To $400?</span></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With the Federal Reserve now forcing rates lower just when crypto momentum is picking up and more capital is being funneled to DeFi, AAVE USD could be the biggest beneficiary.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">AAVE derives its value from protocol usage.

Moreover, with lower rates in TradFi, the yields on DeFi platforms, mostly Aave, are more attractive. As such, more users are likely to supply assets, searching for the high supply rate on Aave. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"></span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As leverage and borrow demand rise on Aave, its TVL will increase and so will its utility, pushing AAVE USD towards local resistances.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Vitalik Buterin has finally responded to concerns about Ethereum’s 45-day unstaking queue, explaining that it is important to the network’s defense.</p><p>His comments follow an ongoing debate within the crypto community over the long waiting time.</p><h2>Buterin’s Defence</h2><p>The controversy began when Galaxy Digital’s Michael Marcantonio publicly criticized Ethereum’s lengthy exit queue via X, calling it “troubling.” In the now-deleted posts, he compared the network’s unstaking process to that of Solana’s, which only needs two days.</p><blockquote><p>“Unclear how a network that takes 45 days to return assets can serve as a suitable candidate to power the next era of global capital markets,” read the post.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Sagurton, co-founder of FogoChain, <a href=\"https://x.com/RobertSagurton/status/1968321271646888201\">commented</a> that waiting 45 days or even 2 days for a withdrawal felt too long, suggesting that slow banks are even beating them at UX. Another X user <a href=\"https://x.com/chainyoda/status/1968336722233819288\">responded</a> by clarifying that bank withdrawals are not the same as unstaking.</p><p>Buterin weighed in on the debate, <a href=\"https://x.com/chainyoda/status/1968336722233819288\">saying</a> that staking is about “taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain.” He compared it to a soldier leaving the army, noting that some friction in quitting is necessary since the unit cannot function if its members can walk away at any moment.</p><p>The metric <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/long-wait-for-ether-profits-as-exit-queue-surges-to-record-45-days/\">spiked</a> to a two-year peak of 2.6 million ETH due to institutional accumulation late last week, and has remained high since then. Data from the validatorqueue website <a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\">shows</a> that Ethereum has an exit queue of 2.5 million ETH, with an estimated waiting time of approximately 43 days and 6 hours.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is 442,541 ETH waiting to enter the network, with an expected activation delay of around 7 days and 16 hours. Validator participation also remains strong, with more than 1 million active validators. In total, 35.6 million ETH has been staked, accounting for nearly 30% of the entire token supply.</p><p>The Ethereum co-founder admitted that the current staking queue design is not necessarily “optimal”, but emphasized that if the constants were reduced naively, it would make the chain much less trustworthy from the point of view of any node that does not go online very frequently.</p><h2>Community Backlash</h2><p>Elsewhere, Marcantonio’s comments received some backlash from the X crypto community. Former Consensys product manager Jimmy Ragosa <a href=\"https://x.com/Jrag0x/status/1968280261596184948\">suggested</a> that the wave of criticism against the chain was causing its partners to reconsider their business ties with Galaxy Digital.</p><p>Educator Anthony Sassano <a href=\"https://x.com/sassal0x/status/1968444950527558021\">said</a> he would advise against working with the firm, stressing that deleting tweets did not change the fact that its DeFi lead misunderstood the industry and preferred spreading Ethereum FUD rather than presenting facts. On the other hand, Mike Dudas defended Galaxy, noting that while some stakeholders might distance themselves, the firm had already shown its ability to create value with Solana by connecting to several participants.</p><p>Following the events, crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro <a href=\"https://x.com/lex_node/status/1968379465903550957\">claimed </a>that the company pressured its head of DeFi to delete posts attacking the network, describing the behavior as manipulative.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-justifies-45-day-unstaking-queue-as-vital-to-ethereums-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The chemical industry relies on hydrogen, which is typically made using fossil fuels today.Getty Images</p>\n    <p>Hydrogen is sometimes held up as a master key for the energy transition. It can be made using several low-emissions methods and could play a role in cleaning up industries ranging from agriculture and chemicals to aviation and long-distance shipping.</p>\n    <p>This moment is a complicated one for the green fuel, though, as a new report from the International Energy Agency lays out. A number of major projects face cancellations and delays, especially in the US and Europe. The US in particular is seeing a slowdown after changes to key tax credits and cuts in support for renewable energy. Still, there are bright spots for the industry, including in China, and new markets could soon become crucial for growth.</p>\n    <p>Here are three things to know about the state of hydrogen in 2025.</p>\n    <p>1. Expectations for annual clean hydrogen production by 2030 are shrinking, for the first time.</p>\n    <p>While hydrogen has the potential to serve as a clean fuel, today most is made with processes that use fossil fuels. As of 2025, about a million metric tons of low-emissions hydrogen are produced annually. That’s less than 1% of total hydrogen production.</p>\n    <p>In last year’s Global Hydrogen Report, the IEA projected that global production of low-emissions hydrogen would grow to as high as 49 million metric tons annually by 2030. That prediction has been steadily climbing since 2021, as more places around the world sink money into developing and scaling up the technology.</p>\n    <p>In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA’s production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.</p>\n    <p>That’s still a major expansion from today’s numbers, but it’s the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia.</p>\n    <p>2. China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world’s electrolyzers.</p>\n    <p>A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.</p>\n    <p>But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it’s roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that’s cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>3. Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.</p>\n    <p>There’s an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.</p>\n    <p>International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there’s been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.</p>\n    <p>Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.</p>\n    <p>Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we’ve seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.</p>\n    <p>This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

Now, it’s the world’s third largest AI market — home to 3,700 companies and 60,000 employees, a powerhouse of talent and enterprise — making it an ideal ecosystem for pushing forth the next industrial revolution driven by AI.</p><p>“This is the biggest-ever tech agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom,” said Starmer. He highlighted that the U.K’s work with NVIDIA and the U.S. government is focused on using AI for security and safety for both countries, in addition to business and trade.</p><p><graphic src=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/starmer-quote-pulled-1680x672.jpg\" alt=\"“It’s a historic day.

The next generation of models are expected to have well over a trillion parameters — and are being trained on tens of trillions of <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained/\">tokens</a> of data drawn from text, image and video datasets.</p>\n    <p>Scaling out a data center — harnessing up to thousands of computers to share the work — is necessary to meet this demand. But far greater performance and energy efficiency can come from first scaling up: by making a bigger computer.</p>\n    <p>Blackwell redefines the limits of just how big we can go.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>AI factories are the machines of the next industrial revolution. Their work is AI inference — the most challenging form of computing known today — and their product is intelligence.</p>\n    <p>These factories require infrastructure that can adapt, scale out and maximize every bit of compute resource available.</p>\n    <p>What does that look like?</p>\n    <p>A symphony of compute, networking, storage, power and cooling — with integration at the silicon and systems levels, up and down racks — orchestrated by software that sees tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs as one.</p>\n    <p>The new unit of the data center is <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/\">NVIDIA GB200 NVL72</a>, a rack-scale system that acts as a single, massive GPU.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/one-big-die-vector-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"GB300 Die Vector\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>At the core, the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell superchip unites two Blackwell GPUs with one NVIDIA Grace CPU.</p>\n    <p>Fusing them into a unified compute module — a superchip — boosts performance by an order of magnitude. To do so requires a new high-speed interconnect technology introduced with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture: <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvlink/\">NVIDIA NVLink</a> chip-to-chip.</p>\n    <p>This technology unlocks seamless communication between the CPU and GPUs, enabling them to share memory directly, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput for AI workloads.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Scaling this performance across multiple superchips without bottlenecks was impossible with previous networking technology. So NVIDIA created a new kind of interconnect to keep performance bottlenecks from emerging and enable AI at scale.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/08-on-big-die-vector-nvlink-spine-scaled.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n    <p>The NVIDIA NVLink Switch spine anchors GB200 NVL72 with a precisely engineered web of over 5,000 high-performance copper cables, connecting 72 GPUs across 18 compute trays to move data at a staggering 130 TB/s.</p>\n    <p>That’s fast enough to transfer the entire internet’s peak traffic in less than a second.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>The integration of all this advanced hardware and software, compute and networking enables GB200 NVL72 systems to unlock new possibilities for AI at scale.</p>\n    <p>Each rack weighs one-and-a-half tons — featuring more than 600,000 parts, two miles of wire and millions of lines of code converged.</p>\n    <p>It acts as one giant virtual GPU, making factory-scale AI inference possible, where every nanosecond and watt matters.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>NVIDIA then deconstructed GB200 NVL72 so that partners and customers can configure and build their own NVL72 systems.</p>\n    <p>Each NVL72 system is a two-ton, 1.2-million-part supercomputer.

    "body": "<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s handpicked vaccine recommendation panel has just issued guidance that, if acted on, could overhaul when and how children receive vaccines designed to protect them from dangerous diseases like measles, rubella, and chickenpox.</p>\n<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met on Thursday. In an 8 to 3 vote, they recommended against the use of the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine in children under four. They are instead now recommending that children should only receive two separate vaccines covering these four diseases.</p>\n<h2>Kennedy’s new guard</h2>\n<p>The ACIP has traditionally been a panel of independent experts organized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help steer the country’s vaccine policy. Their recommendations, while non-binding, carry significant weight; many states mandate that children receive all the vaccines recommended by ACIP before entering public school, for instance. But under U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., critics say that ACIP has become a platform for vaccine skepticism.</p>\n<p>In early June, Kennedy <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732\">unilaterally fired</a> all 17 former members of ACIP and then, without any outside review, appointed eight new members, some of whom have previously <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76\">misrepresented</a> science on vaccine safety or who have <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/fda/two-of-kennedys-new-acip-picks-were-paid-expert-witnesses-in-merck-vaccine-cases\">financially benefited</a> from attacking vaccines. Kennedy added five new members to the panel earlier this week, including some individuals who have questioned the safety and effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines.</p>\n<p>At the panel’s last meeting in June, in a majority vote, Kennedy’s new members <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214\">recommended</a> the removal of a mercury-based additive called thimerosal from the very few remaining vaccines that contain it. The recommendation was formally adopted by the government in July. Anti-vaccination proponents have long blamed thimerosal in vaccines for causing autism and other neurological conditions, even after it was phased out from all childhood shots two decades ago out of an abundance of caution. And <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/#:~:text=Twenty%20epidemiologic%20studies%20have%20shown,of%20epidemiologic%20and%20statistical%20methods.\">dozens of studies</a> have since failed to support any link between thimerosal (or, for that matter, any vaccine or specific ingredient) and autism.</p>\n<p>Under Kennedy’s leadership, the CDC has been rocked by a series of high-profile departures. The Centers’ director Susan Monarez was reportedly fired for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa\">reportedly refusing</a> to support Kennedy’s vaccine agenda—a decision that spurred the resignation of several other senior CDC staff and an unprecedented <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819\">public display of support</a> from remaining employees.</p>\n<p>Monarez <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-claimed-cdc-was-killing-children-according-to-former-director-2000660022\">testified</a> at a Senate hearing earlier this week, alleging that Kennedy had pressured her to rubber-stamp recommendations from ACIP. She also stated that Kennedy told her that the childhood vaccine schedule was going to change in September and that she needed to be “on board with it.”</p>\n<h2>What the latest vote means for these vaccines</h2>\n<p>In what was its second meeting since Kennedy dismissed the former members in June, the panel first debated the safety of the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine.</p>\n<p>The MMRV vaccine was approved in 2005 as a convenient alternative to children being given the MMR vaccine and a separate varicella vaccine, providing protection against all four diseases at once. Soon after its release to the public, however, evidence emerged that the first dose of the MMRV vaccine is associated with a slightly increased risk of febrile seizure (seizures caused by a fever) in children under the age of four as compared to the MMR plus varicella vaccine. Importantly, an additional risk of seizure wasn’t seen with the second dose of the MMRV vaccine given to older children.</p>\n<p>The CDC was the first to discover and acknowledge this risk and has <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-faqs-hcp.html\">long recommended</a> that, unless parents specifically request the MMRV vaccines, younger children should receive the MMR plus varicella vaccine as their first dose and the combined MMRV vaccine for the second dose. At Thursday’s ACIP meeting, CDC staff presented data showing that about 85% of parents choose the MMR and a separate varicella vaccine as recommended for the first dose. But since some families may prefer their children taking fewer vaccines overall, parents were advised they could opt for either vaccine strategy.</p>\n<p>Febrile seizures are certainly scary for both the parent and for the child to experience. However, they’re generally short-lasting and aren’t often <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/febrile-seizures\">linked</a> to longer-term health problems. In turn, the vast majority of these kinds of seizures aren’t tied to vaccination but to infections.</p>\n<p>The long and short of it is that this change is wholly unnecessary, given that most parents take the CDC’s advice and don’t use the MMRV vaccine for the first dose. But the ACIP’s vote will effectively remove a family’s right to decide which shot their young children receive—an ironic fate given how anti-vaccination proponents often frame their decision to not vaccinate themselves or their children as an expression of freedom.</p>\n<p>CDC staff noted that the ACIP’s recommendation could affect Medicaid coverage of these vaccines, as well as coverage offered through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, a federal program that provides vaccines to families unable to afford them. And it’s possible that some children who would have received the MMRV vaccine will end up not receiving the two separate vaccines for any number of reasons.</p>\n<p>That said, the ACIP voted ‘No’ on whether the VFC should change its coverage in alignment with the new recommendation. This means that the program should stick to its existing coverage of the MMRV vaccine.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-handpicked-vaccine-panel-nixes-measles-chickenpox-combo-for-kids-under-4-2000660333\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In addition to our Fairwater datacenter in Wisconsin, we also have multiple identical Fairwater datacenters under construction in other locations across the US.</p>\n<p>In Narvik, Norway, <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/features/the-port-town-in-norway-emerging-as-an-ai-hub/\">Microsoft announced plans with nScale and Aker JV</a> to develop a new hyperscale AI datacenter.</p>\n<p>In Loughton, UK, we announced <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/16/microsoft-30-billion-uk-ai-future/\">a partnership with nScale to build the UK’s largest supercomputer</a> to support services in the UK.</p>\n<p>These AI datacenters are significant capital projects, representing tens of billions of dollars of investments and hundreds of thousands of cutting-edge AI chips, and will seamlessly connect with our global Microsoft Cloud of over 400 datacenters in 70 regions around the world. Through innovation that can enable us to link these AI datacenters in a distributed network, we multiply the efficiency and compute in an exponential way to further democratize access to AI services globally.</p>\n<p>So what is an AI datacenter?</p>\n<h3><strong>The AI datacenter: the new factory of the AI era</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OMB-Image-1-Datacenter.jpg\"><graphic decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-52562574 size-full\" src=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OMB-Image-1-Datacenter.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Microsoft's new AI datacenter campus in Mt.

Microsoft’s AI datacenters power OpenAI, Microsoft AI, our Copilot capabilities and many more leading AI workloads.</p>\n<p>The new Fairwater AI datacenter in Wisconsin stands as a remarkable feat of engineering, covering 315 acres and housing three massive buildings with a combined 1.2 million square feet under roofs. Constructing this facility required 46.6 miles of deep foundation piles, 26.5 million pounds of structural steel, 120 miles of medium-voltage underground cable and 72.6 miles of mechanical piping.</p>\n<p>Unlike typical cloud datacenters, which are optimized to run many smaller, independent workloads such as hosting websites, email or business applications, this datacenter is built to work as one massive AI supercomputer using a single flat networking interconnecting hundreds of thousands of the latest NVIDIA GPUs. In fact, it will deliver 10X the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.</p>\n<h3><strong>The role of our AI datacenters – powering frontier AI</strong></h3>\n<p>Effective AI models rely on thousands of computers working together, powered by GPUs, or specialized AI accelerators, to process massive concurrent mathematical computations. They’re interconnected with extremely fast networks so they can share results instantly, and all of this is supported by enormous storage systems that hold the data (like text, images or video) broken down into tokens, the small units of information the AI learns from. The goal is to keep these chips busy all the time, because if the data or the network can’t keep up, everything slows down.</p>\n<p>The AI training itself is a cycle: the AI processes tokens in sequence, makes predictions about the next one, checks them against the right answers and adjusts itself. This repeats trillions of times until the system gets better at whatever it’s being trained to do. Think of it like a professional football team’s practice. Each GPU is a player running a drill, the tokens are the plays being executed step by step, and the network is the coaching staff, shouting instructions and keeping everyone in sync. The team repeats plays over and over, correcting mistakes until they can execute them perfectly. By the end, the AI model, like the team, has mastered its strategy and is ready to perform under real game conditions.</p>\n<h3><strong>AI infrastructure at frontier scale</strong></h3>\n<p>Purpose-built infrastructure is critical to being able to power AI efficiently. To compute the token math at this trillion-parameter scale of leading AI models, the core of the AI datacenter is made up of dedicated AI accelerators (such as GPUs) mounted on server boards alongside CPUs, memory and storage. A single server hosts multiple GPU accelerators, connected for high-bandwidth communication. These servers are then installed into a rack, with top-of-rack (ToR) switches providing low-latency networking between them. Every rack in the datacenter is interconnected, creating a tightly coupled cluster. From the outside, this architecture looks like many independent servers, but at scale it functions as a single supercomputer where hundreds of thousands of accelerators can train a single model in parallel.</p>\n<p>This datacenter runs a single, massive cluster of interconnected NVIDIA GB200 servers and millions of compute cores and exabytes of storage, all engineered for the most demanding AI workloads. Azure was the first cloud provider to bring online the NVIDIA GB200 server, rack and full datacenter clusters. Each rack packs 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, tied together in a single NVLink domain that delivers 1.8 terabytes of GPU-to-GPU bandwidth and gives every GPU access to 14 terabytes of pooled memory. Rather than behaving like dozens of separate chips, the rack operates as a single, giant accelerator, capable of processing an astonishing 865,000 tokens per second, the highest throughput of any cloud platform available today. The Norway and UK AI datacenters will use similar clusters, and take advantage of NVIDIAs next AI chip design (GB300) which offers even more pooled memory per rack.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/18/inside-the-worlds-most-powerful-ai-datacenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Last week, a prominent US senator called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Microsoft for cybersecurity negligence over the role it played last year in health giant Ascension's ransomware breach, which caused life-threatening disruptions at 140 hospitals and put the medical records of 5.6 million patients into the hands of the attackers. Lost in the focus on Microsoft was something as, or more, urgent: never-before-revealed details that now invite scrutiny of Ascension’s own security failings.</p>\n    <p>In a letter sent last week to FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said an investigation by his office determined that the hack began in February 2024 with the infection of a contractor's laptop after they downloaded malware from a link returned by Microsoft’s Bing search engine. The attackers then pivoted from the contractor device to Ascension’s most valuable network asset: the Windows Active Directory, a tool administrators use to create and delete user accounts and manage system privileges to them. Obtaining control of the Active Directory is tantamount to obtaining a master key that will open any door in a restricted building.</p>\n    <p>Wyden blasted Microsoft for its continued support of its three-decades-old implementation of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)\">Kerberos</a> authentication protocol that uses an insecure cipher and, as the senator noted, exposes customers to precisely the type of breach Ascension suffered. Although modern versions of Active Directory by default will use a more secure authentication mechanism, it will by default fall back to the weaker one in the event a device on the network—including one that has been infected with malware—sends an authentication request that uses it. That enabled the attackers to perform <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/what-is-kerberoasting-attack/\">Kerberoasting</a>, a form of attack that Wyden said the attackers used to pivot from the contractor laptop directly to the crown jewel of Ascension’s network security.</p>\n    <h2>A researcher asks: “Why?”</h2>\n    <p>Left out of Wyden’s letter—and in social media posts that discussed it—was any scrutiny of Ascension’s role in the breach, which, based on Wyden’s account, was considerable. Chief among the suspected security lapses is a weak password. By definition, Kerberoasting attacks work only when a password is weak enough to be cracked, raising questions about the strength of the one the Ascension ransomware attackers compromised.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/how-weak-passwords-and-other-failings-led-to-catastrophic-breach-of-ascension/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

With this launch, Amazon Bedrock continues to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/model-choice/\">expand model choice</a> by adding access to Qwen3 open weight <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/\">foundation models (FMs</a>) in a full managed, serverless way. This release includes four models: <strong>Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct</strong>, <strong>Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507</strong>, and <strong>Qwen3-32B (Dense)</strong>. Together, these models feature both mixture-of-experts (MoE) and dense architectures, providing flexible options for different application requirements.</p>\n<p>Amazon Bedrock provides access to industry-leading FMs through a unified API without requiring infrastructure management. You can access models from multiple model providers, integrate models into your applications, and scale usage based on workload requirements. With Amazon Bedrock, customer data is never used to train the underlying models. With the addition of Qwen3 models, Amazon Bedrock offers even more options for use cases like:</p>\n<ul><li>Code generation and repository analysis with extended context understanding</li><li>Building agentic workflows that orchestrate multiple tools and APIs for business automation</li><li>Balancing AI costs and performance using hybrid thinking modes for adaptive reasoning</li></ul>\n<p><strong> Qwen3 models in Amazon Bedrock</strong>These four Qwen3 models are now available in Amazon Bedrock, each optimized for different performance and cost requirements:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct</strong>– This is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 480B total parameters and 35B active parameters. It’s optimized for coding and agentic tasks and achieves strong results in benchmarks such as agentic coding, browser use, and tool use. These capabilities make it suitable for repository-scale code analysis and multistep workflow automation.</li><li><strong>Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct</strong>– This is a MoE model with 30B total parameters and 3B active parameters. Specifically optimized for coding tasks and instruction-following scenarios, this model demonstrates strong performance in code generation, analysis, and debugging across multiple programming languages.</li><li><strong>Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507</strong>– This is an instruction-tuned MoE model with 235B total parameters and 22B active parameters. It delivers competitive performance across coding, math, and general reasoning tasks, balancing capability with efficiency.</li><li><strong>Qwen3-32B (Dense)</strong>– This is a dense model with 32B parameters. It is suitable for real-time or resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices and edge computing deployments where consistent performance is critical.</li></ul>\n<p><u>Architectural and functional features in Qwen3</u><br/> The Qwen3 models introduce several architectural and functional features:</p>\n<p><strong>MoE compared with dense architectures – </strong>MoE models such as Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B, Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, activate only part of the parameters for each request, providing high performance with efficient inference. The dense Qwen3-32B activates all parameters, offering more consistent and predictable performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Agentic capabilities – </strong>Qwen3 models can handle multi-step reasoning and structured planning in one model invocation. They can generate outputs that call external tools or APIs when integrated into an agent framework. The models also maintain extended context across long sessions. In addition, they support tool calling to allow standardized communication with external environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid thinking modes – </strong>Qwen3 introduces a hybrid approach to problem-solving, which supports two modes: thinking and non-thinking. The thinking mode applies step-by-step reasoning before delivering the final answer. This is ideal for complex problems that require deeper thought. Whereas the non-thinking mode provides fast and near-instant responses for less complex tasks where speed is more important than depth. This helps developers manage performance and cost trade-offs more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-context handling – </strong>The Qwen3-Coder models support extended context windows, with up to 256K tokens natively and up to 1 million tokens with extrapolation methods. This allows the model to process entire repositories, large technical documents, or long conversational histories within a single task.</p>\n<p><strong> When to use each model</strong>The four Qwen3 models serve distinct use cases. Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct is designed for complex software engineering scenarios. It’s suited for advanced code generation, long-context processing such as repository-level analysis, and integration with external tools. Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct is particularly effective for tasks such as code completion, refactoring, and answering programming-related queries. If you need versatile performance across multiple domains, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 offers a balance, delivering strong general-purpose reasoning and instruction-following capabilities while leveraging the efficiency advantages of its MoE architecture. Qwen3-32B (Dense) is appropriate for scenarios where consistent performance, low latency, and cost optimization are important.</p>\n<p><strong> Getting started with Qwen models in Amazon Bedrock</strong>To begin using Qwen models, in the </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-west-2#modelaccess&amp;trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el\">Amazon Bedrock console</a>, I choose</p>\n<p><strong>Model Access</strong>from the</p>\n<p><strong>Configure and learn section</strong>of the navigation pane.

    "body": "<p>Connecting to an application should be as simple as knowing its name. Yet, many security models still force us to rely on brittle, ever-changing IP addresses. And we heard from many of you that managing those ever-changing IP lists was a constant struggle. </p>\n<p>Today, we’re taking a major step toward making that a relic of the past.</p>\n<p>We're excited to announce that you can now route traffic to <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\"><u>Cloudflare Tunnel</u></a> based on a hostname or a domain. This allows you to use Cloudflare Tunnel to build simple zero-trust and egress policies for your private and public web applications without ever needing to know their underlying IP. This is one more step on our <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/egress-policies-by-hostname/\"><u>mission</u></a> to strengthen platform-wide support for hostname- and domain-based policies in the <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/\"><u>Cloudflare One</u></a> SASE platform, simplifying complexity and improving security for our customers and end users. </p>\n<h2>Grant access to applications, not networks</h2>\n<p>In August 2020, the National Institute of Standards (NIST) published <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf\"><u>Special Publication 800-207</u></a>, encouraging organizations to abandon the \"castle-and-moat\" model of security (where trust is established on the basis of network location) and move to a Zero Trust model (where we “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf\"><u>verify anything and everything attempting to establish access</u></a>\").</p>\n<p>Now, instead of granting broad network permissions, you grant specific access to individual resources. This concept, known as per-resource authorization, is a cornerstone of the Zero Trust framework, and it presents a huge change to how organizations have traditionally run networks. Per-resource authorization requires that access policies be configured on a per-resource basis. By applying the principle of least privilege, you give users access only to the resources they absolutely need to do their job. This tightens security and shrinks the potential attack surface for any given resource.</p>\n<p>Instead of allowing your users to access an entire network segment, like <pre><strong>10.131.0.0/24</strong></pre>, your security policies become much more precise. For example:</p>\n<ul><li><p>Only employees in the \"SRE\" group running a managed device can access <pre><strong>admin.core-router3-sjc.acme.local</strong></pre>.</p></li><li><p>Only employees in the \"finance\" group located in Canada can access <pre><strong>canada-payroll-server.acme.local</strong></pre>.</p></li><li><p>All employees located in New York can access<strong> </strong><pre><strong>printer1.nyc.acme.local</strong></pre>.</p></li></ul>\n<p>Notice what these powerful, granular rules have in common? They’re all based on the resource’s private <strong>hostname</strong>, not its IP address. That’s exactly what our new hostname routing enables. We’ve made it dramatically easier to write effective zero trust policies using stable hostnames, without ever needing to know the underlying IP address.</p>\n<p>Let's imagine you need to secure an internal server, <pre><strong>canada-payroll-server.acme.local</strong></pre>. It’s hosted on internal IP <pre><strong>10.4.4.4</strong></pre> and its hostname is available in internal private DNS, but not in public DNS. In a modern cloud environment, its IP address is often the least stable thing about it. If your security policy is tied to that IP, it's built on a shaky foundation.</p>\n<p>This happens for a few common reasons:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Cloud instances</strong>: When you launch a compute instance in a cloud environment like AWS, you're responsible for its <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hostname-types.html\"><u>hostname</u></a>, but not always its IP address. As a result, you might only be tracking the hostname and may not even know the server's IP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Load Balancers</strong>: If the server is behind a load balancer in a cloud environment (like AWS ELB), its IP address could be changing dynamically in response to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/application-load-balancers.html\"><u>changes in traffic</u></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ephemeral infrastructure</strong>: This is the \"<a href=\"https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/\"><u>cattle, not pets</u></a>\" world of modern infrastructure. Resources like servers in an autoscaling group, containers in a Kubernetes cluster, or applications that spin down overnight are created and destroyed as needed. They keep a persistent hostname so users can find them, but their IP is ephemeral and changes every time they spin up.</p></li></ul>\n<p>To cope with this, we've seen customers build complex scripts to maintain dynamic \"IP Lists\" — mappings from a hostname to its IPs that are updated every time the address changes. While this approach is clever, maintaining IP Lists is a chore. They are brittle, and a single error could cause employees to lose access to vital resources.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, hostname-based routing makes this IP List workaround obsolete.</p>\n<p>To see this in action, let's create a policy from our earlier example: we want to grant employees in the \"finance\" group located in Canada access to <pre><strong>canada-payroll-server.acme.local</strong></pre>. Here’s how you do it, without ever touching an IP address.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Connect your private network</strong></p>\n<p>First, the server's network needs a secure connection to Cloudflare's global network. You do this by installing our lightweight agent, <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/\"><u>cloudflared</u></a>, in the same local area network as the server, which creates a secure Cloudflare Tunnel. You can create a new tunnel directly from cloudflared by running <pre><strong>cloudflared tunnel create &lt;TUNNEL-NAME&gt;</strong></pre> or using your Zero Trust dashboard.</p>\n<p style=\"position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%;\">\n  \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Step 2: Route the hostname to the tunnel</strong></p>\n<p>This is where the new capability comes into play. In your Zero Trust dashboard, you now establish a route that binds the <i>hostname</i> <pre>canada-payroll-server.acme.local</pre> directly to that tunnel. In the past, you could only route an IP address (<pre>10.4.4.4)</pre> or its subnet (<pre>10.4.4.0/24</pre>). That old method required you to create and manage those brittle IP Lists we talked about. Now, you can even route entire domains, like <pre>*.acme.local</pre>, directly to the tunnel, simply by creating a hostname route to <pre>acme.local</pre>.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/tunnel-hostname-routing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>September 16, 2025</p>\n<p>Gal Elidan, Research Scientist, and Yael Haramaty, Senior Product Manager, Google Research</p>\n<p>New research into GenAI in education demonstrates a novel approach to reimagining textbooks that led to improved learning outcomes in a recent study. The research comes to life in our interactive experience, Learn Your Way, now available on Google Labs.</p>\n<h2>Quick links</h2>\n<p>Textbooks are a cornerstone of education, but they have a fundamental limitation: they are a one-size-fits-all medium. The manual creation of textbooks demands significant human effort, and as a result they lack alternative perspectives, multiple formats and tailored variations that can make learning more effective and engaging. At Google, we’re exploring how we can use generative AI (GenAI) to automatically generate alternative representations or personalized examples, while preserving the integrity of the source material. What if students had the power to shape their own learning journey, exploring materials using various formats that fit their evolving needs? What if we could reimagine the textbook to be as unique as every learner?</p>\n<p>Recent advances in GenAI are bringing this vision closer to reality. Today we are excited to introduce <a href=\"https://learnyourway.withgoogle.com/\">Learn Your Way</a>, now on <a href=\"https://labs.google/\">Google Labs</a>, a research experiment that explores how GenAI can transform educational materials to create a more effective, engaging, learner-driven experience for every student. Here we outline the research and pedagogy underpinning Learn Your Way, with more details in the accompanying <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13348\">tech report</a>. We also report early indicators of its impact: in our efficacy study, students using Learn Your Way scored 11 percentage points higher on retention tests than students using a standard digital reader.</p>\n<h2>Grounded in learning, built for the student</h2>\n<p>Our approach is built on two key pillars that work together to augment the learning experience: (1) generating various multimodal representations of the content, and (2) taking foundational steps toward personalization.</p>\n<p>The seminal <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225249172_Dual_Coding_Theory_and_Education\">dual coding theory</a> states that forging mental connections between different representations strengthens the underlying conceptual schema in our brain. Subsequent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131599000299\">research</a> indeed showed that when students actively engage with information in various formats, they build a more robust and complete mental model of the material. Inspired by this, our approach empowers students with the agency to choose and intermix multiple formats and modalities to best help them understand the material. In addition, personalization is increasingly becoming an <a href=\"https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10274018\">aspirational standard</a> in K-12 educational settings, and so our research reflects this. We aim to enhance the relatability and effectiveness of educational content by adapting it to student attributes. Moreover, we incorporate quizzing capabilities that enable us to further tailor the experience according to the learners’ real-time responses. Such personalization can be a powerful method for <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320564894_The_Role_of_Situational_Interest_in_Personalized_Learning\">enhancing motivation</a> and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/00346543221148478\">deepening learning</a>.</p>\n<p>Bringing this to life involves a layered technical approach using <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-learnlm-gemini-generative-ai/\">LearnLM</a>, our best-in-class pedagogy-infused family of models, now integrated directly into <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/\">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>. The first layer is a unique personalization pipeline that serves as the basis for the second layer of multiple content representations. Our starting point is a textbook PDF, although our approach could be used with other forms of source material.</p>\n<h3>The personalization pipeline</h3>\n<p>The Learn Your Way interface asks the learner to select their grade and interests (e.g., sports, music, food). The original source material is first re-leveled to the learner’s reported grade level, while maintaining the scope of its content. This is followed by the strategic replacement of generic examples with ones that are personalized to the learner’s reported interests. The resulting text serves as the basis for the generation of all the other representations, effectively propagating the personalization effect and setting up a pipeline for further personalization.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Personalization of a generic text describing Newton’s law for two learner profiles (top) provides the basis for following representations of the content (bottom).</i>\n    </p>\n<h3>Multiple representations of content</h3>\n<p>Following the source personalization, we generate multiple representations of the content. For some content representations, such as mind maps and timelines, Gemini’s broad capabilities are used directly. Other features such as narrated slides, require more elaborate pipelines that weave together multiple specialized AI agents and tools to achieve an effective pedagogical result. Finally, specialized tasks, such as generating effective educational visuals, proved too challenging even for state-of-the-art general-purpose image models. To overcome this, we fine-tuned a dedicated model specifically for generating educational illustrations. The combination of a powerful base model, multi-step agentic workflows, and fine-tuned components allows us to generate a wide range of high-quality multimodal representations for learning.</p>\n<h2>The Learn Your Way experience</h2>\n<p>Our research comes to life in Learn Your Way. The interface brings together multiple, personalized representations of content including: (1) immersive text, (2) section-level quizzes, (3) slides &amp; narration, (4) audio lessons, and (5) mind maps.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/learn-your-way-reimagining-textbooks-with-generative-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

<strong>What if I don't want to buy a new iPhone?</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>If you want to continue using your older iPhone that isn't supported by iOS 26, that's fine. However, you'll eventually miss out on security updates which could potentially put your phone at risk for malware and other threats. Additionally, some apps may stop working if they require a certain version of iOS or later. And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.</p>\n<h2>Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26. Apple released the former to address security issues, so you can at least download that one if you're unsure about all the big changes on iOS 26. It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.</p>\n<p>However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>iOS 26 features to try out first</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p><strong>Liquid Glass design</strong><strong>:</strong> Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-to-download-ios-26-see-if-your-iphone-is-eligible-for-the-free-update-first-191854926.html?src=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Once you do, get ready to see a slew of changes, including a new clear design called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>. The translucent look can be found within apps as well as your lock and home screens.

The overhaul is one of several big changes that come with iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a>, watchOS and the rest of Apple's software suite — the new operating system updates for those gadgets are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-ipados-26-watchos-26-and-macos-26-will-be-released-on-september-15-182024821.html\">also available to download now</a>.</p>\n<p>You'll also see multiple useful additions in the Phone and Messages apps. For instance, the ability to weed out spam texts or unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. And for fun, you can now create polls in group texts. Other new improvements coming include <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-airpods-4-with-anc-and-airpods-pro-2-will-also-support-live-translation-184235997.html\">a confirmed AirPods live translation feature</a>, and a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center.</p>\n<p>If you're planning to upgrade your phone this year, take a look at all the new models Apple unveiled during its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-iphone-17-hands-on-no-plus-no-problem-192747122.html\">iPhone 17</a> event, from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-pro-hands-on-the-unibody-and-camera-plateau-feel-more-significant-in-person-185553855.html\">iPhone 17 lineup</a> (check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-review-closer-to-pro-110055511.html\">review of the iPhone 17</a>) to the all-new ultra-thin <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\">iPhone Air</a> (take a look at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">our hands-on review</a>).

We've rounded up a full list of new features you'll have to check out.</p>\n<h2>What is iOS 26 and should I download iOS 18.7 first?</h2>\n<p>Instead of releasing iOS 19, Apple skipped its naming convention ahead to iOS 26. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems were released in 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Apple also released iOS 18.7 alongside iOS 26 to address security issues — great news if you don't have a phone that's eligible to run the latest OS. If you're wondering which one to download first, it's really up to you. Do you want to wait for Apple to quash any bugs in iOS 26 or do you want access to all the new features everyone's talking about now?</p>\n<h2>What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F&amp;source=engadget_article_commerce_ctrl\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see.</p>\n<p>While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, while it was in beta mode, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: The company says Liquid Glass was designed to make all of its platforms more cohesive.</p>\n<p>Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic looks with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2>How to turn iOS 26 Liquid Glass settings off</h2>\n<p>If you find you don't like the new clear look after downloading iOS 26, you can change a couple Accessibility settings, though you can't completely turn off Liquid Glass. For starters, you can reduce the liquid look by going to Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Motion &gt; toggle on Reduce Motion.</p>\n<p>You can make your drop-down menus more opaque instead of translucent by going to Settings &gt;Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; toggle on Reduce Transparency.</p>\n<p>You can also change your clear apps back to the way they were. Just press and hold any app on your screen and select Edit Home Screen. From here, tap Edit (top left) and Customize.

But instead of just the </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/breaking-down-the-subtle-genius-of-john-carpenters-hall-1819923188\">original film</a>or the more recent</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/halloween-michael-myers-tv-rights-miramax-horror-films-1850922460\">trilogy</a>, we’re getting three installments that’ve been surprisingly grouped together.</p>\n    <p>Along with the original 1978 <i>Halloween, </i>both <i>Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers </i>and <i>Halloween</i> <i>5: The Revenge of Michael Myers </i>are also coming back to the big screen. The trio’s cinematic return comes courtesy of Trancas International Films and CineLife Entertainment.</p>\n    <p>While the press release features quotes from CineLife and Trancas executives about the franchise being perfect for the season and the joy of the cinematic experience, the reason for this specific trio is a bit confounding. Trancas has been involved with the <i>Halloween </i>films since the first movie—the second and third films being the sole exceptions—but that’s the only real link between these movies.<i> </i></p>\n    <p>The two <i>Halloween </i>sequels take place a decade or so later from the original movie, with Michael Myers—played by George P. Wilbur in <i>4 </i>and Donald L. Shanks in <i>5</i>—waking up from a coma at the start of each film and spending both of them trying to kill his niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Both films are part of the “Thorn Trilogy” arc that’s mostly explored in the sixth film, 1995’s <i>The Curse of Michael Myers</i>. Neither <i>Return</i> nor <i>Revenge</i> was critically well-regarded upon release, but of the two, <i>Return</i> has been looked at more favorably in the years since.</p>\n    <p>You can head to the theater to see the first <i>Halloween, Return, </i>or <i>Revenge </i>in select cities. The first film is screening starting tomorrow, September 19, and the re-releases are expected to last through the end of October.

    "body": "<p><i>Star</i> <i>Trek</i>‘s utopian vision for an equal society, especially in terms of gender equality, has always been <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-sexist-legacy-in-star-trek-s-progressive-universe-1844147116\">a complicated aspect</a> of its idealized vision. It’s true that the franchise has a legacy of beloved, nuanced female characters and has championed putting those characters in the spotlight over six decades of storytelling. But it’s equally true that <i>Star Trek</i>‘s often conservative vision of women in leadership roles, as figures of desire, and as beholden to the stories of male characters has sat hand in hand with that feminist progressivism.</p>\n<p>There are perhaps, however, few individual seasons of <i>Star Trek</i> from the past 60 years that reflect that dichotomy more than <i>Strange New Worlds</i><i>‘ </i><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-quality-season-4-2000658880\">recently concluded third</a>.</p>\n<p>On paper, <i>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</i> arguably has one of the largest groups of female characters in its primary cast. Of the current main crew, just four of the show’s central characters are men—Pike, Spock, M’Benga, and this season’s addition of Martin Quinn as the younger Montgomery Scott—in comparison to six women: Una, Uhura, La’an, Ortegas, Chapel, and Pelia. That gap has only grown over the course of the show’s life, with Pelia replacing former chief engineer Hemmer after season one, and even the increased prominence of guest characters like Paul Wesley’s young Jim Kirk has been balanced by an increasingly prominent role for Melanie Scrofano’s Marie Batel (especially this season, as we’ll get into).</p>\n<p>Those female characters have also served to facilitate some of <i>Strange New Worlds</i>‘ standout episodes and arcs thus far as well. Uhura’s initial focus as the new perspective aboard the <i>Enterprise</i> in season one flourished across episodes like “<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-recap-season-1-episode-2-1848913460\">Children of the Comet</a>” or in her mentee relationship with Hemmer. La’an’s history with the Gorn played a significant role in <i>Strange New Worlds</i>‘ characterization of the species (for better or worse), and she was given space to process both that and, in episodes like “<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-recap-season-2-episode-3-1850546334\">Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</a>“, her complicated relationship to Khan and the Augments. Una’s revelation of her Illyrian heritage was made a climactic point in the final moments of the show’s first season, leading to a character-defining turn for actress Rebecca Romijn in the season two episode “<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-recap-season-2-episode-2-1850546202\">Ad Astra Per Aspera</a>“.</p>\n<p>But, at times, those female characters were also underserved in those first two seasons—a problem exacerbated by season three, rather than wholly created by it. Nurse Chapel’s arc in the first two seasons largely hinged on her will-they-won’t-they relationship with Spock, fizzling out almost immediately after the two were allowed to get together (shortchanging another great female character in Spock’s Vulcan fiancee, T’Pring, played by guest star Gia Sandhu). Ortegas, meanwhile, was regularly criticized for never really getting her own moment to shine in the show, constantly seeking a storyline outside of a perfunctory exploration of her role as the <i>Enterprise </i>helmsperson (a frustration compounded by the fact that the character, a veteran of <i>Discovery</i>‘s Klingon-Federation war, was only ever allowed to be aggressively distrusting of Klingons or other alien species or simply say things like “I fly the ship”).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, of the various factors that led to <i>Strange New Worlds</i>‘ third season failing to come even close to the mark left by seasons one and two—an experimental breadth of tone and genre leading to more misses than swings, an overreliance on connection to <i>Star Trek</i>‘s past, and an ongoing issue of its episodic format increasingly being in friction with the show’s character work, among other things—one that stood out the most was that these prior issues the show had with underserving some of its female characters suddenly began impacting almost all of them.</p>\n<p>Across its third season, it has consistently felt like <i>Strange New Worlds</i> has had little idea of where it wanted to take its characters, but especially so with its female ones. Prior arcs like La’an’s traumatic history with the Gorn were dropped or shuffled onto other characters: Ortegas sustains a nearly fatal injury from a Gorn attack in the season’s premiere, setting her up to take on that arc instead, to mixed results—it’s not touched on notably until the penultimate episode of the season, “Terrarium,” in which she’s forced to work with a similarly stranded Gorn pilot, but Erica’s attitude towards hostile species and her own traumatic memory of her injury are almost immediately dropped in the episode with little examination as to why.</p>\n<p>Una’s relationship as an Illyrian, a genetically modified humanoid who won legal precedent against Starfleet’s rules against such species being part of the Federation, manifested less as an arc for her and more as a plot device when she essentially became a “magic blood” donor to save Captain Batel’s life.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-3-women-romance-2000660935\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Here are the details.</p>\n    <p>As is tradition, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkr58Sa2GeY\">iFixit has kicked off</a> its teardown season for the devices and accessories unveiled during Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event earlier this month.</p>\n    <p>The first of the bunch was the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Air-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B0FQFH9BST/?tag=marcmendes-20\">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a>, designed to provide up to 65% additional charge for heavy users who may find the <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-review/\">iPhone Air</a>’s battery insufficient for all-day use.</p>\n    <p>Upon measuring the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Air-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B0FQFH9BST/?tag=marcmendes-20\">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a>, iFixIt observed that the battery pack is 7.64mm thin, which is actually thicker than the iPhone Air’s 5.6mm chassis (minus the camera plateau).</p>\n    <p>This led them to an obvious question:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>“Hang on a minute, though. This battery pack is thicker than the iPhone Air, so</p><br/>you’d expect to have a much bigger battery inside. Why only 65% additional charge?”</blockquote>\n    <h2>So, they looked into it. Literally.</h2>\n    <p>As it turns out, inside the plastic shell of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Air-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B0FQFH9BST/?tag=marcmendes-20\">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a>, there seems to be the exact same battery as the <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-review/\">iPhone Air</a> itself. Or at the very least, a battery shaped exactly like the one Apple showcased during the Awe-Dropping event, as it detailed the <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-review/\">iPhone Air</a>’s hardware specs.</p>\n    <p>Moreover, the actual battery is 2.72mm thin, which, as iFixIt observes, is “thin enough to fit inside the 5.6mm iPhone Air.”</p>\n    <p>As for why, then, the battery pack will offer just up to 65% of additional charge, iFixIt notes that inefficiencies in wireless charging may be to blame. And while 35% of wasted energy during the wireless charging process could be deemed high by many, they still note that the numbers seem to make sense.</p>\n    <p>Be that as it may, with the iPhone Air now starting to arrive in the hands of early customers worldwide, we’re likely just days away from finding out whether Apple really used the exact same battery in both the iPhone Air and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Air-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B0FQFH9BST/?tag=marcmendes-20\">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a>, or if it simply opted for a similarly shaped, lower-capacity cell to streamline at least one part of the manufacturing process.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-air-review/\">Be sure to read 9to5Mac’s review of the iPhone Air</a>\n    </p>\n    <h4>Accessory deals on Amazon</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=marcmendes-20\">AirPods Pro 3 – Preorder</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Air-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B0FQFH9BST/?tag=marcmendes-20\">iPhone Air MagSafe Battery</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/?tag=marcmendes-20\">Apple AirTag 4 Pack</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX532LL-A-AirTag/dp/B0CWXNS552/?tag=marcmendes-20\">Apple AirTag</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Charging-Durable-Tangle-Free-Compatible/dp/B0F1W7B5R1?tag=marcmendes-20\">Beats USB-C to USB-C Woven Short Cable</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0F6T6N2B1?tag=marcmendes-20\">Wireless CarPlay adapter</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p><i>FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.</i> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/about/#affiliate\">More.</a></p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3VLdfqA\">\n        <graphic class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1019889\" src=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/09-04-iPhone-17-Series-Grip-Banner-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"205\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/09-04-iPhone-17-Series-Grip-Banner-1.png\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/\">our homepage</a>for all the latest news, and follow 9to5Mac on</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/feature/exclusive/\">exclusive stories</a>,</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/guides/review/\">reviews</a>,</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/guides/how-to/\">how-tos</a>, and</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/9to5mac\">subscribe to our YouTube channel</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/18/iphone-air-magsafe-battery-teardown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

A day when your iPhone usage is more or less normal, but for some reason your battery’s draining at an accelerated rate? Let’s exclude <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/15/apple-explains-why-ios-26-could-affect-your-iphones-battery-life/\">the initial drain</a> after installing an update like iOS 26.</p>\n    <p>Force-quitting a bunch of apps might be your solution. Or perhaps visiting the Battery screen inside Settings to see what’s happening.</p>\n    <p>Though the Settings app has always offered a host of data about battery usage, I’ve never found it all that helpful for solving excess drain.</p>\n    <p>But in iOS 26, that’s changed. Apple has added a variety of battery-related features in the update (such as the new <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/15/your-iphone-battery-can-last-longer-with-this-new-ios-26-feature/\">AI-powered battery mode</a>). Among those changes is a revamped battery settings screen.</p>\n    <p>When an iPhone battery is draining faster than usual, iOS 26’s Settings app now explicitly highlights the excess drain, and offers suggestions for what could be causing the issue.</p>\n    <p>As seen in the images above and below, there’s a graph comparing your battery drain to normal usage. Apps and system activity with especially unusual drain are highlighted.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/08/battery-ios-26.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all\"/>\n    <p>In prior iOS releases, you would need to sort through a long list of usage data to try identifying problem apps.</p>\n    <p>But with iOS 26, apps with unusually high drain get a special orange design that alerts you to potential issues.</p>\n    <p>This orange highlight isn’t just based on total drain either. Rather, it denotes apps that appear to be using more power than they should.</p>\n    <p>For example, one night my Weather app was highlighted orange for draining 4% of battery. This is because I had very minimal on-screen and background usage. Instagram, meanwhile, spent 6% of my battery but wasn’t marked orange because my usage justified that amount.</p>\n    <p>This iOS 26 feature is ultimately a small change, but I’ve found it can make a big difference in stopping my iPhone battery from draining too fast.</p>\n    <p>Have you found iOS 26’s new battery menu in Settings helpful? How would you want Apple to improve it further?

The writer and director of 2022's Barbarian and this year's Weapons now has two solid horror hits under his belt, and is in pre-production on his next one: a Resident Evil movie planned for 2026.</p>\n    <p>That's good news for Resident Evil fans who might otherwise be a bit wary about yet another new Resi movie—the film franchise was already rebooted once, just four years ago, with the thoroughly mid Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City. Cregger's track record, though based on a small sample size (at least when it comes to feature films) is a good reason to be optimistic.</p>\n    <p>And for those wondering which game and characters this new Resi movie will be based on, it looks like the answer is: none of them.</p>\n    <p>Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Cregger confirmed that while the 2026 film will take place in the Resident Evil universe, \"It's an entirely original story,\" instead of being based on any one specific game. Cregger is also steering away from major Resident Evil characters like Leon S. Kennedy.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous,\" Cregger told <a href=\"https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968\">EW</a>. \"But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?\"</p>\n    <p>I think I know what he means. When using a character people are already familiar with, like say Master Chief in the recent Halo TV series, you run the risk of disappointing people who have expectations of that character, like <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/master-chief-had-sex/\">when you show his naked butt, or when he has sex</a>. A safer and more creative approach is to handle it like the Fallout series, which creates mostly original characters and sets them loose in a familiar world.</p>\n    <p>Both Barbarian and Weapons are effective not just because they're scary, but because they're intriguing. By presenting the story of both films from the perspective of different characters and jumping around in time, we don't get all the information in a linear fashion, which gives both movies a fun sense of mystery. At other times we get information before certain characters do, too, and then we're left dreading the horrible things we know are coming their way.</p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <p>I'm curious if and how Cregger will use similar methods in his Resident Evil movie.</p>\n    <p>\"I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing,\" Cregger said. \"I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later.\"</p>\n    <p>Cregger's Resident Evil movie is scheduled to be released, wow, exactly one year from today, on September 18, 2026. Confirmed in the cast is Austin Abrams, who played the role of James, the drug-addict, in Weapons, and Paul Walter Hauser, who played Ed in this year's The Naked Gun and Mole Man in The Fantastic Four: First Steps.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-everything-we-know/\"> Silksong guide</a>: Home of all our bug-battling tips</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-fleas-locations/\">: Gather the lost fleas</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Silksong flea locations</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/silksong-moorwing-boss-cheese-skip/\">: How to cheese or beat it</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>How to beat Moorwing</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/\">: Yes there is one</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Hunter's March bench</strong>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-simple-key-locations/\">: Where to use the costly key</a>\n    </p>\n    <strong>Silksong simple key</strong>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NirKmSpTMDo2c6wd2HKMv5.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Livingston\"/>\n    <p>Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs. He's also a fan of offbeat simulation games, mods, and ignoring storylines in RPGs so he can make up his own.</p>\n    <p>You must confirm your public display name before commenting</p>\n    <p>Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/weapons-director-says-his-resident-evil-movie-will-leave-everything-intact-from-the-games-im-not-gonna-steal-leon-and-put-him-in-an-original-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The latest development in the Pocketpair proceedings might be Nintendo's worst look yet, because the company has reportedly decided that modders' ideas don't count. Cool!</p>\n    <p>Thanks to the efforts of a Tokyo contributor who was able to review the case file for the ongoing Pocketpair lawsuit, videogame patent law site <a href=\"https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/\">Games Fray</a> (which <a href=\"https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/\">broke</a> last week's Nintendo patent story) reports that part of Pocketpair's defense against Nintendo's lawsuit aims to invalidate Nintendo's patent claims based on the existence of prior art in mods.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNWjDmt6zVnzcHNsYzcmei.png\" alt=\"An image of Pikachu looking despondently at Ash Ketchum as he is made to hold a pickaxe and mine for profit in a Palworld mod.\"/></p>\n    <p>As <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/a-videogame-patent-lawyer-breaks-down-nintendos-risky-palworld-lawsuit-it-definitely-feels-like-a-punishment/\">IP attorney Kirk Sigmon told PC Gamer</a> last September, demonstrable prior art—meaning preexisting work resembling the invention described in a patent's claims—is bad news for patent holders, because it means they shouldn't have been granted the patent in the first place. Sigmon said that courts in Japan have a strong history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants who could present examples of prior art.</p>\n    <p>By presenting mods like Pocket Souls for Dark Souls 3, which allowed the player to capture enemies in a method resembling Nintendo's <a href=\"https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2023-092953/11/en\">JP 2023-092953</a> patent claims, Pocketpair is hoping to demonstrate that Nintendo was granted a patent on ideas that had already been deployed in game design. If it's successful, it could render Nintendo's patent invalid.</p>\n    <p>According to Games Fray, however, Nintendo has argued in two separate pleadings that mods simply don't qualify as prior art, because they aren't real games.</p>\n    <p> <graphic src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qg8v9Hx9dkVQAS6pwVHaBj.jpg\" alt=\"Big Pikachu\"/></p>\n    <p>To evaluate this, let's consider the <a href=\"https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3118/en#je_ch2at1\">conditions for patentability</a> in Japanese patent law, as translated by Japan's Ministry of Justice:</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Article 29</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <i>(1) A person that invents an invention with industrial applicability may obtain a patent for that invention, unless the invention is as follows:</i>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <i>(i) an invention that is public knowledge within Japan or in a foreign country prior to the filing of the patent application;</i>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <i>(ii) an invention that is publicly known to be worked within Japan or in a foreign country prior to the filing of the patent application; or</i>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <i>(iii) an invention that is described in a distributed publication or made available for public use over telecommunications lines within Japan or in a foreign country prior to the filing of the patent application.</i>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <i>(2) A person may not obtain a patent if prior to the filing of the patent application, a person of ordinary skill in the art of the invention would have easily been able to make that invention based on an invention prescribed in one of the items of the preceding paragraph, notwithstanding the preceding paragraph.</i>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Now, I'm not an expert, but I don't see anything in there that says \"Nintendo gets a pass if it doesn't think creators of prior art deserve to have ideas.\"</p>\n    <p>It's an argument that doesn't just insult the creativity of modders—it imperils them. If Nintendo's rationale was accepted by the Tokyo District Court, it could create a world in which a developer of a \"real\" game might patent gameplay mechanics inspired by a mod and then hit that mod's creator with a cease and desist for infringing on their own ideas.</p>\n    <p>Nintendo has already demonstrated it's perfectly happy to hammer modders with legal action, having previously issued DMCA notices that <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/garrys-mod-is-removing-20-years-worth-of-nintendo-related-items-from-its-steam-workshop-following-takedown-request-its-nintendo-need-more-be-said/\">drove Garry's Mod to remove Nintendo-related items</a> from Steam Workshop and forced <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/aggressive-nintendo-copyright-claims-on-youtube-push-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-modders-into-taking-down-mod/\">Breath of Wild multiplayer modders to shut down development</a>.</p>\n    <p>In a just world—which, considering Nintendo's legal oeuvre, we probably shouldn't take as a given—it's a ploy that wouldn't stand.

the Spider-Verse 6-Pack</a>       </h2>\n<h3>                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW55GZJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">$30</a>         </h3>\n<p>Since we're talking about Spider-Verse here, the set has a few of the zanier Spider-Men from the multiverse, including Werewolf Spider-Man., Spider-Punk, and Sun-Spider.</p>\n<p>Many of the Spider-Verse minifigures come with accessories. For instance, Spider-Punk has an electric guitar; Web-slinger, otherwise known as Patrick O'Hara, actually comes with a horse figure; and Pavitr Prabhakar's minifigure is accompanied by a cat figure that is reminiscent of Bodega Cat from Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Perhaps most notably, Peter B. Parker has a baby carrier that holds a <i>mini-minifigure</i> of his daughter Mayday.</p>\n<p>All 12 minifigures come with a display stand for the character and any included accessories.</p>\n<p>Here's the full list of minifigures in the Spider-Verse collection:</p>\n<ul><li>Miles Morales (Spider-Man)</li><li>Prowler (Miles G. Morales)</li><li>Peter B. Parker (Old Spider-Man)</li><li>Gwen Stacy (Ghost Spider)</li><li>Spider-Punk (Hobart Brown)</li><li>Sun-Spider (Charlotte Webber)</li><li>Werewolf Spider-Man (Peter Parker)</li><li>Spider-Byte (Margo Kess)</li><li>Web-Slinger (Miguel O'Hara)</li><li>Patrick O'Hara (Web-slinger)</li><li>Cyborg Spider-Woman (Petra Parker)</li><li>Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man)</li></ul>\n<p>It's not impossible to receive a duplicate in these minifigure mystery boxes, but it is unlikely. What is likely, however, is that you'll need to purchase more than two boxes to get all 12 characters in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse collection. Unless you're quite lucky.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541479-lego-figs-1.jpg\"><graphic alt=\"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Lego Minifigures\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541479-lego-figs-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541479-lego-figs-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4541479-lego-figs-1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"/></a></p>\n<h3>More Lego Minifigure Collections</h3>\n<p>Lego has released some pretty cool minifigure collections over the past year, including a Dungeon &amp; Dragons set. Unfortunately, that set has been discontinued--minifigure collections are retired much faster than regular sets--but you can buy a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-6471415-TBD-Minifigures-66765/dp/B0CV2HV7WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 6-pack for $44 (with shipping)</a> from a third-party reseller on Amazon. Earlier this year, Lego launched a collection of 12 miniature F1 race cars; this series is still available, and you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ1CGPKN?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">get a 6-pack for only $20 (was $30)</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Lego Minifigure Mystery 6-Packs</strong></p>\n<ul><li><strong>Lego F1 Collectible Race Cars</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-6471415-TBD-Minifigures-66765/dp/B0CV2HV7WJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego Dungeons &amp; Dragons Minifigures</a>-- $44 |<i>Retired</i></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minifigures-Pack-Multipack-Collectible/dp/B0DJ1924PB?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego Minifigures Series 27</a>-- $40 |<i>Retired</i></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minifigures-Mystery-Surprise-Collectible/dp/B0CGY2BXLR?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego Minifigures Series 25</a>-- $40 |<i>Retired</i></li></ul>\n<p/><p/><p><strong>Single Lego Minifigures</strong></p>\n<p>We've included a brief list of Marvel and Spider-Man mystery minifigures and polybags you can still find on Amazon for reasonable prices. All of the products in the list below are no longer manufactured.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Man-Polybag-30443/dp/B09QTVFWLP?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Spider-Man: No Way Home - Bridge Battle Polybag Set</a>-- $14</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-30652-Stranges-Interdimensional-polybag/dp/B0BVJ17FMJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Doctor Strange's Interdimensional Portal Polybag</a>-- $8.45</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-71039-Characters-Wolverine-She-Hulk/dp/B0BV7D92RH?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Marvel Series 2 Minifigure</a>-- $9.49 |<i>Retired</i></li></ul>\n<h2>                    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Verse-Morales-Building/dp/B0DJ1B33B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - Miles Morales vs. The Spot</a>       </h2>\n<h3>                      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Verse-Morales-Building/dp/B0DJ1B33B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">$40 (was $50) | 375 Pieces</a>         </h3>\n<p>Multiple Across the Spider-Verse characters were previously featured as minifigures in the Miles Morales vs. the Spot Lego playset. Based on the scene from Across the Spider-Verse, this 325-piece set comes with four characters: Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy, The Spot, and Officer Jefferson. You also get to build Officer Jefferson's police cruiser and the corner deli. You can get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Verse-Morales-Building/dp/B0DJ1B33B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">this Lego Spider-Verse playset for $40 (was $50) at Amazon</a>.</p>\n<p>A cheap way to get two Spider-Man minifigures is with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Spider-Mans-Amazing-Friends-Buildable/dp/B0BLJ521L9?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Spider-Man's Car and Doc Ock playset</a>. Technically this 48-piece set is for preschoolers, but it comes with Spidey and Doc Ock minifigures and is only $9 (was $10). Another popular, budget-friendly playset is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Man-Venom-Muscle/dp/B0DJ18FYGB?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego's Spider-Man vs. Venom Muscle Car</a>. This 254-piece set is only $24 (was $30) and includes Spider-Man, Venom, and Spider-Woman minifigures.</p>\n<p>Spider-Man minifigure collectors may also be interested in Lego's larger, articulated action figures, such as this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Marvel-Spider-Man-Anti-Venom-Building/dp/B0DJ1B7RWD?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Spider-Man Mech that's on sale for only $9.49 (was $15)</a>. The Spider-Man Mech set includes an Anti-Venom minifigure and multiple accessories. Speaking of Venom, he also has his own buildable Lego mech that comes with a Miles Morales minifigure. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Morales-Posable-Building-Minifigures/dp/B0CGY3R2YT?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">Lego Venom Mech</a> is available for $12.50 (was $15).</p>\n<p>Two of Lego's Spider-Man Construction Figures are available for discounts at Amazon. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Spider-Man-Construction-Posable-Buildable/dp/B0CPQ4SYX6?tag=gamespot-promos-20\">303-piece Iron Spider-Man Construction Figure is only $24 (was $30)</a>.

That's (pretty) great news. You could even say that's precisely the kind of fun news you will find in GameSpot's new weekly deals newsletter every Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Wait, you're saying the GameSpot Deals newsletter is about Blu-rays? </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>That's the fun thing about GameSpot's commerce editorial section: We cover a wide variety of product categories across gaming, tech, and entertainment. While gaming is our main focus--with this week's newsletter centered solely on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/\">the latest Nintendo Direct</a>, because wow, that was <i>a lot</i>--our small group of passionate editors and writers also extensively cover Blu-rays, Lego sets, graphic novels and manga, sci-fi and fantasy novels, trading card games, collectibles, general tech (the fun kind!), and more.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4570868-gamespotdealsthumbnailoverlayex.jpg\">\n        <graphic alt=\"GameSpot Deals Newsletter\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4570868-gamespotdealsthumbnailoverlayex.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4570868-gamespotdealsthumbnailoverlayex.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1595/15950357/4570868-gamespotdealsthumbnailoverlayex.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4570868-gamespotdealsthumbnailoverlayex.jpg\" alt=\"GameSpot Deals Newsletter\"/>\n    <p/>\n    <p>\n      <i>Is the newsletter written by a human?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>This is a good question, all things considered. I can indeed confirm that I am a human. As GameSpot's lead commerce editor, I handpick the products we cover on a day-to-day basis. All of the deals we cover on the site are vetted by myself or Brendan Hesse, GameSpot's associate commerce editor. We publish dozens of stories each week, and our newsletter pulls directly from our recent coverage.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Is this newsletter going to take as long to read as this article?</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>Absolutely not! In fact, our newsletter is designed to take up barely any of your time. Each week, you'll find one paragraph written by me, along with links to notable GameSpot stories you can read if interested. We also link directly to a few products featured in the stories. You'll often find Amazon and Walmart affiliate links--we earn a commission on products purchased from our links--as well as links to GameSpot sister site Fanatical, an online retailer specializing in PC game deals.</p>\n    <p>If you enjoy the newsletter, we'd humbly suggest <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/deals/\">bookmarking the deals section on GameSpot's site</a>.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p><strong>Eridium</strong> is a rare material in the world of <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/game/borderlands-4/443248/\"> Borderlands 4</a> that you use as currency to pay for specific services. Since you won’t find lots of Eridium just waiting for you or an infinite farm location, you need to be mindful of how you use it. There are, however, some activities that always reward you with a small amount of it, making it possible to consistently earn more Eridium.</p>\n    <p>Below, we explain <strong>how to use Eridium in </strong><strong> Borderlands 4</strong> as well as how to get more.</p>\n    <h2>How to use Eridium in Borderlands 4</h2>\n    <p>There are three ways to use Eridium in <i>Borderlands 4</i>:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Weekly Moxxi’s Big Encore</strong></li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Respeccing Specialization points</strong></li>\n      <li>\n                                        <strong>Firmware transfer</strong></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Weekly Moxxi’s Big Encore</h3>\n    <p>In <i>Borderlands 4</i>, you can redo a boss fight by paying a certain amount of money at Moxxi’s Big Encore machine, which is always outside of the boss' arena. Once a week, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-weekly-reset-time-challenges-when-bl4/\">weekly challenges</a>, you can face a stronger version of a selected boss, but, instead of paying cash, you need to pay <strong>100 Eridium to redo the fight</strong>.</p>\n    <p>Going after the buffed version of a boss is a good strategy when looking for legendary gear and guns. To know which boss is the weekly Moxxi’s Big Encore, you can check the map menu in the bottom left corner or look for a red boss icon on the map.</p>\n    <h3>Respeccing Specialization points</h3>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-specialization-skills-trees/\">Specialization</a> is a system that only becomes available to you after completing the campaign once. It gives you access to different skill trees and passive abilities that are extremely useful when preparing your character’s build for the endgame. You can refund your Specialization points by paying 5,000 Eridium at a respec machine.</p>\n    <p>Don’t forget that <strong>you need to pay this amount every time you use the machine</strong>. Respeccing your Specialization points is <i>very</i> expensive, so think carefully before you spend your Eridium.</p>\n    <h3>Firmware transfer</h3>\n    <p>Firmwares are special bonuses that can spawn on repkits, ordnance, class mods, shields, and enhancements. However, as your gear has a chance to come with a random firmware, you can utilize the transfer machine to swap the firmware on your gear to another firmware that you own on a different piece of gear.</p>\n    <p>We tested transferring firmware from one ordnance to another and from one class mod to another. In both cases, although the cost in cash changes depending on the items you’re transferring firmwares from, the process always <strong>charges 80 Eridium</strong>.</p>\n    <h2>How to get Eridium in Borderlands 4</h2>\n    <p>If you want to get more Eridium, the simplest method is to play the game. You can earn Eridium from several sources, from missions to killing regular enemies. While the latter is completely random, the former is the best option when trying to regularly farm Eridium.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Borderlands 4</i>, there are many types of missions. You receive Eridium from<strong> campaign quests, side missions, challenges, and contracts (bounties and patrols).</strong> Among these, the <strong>contracts are the fastest method to get more Eridium</strong> since finding a bounty target is simple, and you can repeat them.</p>\n    <p>If you have the time and like to explore, you should focus on <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-all-fast-travel-locations-spots-safe-houses-silos-bl4/\">unlocking the Safehouses and Silos</a> (with our <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/map/borderlands-4-interactive-map-full-kairos-bl4/\">interactive map</a> open on the side). Claiming the command console will give you <strong>25 Eridium</strong>, but you can only receive this reward once per location.</p>\n    <p>Another way to gain more Eridium is by facing <strong>World Bosses</strong>. As an example, at level 38, we killed Saddleback and the Immortal Boneface and received <strong>25 Eridium</strong>.</p>\n    <p>Do you need more help with Borderlands 4?

We know that traversing the immense <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/map/borderlands-4-interactive-map-full-kairos-bl4/\">map of Kairos</a> is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-vehicle-unlock-how-to-customization-bl4/\">vehicle</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-all-fast-travel-locations-spots-safe-houses-silos-bl4/\">fast travel points</a>.

    "body": "<p><strong>Abilities</strong> are split up into two categories in <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/game/hollow-knight-silksong/503731/\"> Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> — </p>\n<p><strong>Silk Skills</strong>and</p>\n<p><strong>Ancestral Arts</strong>.</p>\n<p>Silk Skills are used in combat, while Ancestral Arts are used to traverse to new areas in Pharloom. All the abilities have specific purposes, but they all do one thing — simplify your journey in <i>Silksong</i>. However, finding and unlocking every ability can be time-consuming and difficult. To facilitate your playthrough, we've compiled the locations of every Silk Skill and Ancestral Art.Here are <strong>all the abilities in  Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> and where to find them. For extra assistance, check out our </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hollow-knight-silksong-interactive-map-full-pharloom/\">interactive map</a>to help you pinpoint all the ability locations.</p>\n<h2>All Silk Skills in Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>\n<p>Silk Skills are combat abilities that can be equipped on your crest. There are six Silk Skills in total in <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i>.</p>\n<h3>Silkspear</h3>\n<p><strong>Silkspear</strong> is located at the top of Mosshome in Bone Bottom. To reach it, take the northwestern exit of The Marrow and platform your way upwards to the next area. At the top of this room, you'll find a Weaver statue that gives you the Silkspear ability.</p>\n<p>Silkspear can be used to clear out thick silk threads that are blocking passageways, or it can be used as a ranged attack against enemies.</p>\n<h3>Thread Storm</h3>\n<p> <strong>Thread Storm</strong> is found in the top right corner of Greymoor. To unlock it, you'll need to first defeat the bird gauntlet inside the house on Craw Lake, which is on the right side of Greymoor. After you survive the gauntlet, hit the switch inside to release balloons outside. You'll need to pogo to the top right corner of Greymoor, where you'll find a Weaver statue that gives you Thread Storm.</p>\n<p>Thread Storm is great for aggressive players as it deals damage in a small area around Hornet. It isn't the best if you're facing off against a singular enemy like a boss, but it's much better when you're getting swarmed by enemies like in a gauntlet or rush battle.</p>\n<h3>Cross Stitch</h3>\n<p><strong>Cross Stitch</strong> is unlocked after you defeat Phantom in the Exhaust Organ area of Bilewater. To get to this area, you need to go through <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hollow-knight-silksong-the-mist-how-to-get-through/\">The Mist</a> from either Sinner's Road or Bilewater. Once inside, make your way through the steam-filled passageways until you find Phantom playing an organ.</p>\n<p>Cross Stitch works like a parry in other action RPGs. If you use the ability right before you're about to get hit, you'll instantly attack the enemy back and avoid taking any damage.</p>\n<h3>Sharpdart</h3>\n<p><strong>Sharpdart </strong>is locked behind a Weaver-etched door on the west side of Wormways. To get inside, you'll need to have the <strong>Needolin</strong> and <strong>Clawline </strong>as the door is too far out of reach for a regular sprint jump. Once you make it inside, continue all the way to the left to find a Weaver statue that'll give you Sharpdart.</p>\n<p>Sharpdart works like an empowered dash that damages any enemies that you pass through.</p>\n<h3>Rune Rage</h3>\n<p> <strong>Rune Rage</strong> is unlocked after you defeat the First Sinner in The Slab. Getting to the First Sinner is a lengthy process, but to start off, make sure to unlock Faydown Cloak in Mount Fay. From there, you'll need to get the Apostate's Key to open the locked door at the bottom of The Slab. You can find the key in the bottom left corner of the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hollow-knight-silksong-how-to-reach-the-putrified-ducts/\">Putrified Ducts</a> as seen in this image below:</p>\n<p>Return to The Slab and make your way through the area until you collect the Key of Indolent and the Key of Heretic. Once you have all three keys, make your way to the hallway just above the bottom right area of The Slab.</p>\n<p>Inside you'll find what seems to be a dead end, but if you look up, you'll notice a hole in the ceiling. Use Cling Grip to hold onto the sliver of the wall on the left, and double jump into the hole in the ceiling. Proceed through the tunnel to find a sealed cage. Destroy all the locks and head inside to find the First Sinner. Once defeated, you'll unlock Rune Rage.</p>\n<p>When used, Rune Rage will create multiple silk runes around you that will explode after a short amount of time and damage any enemies caught in its blasts. It's great for when you're facing off against multiple enemies at a time or one large, stagnant enemy.</p>\n<h3>Pale Nail</h3>\n<p>Pale Nail is the last Silk Skill you can find in <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i>, but you will need to make it to <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hollow-knight-silksong-act-3-requirements-silk-and-soul-how-to-start/\">Act 3</a> first. After you reach Act 3, continue through the story until you unlock the <strong>Silk Soar</strong> ability, and then retrace your steps back to where you landed in Choral Chambers. To see exactly where you should stand, check out the image below:</p>\n<p>From there, continue upward until you reach the room where you found the Architect's Melody. There is a hole in the top right corner of the room, but it can be pretty hard to pinpoint. Stand directly in front of this destroyed statue in the background, and use Silk Soar to perfectly go up the hole in the ceiling:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/hollow-knight-silksong-ability-locations-all-where-to-find/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Windows may prove a perfectly suitable platform for gaming on a traditional PC, but on handheld devices like the ROG Ally, Legion Go, or even the Steam Deck, it’s another story. Microsoft’s operating system is often too clunky and frustrating when you’re restricted to a gamepad for input. The upcoming Xbox-branded Ally from Asus, however, has promised a solution with a dedicated, controller-friendly user interface for running PC games on the go. These devices have yet to hit shelves, but a downloadable preview of a new version of Windows 11 is giving folks access to the new interface on just about any Windows handheld device.</p>\n    <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/valve-microsoft-steam-deck-steamos-xbox-pc-handhelds-1851735440\">Steam Ate Microsoft’s Lunch On PC, It’s About To Do The Same On Handhelds</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak\">As noted by  The Verge</a>, The upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 lets you launch the new gaming-focused, fullscreen Xbox app for Windows with just a few tweaks to the registry and the help of a third-party tool (</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/\">a Reddit post by user Gogsi123</a>outlines the whole process). Unlike the overlay that software companies like Asus provide for their Windows handhelds, this new Xbox app skips the entire Windows desktop environment in favor of a fullscreen, controller-friendly experience. And people are finding, by way of the preview workaround, that it seems to lead to marginal performance gains as well.</p>\n    <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751\">The Xbox Ally PC Gaming Handheld Feels Great, But At What Price?</a></p>\n    <p>While this version of the fullscreen Xbox app requires some legwork to get working, its availability across Windows handhelds undercuts one of the main appeals of the <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751\">upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>–which is <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/asus-ally-x-review-steam-deck-sd-card-battery-windows-1851600340\">distinctly different from Asus’ ROG Ally X</a>–which is expected to arrive on October 16, 2025.</p>\n    <h2>The ROG Xbox Ally X is less than a month away, and we’re still not sure of pricing</h2>\n    <p>Though the best graphical experiences are still had on well-kitted PCs and cutting-edge consoles, we are in the midst of a handheld arms race kicked off by Valve three years ago when it launched the Steam Deck. Since then, other PC manufacturers have jumped in with Windows-based options. More recently, <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465\">the power of the Switch 2</a> has made it something of a competitor in this space as well.</p>\n    <p>It’s all the stranger, then, that we’re not actually sure exactly how much Microsoft and Asus’ collaboration is going to cost. According to a <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-retailer-leak-suggests-surprising-price-point\">report from former  IGN writer Destin Legarie</a>, a local Best Buy indicated that a $549 version and an $899 one would be available when he called to ask about it. If this is accurate, that puts the lower-tier version of the Xbox Ally at the same price as the smaller-capacity Steam Deck OLED, and within competitive pricing range of the current ROG Ally and Ally X, which retail for about $649 and $899, respectively.</p>\n    <p>Having enjoyed my time with the ROG Ally X, I can definitely attest to the value of having more games available on a handheld that’s running Windows instead of Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, though I typically prefer the form factor and controller-focused interface of the Steam Deck. Now, if a few tweaks to the Windows registry can also give people that experience on a non-Xbox Ally X, I imagine it’ll be harder to find a use case for the Xbox Ally for those who already own a handheld gaming device and aren’t afraid to tinker with their machines.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-x-windows-handheld-app-leak-2000626934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The answer was yes, and there’s a good reason why.</p><p>During a Zoom interview with DICE producer Jeremy Chubb and design director Shashank Uchil, we talked about all the work that goes into making a big<a href=\"https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487\">  Battlefield</a> map and how much effort they put into remaking the iconic and beloved Operation Firestorm map, which will be available in </p><p><i>BF6</i>at launch. But, when our conversation veered into talking about how to balance maps that can blow up in all kinds of ways, I had to ask if they had a tool or button that lets them destroy everything in one click. So I asked and got a blunt answer:</p><p>“Yeah,” said Chubb. I then asked if it was fun to hit that button, and both Chubb and Uchil replied, with laughter in their voices, that yes, it was indeed fun to hit that big button.</p><p>“It is fun!” Chubb told <i>Kotaku</i> while laughing more. “It usually causes some big meltdowns in teams working on performance because we designed the maps not to be instantly triggered, like every instance of destruction [all at once]. And [the button was pressed] a few times, and there were some raised eyebrows about what we were doing for sure.” </p><p>When I mentioned that EA should release GIFs of the maps completely blowing up after hitting that button, Uchil said that was a “good idea.” So you’re welcome, EA marketing team.</p><h2>The reason for <i>BF6</i>‘s big red button</h2> <p>You might be wondering why there’s a button in Frostbite, the engine <i>BF6</i> is built on, that lets you blow up an entire map instantly. The answer is so that the team can easily playtest the map in its most destroyed state to make sure it’s still fun and balanced.</p><p>“So…think of the map as [having] three different states, right,” explained Uchil. “The map starts out in a pristine state, or however it is meant to be at the beginning. And then, as the map progresses, it gets more and more destroyed. And towards the end, if everybody’s using a rocket launcher or C4, you hit peak destruction. And like I said, the game has to be good in all three phases, the pristine phase, the in-between phase, and the final phase.”</p><p>According to Uchil, the “big red button” is the best tool for quickly testing that final phase of each map.</p><p>“You can see what is the worst-case scenario,” said Uchil. “Is there enough cover? Do we need to add some more things? Do we need to bring some more assets so in the final stage, it’s still fun to play? So yeah, that’s why we have the big button.”</p><p>At this point, I was fully distracted by the idea of the button, and asked if anyone had ever pressed it by accident. That doesn’t seem to have happened, and because the maps weren’t built to instantly explode, it could lead to problems if it did.</p><p>“I mean, we have times when you can crash a bunch of things,” said Uchil. “The destruction is meant to happen in parts.

For those new to the terminology, panning the camera moves it horizontally (left and right), allowing it to cover a wide area without needing to be physically repositioned. Tilt allows the camera to move vertically (up and down), which helps in adjusting the angle of view. Meanwhile, zooming allows the camera to magnify the image, which the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-Streaming-Dual-Camera-Whiteboard-Livestreamers/dp/B06X99NFRS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F3AC92J6DJED&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Tyn3eG6xvJBJXrSAM5IIWlfavKaKbJ-rEi9loQnW2JH5ds3Vo3BqBWMLRHyPLB2nzwsvu56-9eTFTmLlqMixGmmF1OsQOMQ73MjdMJhNV2u23Bzq8Eb-LUJb8w8l0pyY6XCp3yVnCkZq0MZygMk1Mg.Q8ZyuT3e12So8Ph-c1lLKOBIBVg1_2gsjreln0KVAe4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=emeet%2Bpixy&amp;qid=1755715752&amp;sprefix=emeet%2Bpixy%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=fstoppers-20\">PIXY</a> achieves digitally.</p>\n<p>These features transform a webcam into a highly versatile recording tool. This is especially useful for both live streaming and pre-recorded video for a wide range of purposes.</p>\n<h2>Unboxing and Setup: Simple and Flexible</h2>\n<p>The PIXY arrives in a compact box with the camera unit, a detachable Z-bracket mount, a USB-C cable with a Type-C to Type-A adapter included, a quick-start guide, manual, and warranty pamphlet. At 120 g and 56x43x22 mm, its cute, Pixar-esque design with a subtle LED ring feels modern and sturdy. Positioning the webcam takes seconds. I mounted the PIXY on top of my MacBook Pro via the included mount, which offers more versatility than fixed mounts—suitable for monitor tops, tripods, tabletops, or inverted setups.</p>\n<p>After downloading EMEET Studio software (compatible with Windows 10/11 and macOS 10.14+), I connected via USB-C, and the camera was recognized instantly. The software allows users to define their desired resolution (up to 4K at 30 fps), ISO, brightness, contrast, and white balance, offering camera-like control.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2025/08/20/emeet_pixy_03.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>Design and Performance: PTZ Meets AI Innovation</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-Streaming-Dual-Camera-Whiteboard-Livestreamers/dp/B06X99NFRS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F3AC92J6DJED&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Tyn3eG6xvJBJXrSAM5IIWlfavKaKbJ-rEi9loQnW2JH5ds3Vo3BqBWMLRHyPLB2nzwsvu56-9eTFTmLlqMixGmmF1OsQOMQ73MjdMJhNV2u23Bzq8Eb-LUJb8w8l0pyY6XCp3yVnCkZq0MZygMk1Mg.Q8ZyuT3e12So8Ph-c1lLKOBIBVg1_2gsjreln0KVAe4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=emeet%2Bpixy&amp;qid=1755715752&amp;sprefix=emeet%2Bpixy%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=fstoppers-20\">PIXY’s</a> dual-camera system consists of a 4K primary camera with a Sony 1/2.55\" sensor and an AI-assisted secondary camera, which powers the tracking and AI features. BlinkFocus autofocus locks onto subjects in 0.2 seconds, 2.5 times faster than the industry average, outperforming competitors in speed and accuracy. The 73° field of view suits desk setups without distortion, along with smooth motion.</p>\n<p>PTZ functionality is a real highlight. Its motorized base silently pans 310° and tilts 180°, controlled via EMEET Studio or gesture-based tracking (raise your palm to toggle, shown by a blue LED). It tracks subjects up to 6 meters, which is perfect for dynamic presentations such as lighting or shooting demonstrations. Privacy mode adds some peace of mind: manually tilt the camera down 79°, or set auto-timeouts (10 s, 1 min, 15 min) to idle. Some users may prefer to disconnect the camera when not in use due to privacy considerations, as you might do with any other camera.</p>\n<p>Audio comes via a built-in three-mic array with AI presets: Live Mode for general noise suppression, Noise-Canceling for busy settings, and Original Sound for clean recordings. In a noisy environment with fans, Noise-Canceling isolated my voice effectively when tested in a busy office, removing the need for dedicated mics for presentations. The software supports Zoom, OBS, YouTube, and more, while integrated AI can access ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Gemini to offer storyboarding, prompts, or anything else that might streamline content planning.</p>\n<p>The PIXY’s 4K video, enhanced by AI-driven dual-camera tuning, delivers sharp, vibrant footage with natural skin tones and balanced highlights, even in backlit conditions. Compared to my MacBook Pro’s webcam, it’s a massive upgrade that looks crisp and professional, especially when combined with flattering lighting. It doesn’t match high-end mirrorless cameras’ dynamic range, clipping highlights in harsh light due to its smaller sensor, but it far surpasses budget webcams. EMEET Studio’s manual adjustments for exposure and color provide fine-tuned control, with options to change the ISO—not just the usual brightness and contrast settings.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2025/08/20/emeetstudio.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>Real-World Use: Elevating Lectures and Content</h2>\n<p>For online lectures, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-Streaming-Dual-Camera-Whiteboard-Livestreamers/dp/B06X99NFRS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F3AC92J6DJED&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Tyn3eG6xvJBJXrSAM5IIWlfavKaKbJ-rEi9loQnW2JH5ds3Vo3BqBWMLRHyPLB2nzwsvu56-9eTFTmLlqMixGmmF1OsQOMQ73MjdMJhNV2u23Bzq8Eb-LUJb8w8l0pyY6XCp3yVnCkZq0MZygMk1Mg.Q8ZyuT3e12So8Ph-c1lLKOBIBVg1_2gsjreln0KVAe4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=emeet%2Bpixy&amp;qid=1755715752&amp;sprefix=emeet%2Bpixy%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=fstoppers-20\">PIXY</a> transforms delivery. Its PTZ tracking let me move freely while demonstrating setups, unlike static webcams or my iPhone 15 Pro Max, which, while high-quality, ties up my phone for notes or research during meetings, which I usually like to have on hand. Whiteboard Mode is especially useful for making diagrams and text clear for students, and preset PTZ positions simplify switching between board and desk. EMEET seems to have thought of everything with this webcam.</p>\n<p>The price point of<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EMEET-Streaming-Dual-Camera-Whiteboard-Livestreamers/dp/B06X99NFRS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3F3AC92J6DJED&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Tyn3eG6xvJBJXrSAM5IIWlfavKaKbJ-rEi9loQnW2JH5ds3Vo3BqBWMLRHyPLB2nzwsvu56-9eTFTmLlqMixGmmF1OsQOMQ73MjdMJhNV2u23Bzq8Eb-LUJb8w8l0pyY6XCp3yVnCkZq0MZygMk1Mg.Q8ZyuT3e12So8Ph-c1lLKOBIBVg1_2gsjreln0KVAe4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=emeet%2Bpixy&amp;qid=1755715752&amp;sprefix=emeet%2Bpixy%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=fstoppers-20\"> $159.99</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=emeet+pixy&amp;crid=29AW1GXEYGCB8&amp;sprefix=emeet+pixy%2Caps%2C102&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1\">£149.99</a> makes the PIXY an excellent option for content creators who deliver to camera, elevating their game at a price that feels low in comparison to the benefits it brings. For vlogs, its tracking adds dynamic pans, enhancing engagement with the camera without help from a second person in control. The AI scriptwriting tool can save prep time or prompt users with bullet-pointed information for their delivery.</p>\n<p>Compared to static webcams, its 4K clarity elevates production value, ideal for YouTube or TikTok. In virtual meetings, the PIXY’s sharp video and noise-canceling audio ensure professional communication, keeping users framed even when standing.</p>\n<p>\n      <graphic src=\"https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2025/08/20/emeetstudio1.jpg\"/>\n    </p>\n<h2>What I Liked</h2>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t<p>The PTZ capabilities have transformed my online meetings.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t<p>4K video with AI enhancement, far better than laptop webcams.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t<p>Versatile audio presets with strong noise cancellation.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t<p>Multiple exposure control methods, including ISO adjustment.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t<p>Video recording feature, making this ideal for creating content for YouTube and TikTok.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n<h2>What Could Be Improved</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://fstoppers.com/reviews/review-emeets-dual-camera-ptz-webcam-meet-pixy-709614?utm_source=FS_RSS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=Main_RSS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Smart objects change how you build composites and graphics in Photoshop in a way that actually saves time. You keep sharp detail when you resize, you get flexible filters, and you can update an asset without rebuilding the whole file.</p>\n    <p>Coming to you from Aaron Nace of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@phlearn\">Phlearn</a>, this practical video walks through what a smart object really is and how to use it without guesswork. You see why scaling a normal layer down and back up trashes detail while a smart object stays clean. You watch the same Gaussian blur act as a “smart filter” you can toggle, edit, or delete later instead of baking it in. You learn how a smart object behaves like a mini document that references the original file, which means you can push transforms and effects while the source stays pristine. This matters the moment you start moving elements around a layout or comp where revisions are the rule, not the exception.</p>\n    <p>The tutorial then shifts to a simple ad mockup so you can see the workflow in context. You drop an image into a box, transform it into perspective, and mask it to the sign area with a quick selection, which is faster than trying to free-transform a raster layer into shape. You double-click the smart object to open it in its own tab, add type, and use selections to slip text behind a subject for depth that reads instantly. You save and watch the main composition update while keeping the mask and perspective, so you can iterate text size and position without redoing anything. That habit of editing the contents, saving, and seeing live updates builds speed into your process.</p>\n    <p>Replacing content is where this gets powerful. You relink the smart object to a new PSD and keep the same perspective, crop, and transparency that the comp expects. That means you can swap seasonal creative, try alternate headlines, or test colorways without touching the main file. You avoid the “start over” trap that eats hours late in a project. You also see how smart filters make nondestructive experimenting easy, since a blur or levels tweak stays editable as your taste changes.</p>\n    <p>One extra technique in the video pulls real reflections from the background and lays them over the ad for realism. You load the billboard area as a selection, duplicate that region from the background to a new layer, clip it to the ad, and set it to Screen so only the lights show. A quick levels adjustment pushes darks down and lifts mids so the reflection reads, then you ease opacity until it sits. It is subtle, and it uses the actual scene data instead of faking highlights with a brush. The video finishes with a couple of quick edits to the linked PSD so you can watch live updates take hold in the composite in seconds.</p>\n    <p>You will also see practical tips that make the workflow smoother. Lower the ad layer’s opacity while you match perspective so alignment is painless. Use a layer mask on the ad itself rather than erasing so you can refine edges after you commit a transform. Group your type and mask the group with subject selections to tuck letters behind a person without flattening anything. Save the smart object as a PSD when you add layers so you keep editability and avoid JPEG prompts that slow you down. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Nace.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://fstoppers.com/photoshop/usefulness-smart-objects-photoshop-711819?utm_source=FS_RSS&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=Main_RSS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

And in everything from choreographic gestures to weaving, one event makes patterns sing in music and materials and bodies. Across Sheffield, Berlin, Barcelona, Linz, and online, the latest <a href=\"https://2025.algorithmicpattern.org/conference/\">Alpaca Conference</a> is entering its second weekend, following an in-person festival the first weekend.</p>\n    <p>These practices connect beautifully. They give you a chance to craft patterns — thinking about dancing like code, and coding like dancing, and everything like textiles, and even physically weaving. And organizers are one of the few events using hybrid events to create greater accessibility and cross distances, while still encouraging interaction. I know first-hand; I was joining others in sharing Trisha Brown choreography over Zoom. And these virtual events got people moving and working with one another, not just zoning out with their cameras switched off.</p>\n    <p>Maybe the greatest obstacles to all of us are two-fold: finding time, and just <i>starting</i> to explore. The conference program will be online tomorrow and Saturday again, plus there are richly-illustrated papers to browse through at your leisure. You can watch from wherever you are, or even join watch parties in specific cities — removing the energy and financial cost and other barriers that arise from physical-only conferences. </p>\n    <p>It’s all a chance to tickle your brain and get smarter — partly through moving around and physically manipulating things. Thing about it as natural intelligence augmentation, rather than artificial. Here’s what the organizers pointedly offer:</p>\n    <blockquote><p>Despite the inclusion of contemporary digital arts, our focus will be fully on hands-on, human creativity and</p><i>not</i>artificial intelligence.<p>The event will showcase work across disciplines, featuring diverse talks, workshops, and performances exploring how we can explore beyond our imaginations through pattern-making.</p></blockquote>\n    <p>To give you a sense of this, here are some selected images:</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-scaled.jpeg\">\n        <graphic fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-724x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-152355\" srcset=\"https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-724x1024.jpeg 724w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-768x1086.jpeg 768w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-1086x1536.jpeg 1086w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-1448x2048.jpeg 1448w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-212x300.jpeg 212w, https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-scaled.jpeg 1810w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdm.link/app/uploads/2025/09/multiweave-724x1024.jpeg\"/>\n    <p><a href=\"https://2025.algorithmicpattern.org/proceedings/SVNK8R/paper.html\">MultiWeave.

    "body": "<p>Ex-staffers testify that RFK Jr. is turning away from science, with potentially dire consequences.</p>\n<p>This week has been an eventful one for America’s public health agency. Two former leaders of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25vDjs0iy_k\">explained the reasons for their sudden departures from the agency</a> in a Senate hearing. And they described how CDC employees are being instructed to turn their backs on scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>The CDC’s former director Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Debra Houry took questions from a Senate committee on Wednesday. <strong>They painted a picture of a health agency in turmoil—and at risk of harming the people it is meant to serve.</strong></p>\n<p>On Thursday, an advisory CDC panel that develops vaccine guidance met for a two-day discussion on multiple childhood vaccines. During the meeting, which was underway as <i>The Checkup</i> went to press, members of the panel were set to discuss those vaccines and propose recommendations on their use.</p>\n<p>Monarez worries that access to childhood vaccines is under threat—and that the public health consequences could be dire. “If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the current secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees federal health and science agencies that include the CDC, which monitors and responds to threats to public health. Part of that role involves developing vaccine recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>As  we’ve noted before, RFK Jr. has long been a prominent critic of vaccines.</strong> He has incorrectly linked commonly used ingredients to autism and made other incorrect statements about risks associated with various vaccines.</p>\n<p>Still, he oversaw the recruitment of Monarez—who does not share those beliefs—to lead the agency. When she was sworn in on July 31, Monarez, who is a microbiologist and immunologist, had already been serving as acting director of the agency. She had held prominent positions at other federal agencies and departments too, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-secretary-kennedy-swears-in-susan-monarez-as-cdc-director-to-advance-make-america-healthy-again.html\">described her as “a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials.”</a></p>\n<p><strong>His opinion seems to have changed somewhat since then. </strong>Just 29 days after Monarez took on her position, she was turfed out of the agency. And in yesterday’s hearing, she explained why.</p>\n<p>On August 25, Kennedy asked Monarez to do two things, she said. First, he wanted her to commit to firing scientists at the agency. And second, he wanted her to “pre-commit” to approve vaccine recommendations made by the agency’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), regardless of whether there was any scientific evidence to support those recommendations, she said. “He just wanted blanket approval,” she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk\">said during her testimony</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>She refused both requests.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Monarez testified that she didn’t want to get rid of hardworking scientists who played an important role in keeping Americans safe. And she said she could not commit to approving vaccine recommendations without reviewing the scientific evidence behind them and maintain her integrity. She was sacked.</p>\n<p>Those vaccine recommendations are currently under discussion, and scientists like Monarez are worried about how they might change. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the previous committee in June. (Monarez said she was not consulted on the firings and found out about them through media reports.)</p>\n<p><strong>“A clean sweep is needed to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy wrote in  a piece for the </strong>He went on to replace those individuals with eight new members, some of whom have been prominent vaccine critics and </p>\n<p><i>Wall Street Journal</i>at the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76#xd_co_f=OGFkNmQ3ZjItZGE1Ny00ODBiLThjNjktMWM5MzUwOTMyYTA0~\">have spread misinformation about vaccines</a>. One later withdrew.</p>\n<p>That new panel met two weeks later. The <a href=\"https://news.aai.org/2025/06/30/reconstituted-cdc-acip-holds-first-meeting/\">meeting</a> included a presentation about thimerosal—a chemical that Kennedy has incorrectly linked to autism, and which is no longer included in vaccines in the US—and a proposal to recommend that the MMRV vaccine (for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) not be offered to children under the age of four.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html\">five new committee members</a> were named. They include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/08/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers/\">individuals who have advocated against vaccine mandates</a> and who have argued that mRNA-based covid vaccines should be removed from the market.</p>\n<p><strong>All 12 members are convening for a meeting that runs today and tomorrow.</strong> At that meeting, members will propose recommendations for the MMRV vaccine and vaccines for covid-19 and hepatitis B, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/final-posted-2025-09-17-508.pdf\">an agenda</a> published on the CDC website.</p>\n<p>Those are the recommendations for which Monarez says she was asked to provide “blanket approval.” “My worst fear is that I would then be in a position of approving something that reduces access [to] <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/20/1109087/childhood-vaccines-public-health-success/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=09-18-25\">lifesaving vaccines to children</a> and others who need them,” she said.</p>\n<p>That job now goes to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/30/1119449/hhs-robert-f-kennedy-jr-jim-oneill-longevity-maha/?utm_source=the_checkup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_checkup.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_content=09-18-25\">Jim O’Neill, the deputy health secretary and acting CDC director (also a longevity enthusiast)</a>, who now holds the authority to approve those recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>We don’t yet know what those recommendations will be. But if they are approved, they could reshape access to vaccines for children and vulnerable people in the US. </strong>As <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-chairs-warn-threats-immunization-science-licensure/\">six former chairs of the committee wrote for  STAT</a>: “ACIP is directly linked to the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines without cost to approximately 50% of children in the US, and the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance coverage for ACIP-recommended vaccines to approximately 150 million people in the US.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/18/1123844/meeting-vaccine-guidance-former-cdc-leaders-alarmed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Can AI create a life form? These “generative” genomes are a start</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can draw cat pictures and write emails. Now the same technology can compose a working genome.</p>\n<p>A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses—and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.</p>\n<p>The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the “the first generative design of complete genomes.”</p>\n<p>The work, described in a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675911v1\">preprint paper</a>, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an “impressive first step” toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by <i>MIT Technology Review</i>.  </p>\n<p>Boeke says the AI’s performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. “They saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,” he says.</p>\n<p>This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That’s because viruses are not alive. They’re more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes.</p>\n<p>In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria—called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters.</p>\n<p>To do so, they used two versions of an <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/generative-ai-tool-marks-a-milestone-in-biology\">AI called Evo</a>, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses.</p>\n<p>But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with <i>E. coli</i> bacteria.</p>\n<p>That led to a profound “AI is here” moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.</p>\n<p>“That was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,” says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out.</p>\n<p>Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working—that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them.</p>\n<p>J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/08/25/200992/how-to-remake-life/\">organisms with lab-made DNA</a> nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”</p>\n<p>For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. “We did the manual AI version—combing through the literature, taking what was known,” he says.</p>\n<p>But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\">claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024</a> for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses<strong>. </strong>For instance, doctors have sometimes tried “phage therapy” to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria.</p>\n<p>“There is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,” says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei’s lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients’ bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones.</p>\n<p>The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven’t taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists—out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice—could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality.</p>\n<p>“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it’s random so you don’t know what you are getting,” says Venter. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”</p>\n<p>Whether an AI can generate a bona fide genome for a larger organism remains an open question. For instance, <i>E. coli</i> has about a thousand times more DNA code than phiX174 does. “The complexity would rocket from staggering to … way way more than the number of subatomic particles in the universe,” says Boeke.</p>\n<p>Also, there’s still no easy way to test AI designs for larger genomes. While some viruses can “boot up” from just a DNA strand, that’s not the case with a bacterium, a mammoth, or a human. Scientists would instead have to gradually change an existing cell with genetic engineering—a still laborious process.</p>\n<p>Despite that, Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, a cell-engineering company in Boston, says exactly such an effort is needed. He believes it could be carried out in “automated” laboratories where genomes get proposed and tested and the results are fed back to AI for further improvement.</p>\n<p>“This would be a nation-scale scientific milestone, as cells are the building blocks of all life,” says Kelly. “The US should make sure we get to it first.”</p>\n<h3>Deep Dive</h3>\n<h3>Biotechnology and health</h3>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/29/1120769/exclusive-record-breaking-baby-born-embryo-over-30-years-old/\">\n        <figcaption class=\"image__meta--16eb0f8dde685315ba1d77ae67c89391\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123801/ai-virus-bacteriophage-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The full-scale war has reshaped priorities for Ukraine’s tech sector. Innovative military technologies and advanced defence solutions are not only essential for the country’s security — they’re also among the most promising vectors for business growth. Ukrainian defence tech is tested directly on the battlefield, under the most challenging conditions. These circumstances allow products to prove their effectiveness, attracting interest from international partners, investors, and allied countries looking to strengthen their own defence capabilities.</p>\n    <p>From my position at the heart of Ukraine’s tech ecosystem, I’ve seen how quickly the sector has shifted towards defence — and how global attention is now focusing on our innovations.</p>\n    <p>The need to counter large-scale Russian aggression has sparked a technological boom in the defence tech sphere. Hundreds of young startups have emerged, attracting attention from both Ukrainian and international investors. <a href=\"https://ain.ua/2024/08/23/armiia-rosiyi-ce-potuznii-texnologicnii-protivnik-mixailo-fedorov-pro-ukrayinskii-defense-tech-brave1-ta-robotizaciiu-viini/\">Over 30 countries</a> have already expressed interest in Ukrainian defence innovations, signalling strong export potential for homegrown technologies.</p>\n    <p>Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine’s <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/topic/drone\">drone</a> industry has transformed from small volunteer initiatives into a structured and competitive sector. According to a report by <a href=\"https://res2.weblium.site/res/65649c2d2ea0b1000f9d831b/686fcf5df528f99b373e6aed\">DataDriven</a>, drone production surged from 5,000 units in 2022 to 4,000,000 by the end of 2024 — an 800-fold increase. Today, the country has over 500 active drone manufacturers and more than 1,000 drone models, with 80% of the FPV drone segment controlled by four companies. Investments in the drone industry in 2024 exceeded $60mn, with seed rounds typically ranging from $1mn to $3mn.</p>\n    <p>Since launching in March 2023, the state defence technology cluster <a href=\"https://brave1.gov.ua/en/\">Brave1</a> has registered over 4,600 innovations from more than 2,100 developers. Its members work on strike systems, UAVs, ammunition, and advanced solutions for reconnaissance, cybersecurity, and demining. The cluster has issued more than 600 grants totalling over $52.4mn, effectively acting as the largest “angel investor” for Ukrainian defence innovations. Technologies developed with Brave1 support, such as trench electronic warfare systems, interceptor drones, and logistical unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), are already changing the course of the war. Brave1 also facilitates NATO-standard codification, battlefield testing, and integration into the Armed Forces.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://kse.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/241004-Brave1-report-v.1.pdf\">Research</a> by the Kyiv School of Economics and Brave1 shows that investments in Ukraine’s defence tech sector grew from $5mn in 2023 to $50mn in 2024, with the average investment size rising from $500,000 to $1-3mn. The sector’s profit margin is 25%, the highest globally — compared with 17% in NATO countries and 15% in the EU — underscoring the economic attractiveness of Ukrainian defence tech.</p>\n    <p>Ukraine’s rapid rise as a global defence tech powerhouse is not happening in isolation. Key innovations and successful startups need platforms to showcase their solutions, connect with investors, and scale globally. That’s where <a href=\"https://itarena.ua/\">IT Arena</a> in Lviv — Ukraine’s largest tech event — plays a crucial role.</p>\n    <p>This year, IT Arena will run from September 26 to 28, gathering over 6,000 participants from 30 countries.  At the heart of the event is the <a href=\"https://itarena.ua/startup-competition/\">Startup Competition</a>, the country’s flagship startup battle and the central stage for cutting-edge innovation — including in defence tech. Many of the defence solutions showcased at the event emerged during the full-scale war, as Ukrainian innovators responded to urgent battlefield needs. Recognising their significance, IT Arena introduced a dedicated defence tech category, giving <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/topic/startups\">startups</a> a platform to present their projects, attract funding, and scale globally.</p>\n    <p>Contestants get a unique chance to connect with venture capital firms, business angels, and global investors — and bring Ukraine’s battlefield-tested solutions to international markets.</p>\n    <p>For the third consecutive year, the 2025 Startup Competition participants will compete in two categories: general and defence, the latter focused on defence tech and cybersecurity. Defence tech remains the most competitive category, with 52 applications submitted, reflecting the growing importance of Ukraine’s security-driven innovation. In total, 202 applications were received from both Ukrainian and international teams, including startups from Warsaw, Berlin, Tallinn, Kaunas, Minnesota, Boston, Dundee, and Hong Kong.</p>\n    <p>With such a diverse pool of participants, the Startup Competition has also become a major draw for investors. This year, its investment fund has reached a record-breaking $12.5mn, offering significant opportunities for startups to scale.</p>\n    <p>In 2024, participants raised over $2mn, demonstrating the event’s power as a bridge between Ukrainian innovators and global <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/topic/investor\">investors</a>. One standout example is Hard Cat Drones, a startup developing unmanned systems for river and maritime operations. Its kamikaze and reconnaissance drones, tested by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, attracted a strategic investment from Double Tap Investments after being showcased at IT Arena 2024.</p>\n    <p>The competition also draws a diverse roster of investors, from local funds to international VCs, all eager to back Ukraine’s proven defence solutions. The average startup valuation is $5mn, with teams typically seeking $600,000 in investment to fuel growth.</p>\n    <p>Initiatives like IT Arena’s Startup Competition show that Ukrainian tech is not just meeting the urgent demands of war — it can also lead the world in defence innovation.</p>\n    <h2>Get the TNW newsletter</h2>\n    <p>Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/ukraine-defence-tech-global-leader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><i>Startup wisdom is a new TNW series offering practical lessons from experts who’ve helped build great companies. This week, global traction strategist Nina Aziz Justin — founder of  The Resilience Mentor — shares her approach to building resilience.</i></p>\n<p>In the startup world, we’re taught to obsess over metrics. Burn rate, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_acquisition_cost\">CAC</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_stream#Recurring_revenue\">MRR</a> — they dominate the dashboards and drive the decisions. And yes, data matters. But there’s something quietly more essential that rarely gets the same spotlight: resilience.</p>\n<p>This piece offers a balanced perspective — one that holds space for both sides. While execution metrics are essential for traction and scale, resilience isn’t just a soft skill. It’s a core operating system — the invisible force that allows a founder to keep showing up, building wisely, and navigating uncertainty with strength and clarity.</p>\n<h3>The case for metrics: why data absolutely matters</h3>\n<p>Let’s be clear: in today’s fast-moving, high-stakes environment, numbers count. Metrics help us validate our ideas, measure momentum, and make informed decisions. They’re how investors assess risk, and how we as <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/topic/founders\">founders</a> understand whether our vision is actually landing in the real world.</p>\n<p>You need to know your CAC. You need to track churn. You need a pulse on retention and cash flow. These aren’t vanity stats — they’re the lifeblood of your business’s sustainability.</p>\n<p>But here’s the rub: strong metrics alone don’t guarantee staying power.</p>\n<p>Time and again, I’ve seen startups with impressive early numbers unravel because of what was happening <i>inside</i> — misaligned founders, decision fatigue, burnout, or simply the loss of joy and vision. That’s why real traction must include more than what’s on the spreadsheet.</p>\n<h3><strong>The power of resilience: it’s more than just grit</strong></h3>\n<p>Resilience is often mistaken for blind persistence — powering through, grinding harder, staying “strong.” But in truth, resilience is more elegant and multidimensional than that.</p>\n<p>In my work, I use a proprietary concept I developed call the “Resilience Triangle” — a way to build resilience from the inside out. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt weaves together three vital threads:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Inner resources</strong>— emotional regulation, clarity of identity, and the ability to stay grounded through highs and lows.</li><li><strong>Business scaffolding</strong>— systems that support you: smart offers, sustainable pricing, clear time boundaries, and a support circle that has your back.</li><li><strong>Restorative rhythm</strong>— recovery, reflection, and recalibration. Because nonstop hustle without pause leads to erosion, not excellence.</li></ul>\n<p><graphic src=\"https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-07-17-at-13.49.16.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the Resilience Triangle\"/></p>\n<p>This isn’t just philosophical. A <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2023/01/the-overlooked-key-to-a-successful-scale-up\">2023 Harvard Business Review</a> study found that startups led by resilience-conscious founders were 38% more likely to survive beyond five years. A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/mckinsey%20global%20surveys/mckinsey-global-surveys-2021-a-year-in-review.pdf\">McKinsey global survey</a> linked resilience-building to a 21% increase in innovation outcomes.</p>\n<p>Most compelling of all is the <a href=\"https://foundology.org/founder-resilience-research/\">2024 Founder Resilience Research Report</a>. Produced by Foundology in collaboration with UCL School of Management and supported by Enterprise Educators UK, the report offers powerful confirmation of what many of us have experienced in the field.  The study — the largest of its kind, involving nearly 400 entrepreneurs — revealed that a striking 92% of founders rank resilience as the most essential entrepreneurial trait, even ahead of communication and problem-solving.</p>\n<p>It reminds us that resilience isn’t just a feel-good factor — it’s a proven, practical lever for startup success.</p>\n<h3>Resilience and execution: not opposites — but intertwined</h3>\n<p>Here’s where we bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>Resilience isn’t the opposite of execution — it’s what fuels effective execution over time. Founders who cultivate resilience make decisions more clearly, recover from setbacks faster, and hold focus amidst pressure. That 92% figure from the Foundology study speaks volumes — resilience is no longer optional, it’s foundational.</p>\n<p>The two aren’t in conflict — they’re co-dependent. Metrics tell the story. Resilience allows you to keep writing the next chapter.</p>\n<h3>Let’s talk about the common critiques</h3>\n<p><strong>“Resilience without execution = stagnation”</strong><br/>\nTrue. But that’s not the kind of resilience I’m talking about. Real resilience moves — it experiments, learns, and adapts. Especially in scrappy, underfunded startups, it’s often the only reason a founder finds creative workarounds instead of quitting.</p>\n<p><strong>“Not every founder needs to be emotionally balanced”</strong><br/>\nFair — not everyone leads from a place of calm. But those who lack resilience are four times more likely to feel overwhelmed, and twice as likely to exit their startup early. Emotional chaos may be survivable in the short term — but it rarely scales.</p>\n<p><strong>“Resilience is a byproduct, not a leading indicator”</strong><br/>\nActually, it’s both. Yes, resilience is forged in the fire — but it can also be proactively cultivated. Teams that intentionally build resilience are more responsive, more resourceful, and less likely to fall apart under pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>“Market conditions, not mindset, determine success”</strong><br/>\nExternal factors matter, absolutely. But it’s the resilient founders who adapt fastest, pivot wisely, and find ways to survive when others stall. In today’s polycrisis world, mindset <i>is</i> strategy.</p>\n<h3>A more balanced lens: metrics + resilience = real traction</h3>\n<p>We’re seeing a shift — a new generation of investors and advisors are beginning to assess both execution metrics and human metrics. Not to be fluffy, but to avoid betting on businesses with glossy numbers and crumbling foundations.</p>\n<p>Resilience, adaptability, and founder alignment are now seen as risk-reducing assets — and rightly so. They don’t replace the numbers. But they give the numbers meaning that lasts.</p>\n<h3>Want to start strengthening resilience in your business?</h3>\n<p>Here are some simple, high-impact places to begin:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/startup-wisdom-resilience-importance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Periods are normal, but there’s no such thing as a normal period!</p>\n<p>For me, a peri-menopausal woman who was surprised by my period every month until trying to get pregnant well into my 30s, this self-awareness and desire of young women to understand their own bodies and cycles is a source of great feminist pride. It is welcome progress from the shame and secrecy traditionally surrounding menstruation education.</p>\n<p>A craving for knowledge and understanding has made cycle tracking apps very popular with women and girls from a young age.<i> “I didn’t know about tracking apps until I was 17”</i>, says Gen Z’er Sara*. Some users are keen to share cycle information with their partner and friends to encourage understanding around mood swings, or share funny stories about loud notifications alerting all to the consistency of their discharge today.</p>\n<p>Cycle tracking apps are certainly having a moment. There are hundreds available on app stores, from simple calendars to full hormone testing. <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-11-21-new-study-reveals-global-trends-menstrual-tracking-app-use\">One study</a> found that the top three cycle tracking apps dominating the market were downloaded 250 million times globally.</p>\n<p>Often framed as simple period prediction tools that aid or avoid pregnancy, most usage of cycle tracking apps relates to everyday mental and physical wellbeing. By logging a wide range of symptoms and events, women and girls can track mood, energy levels, manage health conditions and work with their bodies. Apps can provide health and nutrition information as well as recommendations for exercise and meditation.</p>\n<p>Cycle tracking apps are also the poster girl of what is going wrong with women’s rights today. The dark side of cycle tracking apps are just that — the tracking. The two-fold threat of increased reproductive surveillance and the sale of sensitive data for advertising is in danger of outweighing the benefits of trusting these apps with information about our bodies and state of mind.</p>\n<p>It has been three years since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which ended the federal protection for abortion in the U.S. Many experts at the time urged women to delete cycle tracking apps in the face of the threat of tracking data being used to “prove” an abortion via a missed period. But is this actually what women are doing? Or, are they finding alternative solutions, workarounds, and new ways to engage with these tools?</p>\n<p>Apps that were ahead of the game in terms of a good privacy commitment and track record saw a benefit. Ana Ramirez, co-executive director of <a href=\"https://eukiapp.org/\">Euki</a>, a cycle tracking app and information service remembers, “Our largest download surges were immediately after Roe fell, when Euki received media coverage as a standout privacy period tracker…”</p>\n<p>Amy Thompson, founder of the <a href=\"https://moodymonth.com/\">Moody Month</a> app focused on improving mental health observed, “Moody, like much of the industry, saw users delete apps post-Roe v. Wade, but increased media coverage also drove new downloads.”</p>\n<p>So while many did delete, tracking apps were not abandoned entirely. Ana explains, “People are hungry for a way to track their sexual and reproductive health without giving up their privacy. In this political climate, period trackers aren’t just tools — they’re lifelines.”</p>\n<p>Concerns reached the U.K. where increased surveillance, investigation and prosecution of women suspected of “illegal” abortions after pregnancy loss added to a climate of fear, mistrust and misinformation. Azure*, 16, suspected of the app she uses, <i>“</i>It’s dodgy and sends information to the government. It tracks to see if you’ve had an illegal abortion or something.”</p>\n<p>Chella Quint, founder of <a href=\"https://periodpositive.com/\">Period Positive</a> and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Own-Your-Period-Chella-Quint/dp/0711256632\">Own Your Period </a>saw increased awareness of data privacy risks reaching many U.K. Gen Z’ers in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned which affected their use of cycle tracking apps, <i>“</i>Some people now use workarounds like avoiding login, using a Notes app instead, or tracking their cycles in a paper diary. Others — both adults and children — are aware of the risks but still find the apps too useful to give up.”</p>\n<p>Rose*, 19, agreed “I think most [people] are aware of the issues surrounding privacy and data collection…it’s just a bit overwhelming and I’ve kind of just accepted that it will happen in one way or another.”</p>\n<p>High-profile cases in the U.S. related to data breaches and apps selling or sharing customer data with third parties also led users to seek out privacy respecting alternatives, which pushed companies to raise the bar for stricter privacy standards and win back user trust.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/period-tracking-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For much of the internet’s history, this query is sent in the clear. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS\">DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)</a> plugs this privacy leak by encrypting the DNS messages, so no one on the network, not your internet service provider or a free public WiFi provider, can eavesdrop on your browsing.<br/>In 2020, Firefox became the first browser to roll out <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/firefox-continues-push-to-bring-dns-over-https-by-default-for-us-users/\"> DoH by default</a>, starting in the United States and in 2023, we announced the Firefox </p><p><a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/firefox-by-default-dns-over-https-rollout-in-canada/\">DoH-by-default rollout in Canada</a>, powered by our trusted partner, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA).</p><p>This year, we’ve built on that foundation and delivered major performance improvements and mobile support, ensuring more Firefox users benefit from privacy without compromise.</p><h2><strong>Introducing DoH for Android</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After bringing encrypted DNS protection to millions of desktop users, we’re now extending the same to mobile. Firefox users who have been waiting for DoH on Android can now turn it on and browse with the same privacy protections as on their desktops.</p><p>Starting with this week’s release of <strong>Firefox 143 for Android</strong>, users can choose to enable DoH in Firefox on their mobile devices by selecting “<a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/configure-dns-over-https-protection-levels-firefox-android#w_increased-protection\">Increased Protection”</a> DoH configuration. Performance testing with <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy#Conforming_Resolvers\">Firefox DoH partners</a> is currently underway. If DoH is as fast as we expect, we plan to enable it by default for Android users in certain regions, similar to desktop users. Until then, these configuration options provide you the choice to opt in early.</p><graphic src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/09/image-25-1.png\"/><p><i>Enable DoH in Firefox on Android</i></p><h2><strong>DoH performance breakthroughs in 2025</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>DNS resolution speed is critical to the browsing experience — when web pages involve multiple DNS queries, the speed difference compounds and can cause page loads to be slow. Since we first rolled out DoH in Canada, we’ve worked closely with CIRA for reliability and performance measurements. Through our strong collaboration with them and their technology partner Akamai, Firefox DoH lookups are now <strong>61% faster</strong> year-to-date for the 75th percentile.</p><p>With these performance improvements, DoH resolution time is now within a millisecond or two of native DNS resolution. This is a big win because <strong>Firefox users in Canada now get the privacy of encrypted DNS with no performance penalty</strong>.</p><p>Although the investigation and analysis started with the desire to improve DoH in Firefox, the benefits didn’t end there. Our collaboration also improved CIRA DoH performance for many of its DNS users, including Canadian universities, as well as other DNS providers relying on CIRA’s or Akamai’s server implementations.</p><p>This is a win not just for Firefox users, but for the many other users around the globe.</p><h2><strong>Robust privacy on your terms</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have always approached DoH with an emphasis on transparency, user choice, and strong privacy safeguards. Firefox gives users meaningful control over how their DNS traffic is handled: Users can opt out, choose their own resolver, or adjust DoH protection levels, and Firefox makes it clear what DoH is doing and why it matters.</p><p>Firefox enforces strict requirements for DNS resolvers before trusting them with your browsing. Not every DNS provider can become a DoH provider in Firefox — only those that meet and attest to Mozilla’s rigorous <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy\">Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) policy</a> through a legally binding contract.</p><h2><strong>Prioritizing your privacy and speed</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work with DoH this year shows what’s possible when privacy and performance go hand-in-hand. We’ve proven that encrypted DNS can be fast, reliable, and available on desktop and Android. Just as importantly, we’ve shown that partnerships grounded in open standards and accountability can deliver benefits not only to Firefox users but to the wider internet.</p><p>As we look forward, our commitment stays the same: Privacy should be the default, speed should never be a compromise, and the web should remain open and accessible to everyone. Choosing Firefox means choosing a browser that is built for you and for a better internet.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/\">\n  <graphic width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/10/Visual-Guidelines-800x800.png\" class=\"attachment-1x1 size-1x1\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/10/Visual-Guidelines-800x800.png 800w, https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/10/Visual-Guidelines-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/>  \n  \n     \n</a></p><graphic src=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2021/10/Visual-Guidelines-800x800.png\"/></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/dns-android/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Measuring and improving performance on the Internet can be a daunting task because it spans multiple layers: from the user’s device and browser, to DNS lookups and the network routes, to edge configurations and origin server location. Each layer introduces its own variability such as last-mile bandwidth constraints, third-party scripts, or limited CPU resources, that are often invisible unless you have robust observability tooling in place. Even if you gather data from most of these Internet hops, performance engineers still need to correlate different metrics like front-end events, network processing times, and server-side logs in order to pinpoint where and why elusive “latency” occurs to understand how to fix it. </p>\n<p>We want to solve this problem by providing a powerful, in-depth monitoring solution that helps you debug and optimize applications, so you can understand and trace performance issues across the Internet, end to end.</p>\n<p>That’s why we’re excited to announce the <strong><i>start</i></strong> of a major upgrade to Cloudflare’s performance analytics suite: Web Analytics as part of our real user monitoring (RUM) tools will soon be combined with network-level insights to help you pinpoint performance issues anywhere on a packet’s journey — from a visitor’s browser, through Cloudflare’s network, to your origin.</p>\n<p>Some popular web performance monitoring tools have also sacrificed user privacy in order to achieve depth of visibility. We’re also going to remove that tradeoff. By correlating client-side metrics (like <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/vitals#core_web_vitals\"><u>Core Web Vitals</u></a>) with detailed network and origin data, developers can see where slowdowns occur — and why —  all while preserving end user privacy (by dropping client-specific information and aggregating data by visits as explained in greater detail below).</p>\n<p>Over the next several months we’ll share:</p>\n<p>The journey starts on <strong>October 15, 2025</strong>, when Cloudflare will enable <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/\"><u>Web Analytics</u></a> <strong>for all free domains by default</strong> — helping you see how your site actually performs for visitors around the world in real time, without ever collecting any personal data (not applicable to traffic originating from the EU or UK, <a href=\"#what-does-privacy-first-mean\">see below</a>). By the middle of 2026, we’ll deliver something nobody has ever had before: a comprehensive, <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics/\"><u>privacy-first platform</u></a> for performance monitoring and debugging. Unlike many other tools, this platform won’t just show you where latency lives, it will help you fix it, all in one place. From untangling the trickiest bottlenecks, to getting a crystal-clear view of global performance, this new tool will change how you see your web application and experiment with new performance features. And we’re not building it behind closed doors, we want to bring you along as we launch it in public. Follow along in this series, <i>The RUM Diaries</i>, as we share the journey.</p>\n<p>Performance monitoring is only as good as the detail you can see — and the trust your users have that while you’re watching traffic performance, you aren’t watching <i>them</i>. As we explain below, by combining <strong>real user metrics</strong> with <strong>deep, in-network instrumentation</strong>, we’ll give developers the visibility to debug any layer of the stack while maintaining Cloudflare’s zero-compromise stance on privacy.</p>\n<h2>What problem are we solving? </h2>\n<p>Many performance monitoring solutions provide only a narrow slice of the performance layer cake, focusing on either the client or the origin while lumping everything in between under a vague “processing time” due to lack of visibility. But as web applications get more complex and user expectations continue to rise, traditional analytics alone don’t cut it. Knowing <i>what</i> happened is just the tip of the iceberg; modern teams need to understand <i>why</i> a bottleneck occurred and <i>how</i> network conditions, code changes, or even a single external script can degrade load times. Moreover, often the tools available can only <i>observe</i> performance rather than helping to optimize it, which leaves teams unable to understand what to try to move the needle on latency.</p>\n<p>We want to pull back the curtain so you can understand performance implications of the services you use on our platform and how you can make sure you’re getting the best performance possible. </p>\n<p>Consider Shannon in Detroit, Michigan. She operates an e-commerce site selling hard-to-find watches to horology enthusiasts around the globe. Shannon knows that her customers are impatient (she pictures them frequently checking their wrists). If her site loads slowly, she loses sales, her SEO drops, and her customers go to a different store where they have a better online shopping experience. </p>\n<p>As a result, Shannon continually monitors her site performance, but she frequently runs into problems trying to understand how her site is experienced by customers in different parts of the world. After updating her site, she frequently spot checks its performance using her browser on her office wifi in Detroit, but she continually hears complaints about slow load from her customers in Germany. So Shannon shops around for a solution that monitors performance around the globe. </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-rum-diaries-enabling-web-analytics-by-default/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

This thing is simply beautiful, a tribute to sound.</p>\n    <p>For all the criticism of <i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i> — its weird tonal shifts and slow pace in the series’ first big-screen adaptation — Jerry Goldsmith’s score is sublime and evocative. This film is probably responsible for my unhealthy obsession with bowing random objects later in life. (Second thought — healthy!) And honestly, if you have problems with the film, just close your eyes and imagine it to this. Goldsmith melds melodramatic classic Hollywood flourishes with uneasy metallic timbres.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>At least 187 code packages made available through the JavaScript repository <strong>NPM</strong> have been infected with a self-replicating worm that steals credentials from developers and publishes those secrets on <strong>GitHub</strong>, experts warn. The malware, which briefly infected multiple code packages from the security vendor <strong>CrowdStrike</strong>, steals and publishes even more credentials every time an infected package is installed.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shai-hulud.png\"/>\n    <p>Image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_(Dune)</p>\n    <p>The novel malware strain is being dubbed <strong>Shai-Hulud</strong> — after the name for the giant sandworms in Frank Herbert’s <i>Dune</i> novel series — because it publishes any stolen credentials in a new public GitHub repository that includes the name “Shai-Hulud.”</p>\n    <p>“When a developer installs a compromised package, the malware will look for a npm token in the environment,” said <strong>Charlie Eriksen</strong>, a researcher for the Belgian security firm <a href=\"https://www.aikido.dev/blog/s1ngularity-nx-attackers-strike-again\">Aikido</a>. “If it finds it, it will modify the 20 most popular packages that the npm token has access to, copying itself into the package, and publishing a new version.”</p>\n    <p>At the center of this developing maelstrom are code libraries available on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\"> NPM</a> (short for “Node Package Manager”), which acts as a central hub for JavaScript development and provides the latest updates to widely-used JavaScript components.</p>\n    <p>The Shai-Hulud worm emerged just days after unknown attackers <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/18-popular-code-packages-hacked-rigged-to-steal-crypto/\">launched a broad phishing campaign</a> that spoofed NPM and asked developers to “update” their multi-factor authentication login options. That attack led to malware being inserted into at least two-dozen NPM code packages, but the outbreak was quickly contained and was narrowly focused on siphoning cryptocurrency payments.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shai-hulud-packages.png\"/>\n    <p>Image: aikido.dev</p>\n    <p>In late August, another compromise of an NPM developer resulted in malware being added to “<strong>nx</strong>,” an open-source code development toolkit with as many as six million weekly downloads. In the nx compromise, the attackers introduced code that scoured the user’s device for authentication tokens from programmer destinations like GitHub and NPM, as well as SSH and API keys. But instead of sending those stolen credentials to a central server controlled by the attackers, the malicious nx code created a new public repository in the victim’s GitHub account, and published the stolen data there for all the world to see and download.</p>\n    <p>Last month’s attack on nx did not self-propagate like a worm, but this Shai-Hulud malware does and bundles reconnaissance tools to assist in its spread. Namely, it uses the open-source tool <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog\">TruffleHog</a> to search for exposed credentials and access tokens on the developer’s machine. It then attempts to create new GitHub actions and publish any stolen secrets.</p>\n    <p>“Once the first person got compromised, there was no stopping it,” Aikido’s Eriksen told KrebsOnSecurity. He said the first NPM package compromised by this worm appears to have been altered on Sept. 14, around 17:58 UTC.</p>\n    <p>The security-focused code development platform <strong>socket.dev</strong> <a href=\"https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages\">reports</a> the Shai-Halud attack briefly compromised at least 25 NPM code packages managed by CrowdStrike. Socket.dev said the affected packages were quickly removed by the NPM registry.</p>\n    <p>In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, CrowdStrike said that after detecting several malicious packages in the public NPM registry, the company swiftly removed them and rotated its keys in public registries.</p>\n    <p>“These packages are not used in the Falcon sensor, the platform is not impacted and customers remain protected,” the statement reads, referring to the company’s widely-used endpoint threat detection service. “We are working with NPM and conducting a thorough investigation.”</p>\n    <p>A <a href=\"https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised\">writeup on the attack</a> from <strong>StepSecurity</strong> found that for cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform secrets. It also found the entire attack design assumes the victim is working in a Linux or macOS environment, and that it deliberately skips Windows systems.</p>\n    <p>StepSecurity said Shai-Hulud spreads by using stolen NPM authentication tokens, adding its code to the top 20 packages in the victim’s account.</p>\n    <p>“This creates a cascading effect where an infected package leads to compromised maintainer credentials, which in turn infects all other packages maintained by that user,” StepSecurity’s <strong>Ashish Kurmi</strong> wrote.</p>\n    <p>Eriksen said Shai-Hulud is still propagating, although its spread seems to have waned in recent hours.</p>\n    <p>“I still see package versions popping up once in a while, but no new packages have been compromised in the last ~6 hours,” Eriksen said. “But that could change now as the east coast starts working. I would think of this attack as a ‘living’ thing almost, like a virus. Because it can lay dormant for a while, and if just one person is suddenly infected by accident, they could restart the spread. Especially if there’s a super-spreader attack.”</p>\n    <p>For now, it appears that the web address the attackers were using to exfiltrate collected data was disabled due to rate limits, Eriksen said.</p>\n    <p><strong>Nicholas Weaver</strong> is a researcher with the <strong>International Computer Science Institute</strong>, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver called the Shai-Hulud worm “a supply chain attack that conducts a supply chain attack.” Weaver said NPM (and all other similar package repositories) need to immediately switch to a publication model that requires explicit human consent for every publication request using a phish-proof 2FA method.</p>\n    <p>“Anything less means attacks like this are going to continue and become far more common, but switching to a 2FA method would effectively throttle these attacks before they can spread,” Weaver said. “Allowing purely automated processes to update the published packages is now a proven recipe for disaster.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/self-replicating-worm-hits-180-software-packages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The NotPetya attack is believed to be the most destructive cyberattack in history, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/\">with more than $10 billion in total damages</a>. Despite NotPetya’s similarity to the Petya ransomware, first <a href=\"https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2016/03/28226-ransomware-petya-a-technical-review\">discovered in March 2016</a>, NotPetya’s purpose was pure destruction, as encryption key recovery from the victim’s personal installation key was not possible. Because of the shared characteristics of the currently discovered samples with both Petya and NotPetya, we named the new discovery HybridPetya.</p>\n<p>While ESET telemetry shows no active use of HybridPetya in the wild, one important detail in these samples still caught our attention – unlike the original NotPetya (and Petya ransomware as well), HybridPetya is also capable of compromising modern UEFI-based systems by installing a malicious EFI application to the EFI System Partition. The deployed UEFI application is then responsible for encryption of the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/ntfs-overview\">NTFS</a>-related <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/master-file-table\">Master File Table</a> (MFT) file – an important metadata file containing information about all the files on the NTFS-formatted partition.</p>\n<p>After a bit more digging, we discovered something even more interesting on VirusTotal: <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/796b0ef499e99cef5a5e9df60a4b7aef42f83cfccfa6df14f946121c2ba7283c/details\">an archive</a> containing the whole EFI System Partition contents, including a very similar HybridPetya UEFI application, but this time bundled in a specially formatted cloak.dat file, vulnerable to CVE‑2024‑7344 – the <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/under-cloak-uefi-secure-boot-introducing-cve-2024-7344/\">UEFI Secure Boot bypass vulnerability</a> – that our team disclosed in early 2025.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, despite the filenames on VirusTotal and the format of the ransom note in the current samples suggesting that they might be related to NotPetya, the algorithm used for the generation of the victim’s personal installation key, unlike in the original NotPetya, allows the malware operator to reconstruct the decryption key from the victim’s personal installation keys. Thus, HybridPetya can serve as regular ransomware (more like Petya), rather than being solely destructive like NotPetya.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, on September 9<sup>th</sup>, 2025, <a href=\"https://x.com/hasherezade\">@hasherezade</a> published a <a href=\"https://x.com/hasherezade/status/1965389009175412769\">post</a> about the existence of a UEFI Petya PoC, with a video demonstrating execution of the malware with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Even though the sample from the video is obviously different from the one presented in this blogpost (showing the typical Petya ASCII art skull, which is not present in the samples we discovered), we suspect that there might be some relationship between the two cases, and that HybridPetya might also be just a proof of concept developed by a security researcher or an unknown threat actor.</p>\n<p>In this blogpost, we focus on the technical analysis of HybridPetya.</p>\n<h2>HybridPetya technical analysis</h2>\n<p>In this section, we provide a technical analysis of HybridPetya’s components: the bootkit and its installer. We also separately dissect a version of HybridPetya that is capable of bypassing UEFI Secure Boot by exploiting CVE-2024-7344. Note that HybridPetya supports both legacy and UEFI based systems – in this blogpost, we’ll focus on the UEFI part.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the code responsible for generating the victims’ personal installation keys seems to be inspired by the <a href=\"https://github.com/FirstBlood12/RedPetyaOpenSSL\">RedPetyaOpenSSL</a> PoC. We are aware of at least one other UEFI-compatible PoC rewrite of NotPetya, dubbed <a href=\"https://github.com/rdp-studio/NotPetyaAgain\">NotPetyaAgain</a>, which is written in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a>; however, that code is unrelated to HybridPetya.</p>\n<h3>UEFI bootkit<a href=\"\"/></h3>\n<p>We obtained two distinct versions of the UEFI bootkit component, both very similar but with certain differences. When executed, the bootkit first loads its configuration from the \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\config file, and checks the encryption flag indicating the current encryption status – same as the original Petya/NotPetya samples, the encryption flag can have one of the following values:</p>\n<ul><li>0 - ready for encryption,</li><li>1 - already encrypted, or</li><li>2 - ransom paid, disk decrypted.</li></ul>\n<p>It continues with execution based on the encryption status flag, as shown in Figure 1.</p>\n<p><i>Figure 1. Overview of HybridPetya’s execution logic</i></p>\n<p>If the value of the encryption flag is 0, the bootkit extracts the 32-byte-long <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20\">Salsa20</a> encryption key and 8-byte-long nonce from the configuration data, and subsequently rewrites the configuration file, now with the encryption key zeroed and the encryption flag set to 1. It continues with encryption of the \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\verify file with the Salsa20 encryption algorithm using the key and nonce from the configuration. Then, before proceeding to its main functionality – disk encryption – it creates the file \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\counter on the EFI System Partition; the purpose of this file is explained later.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/introducing-hybridpetya-petya-notpetya-copycat-uefi-secure-boot-bypass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But new findings show those sanctions have done little to stop Stark from simply rebranding and transferring their assets to other corporate entities controlled by its original hosting providers.</p>\n<p>Image: Shutterstock.</p>\n<p>Materializing just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Stark Industries Solutions became a frequent source of massive DDoS attacks, Russian-language proxy and VPN services, malware tied to Russia-backed hacking groups, and fake news. ISPs like Stark are called “bulletproof” providers when they cultivate a reputation for ignoring any abuse complaints or police inquiries about activity on their networks.</p>\n<p>In May 2025, the European Union <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500965\">sanctioned</a> one of Stark’s two main conduits to the larger Internet — Moldova-based <strong>PQ Hosting</strong> — as well as the company’s Moldovan owners <strong>Yuri</strong> and <strong>Ivan Neculiti</strong>. The EU Commission said the Neculiti brothers and PQ Hosting were linked to Russia’s hybrid warfare efforts.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/one-step-ahead-stark-industries-solutions-preempts-eu-sanctions\">a new report</a> from <strong>Recorded Future</strong> finds that just prior to the sanctions being announced, Stark rebranded to <strong>the[.]hosting</strong>, under control of the Dutch entity <strong>WorkTitans BV</strong> (AS209847) on June 24, 2025. The Neculiti brothers reportedly got a heads up roughly 12 days before the sanctions were announced, when Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the sanctions package.</p>\n<p>In response, the Neculiti brothers moved much of Stark’s considerable address space and other resources over to a new company in Moldova called <strong>PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L</strong>., an entity reportedly connected to the Neculiti brothers thanks to <a href=\"https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/russland-ukraine/2024/05/16/hacks-und-propaganda-zwei-brueder-aus-moldau-tragen-russlands-digitalen-krieg-nach-europa/#:~:text=web%20hosting%20service%2C-,Morenehost,-%2C%20writes%20the%20IT\">the re-use of a phone number</a> from the original PQ Hosting.</p>\n<p>“Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities,” Recorded Future observed.</p>\n<p>Neither the Recorded Future report nor the May 2025 sanctions from the EU mentioned a second critical pillar of Stark’s network that KrebsOnSecurity identified in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/\">a May 2024 profile on the notorious bulletproof hoster</a>: The Netherlands-based hosting provider <strong>MIRhosting</strong>.</p>\n<p>MIRhosting is operated by 38-year old <strong>Andrey Nesterenko</strong>, whose <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141221134456/http://www.nesterenko.name/en/index.html\">personal website</a> says he is an accomplished concert pianist who began performing publicly at a young age. <strong>DomainTools</strong> says mirhosting[.]com is registered to Mr. Nesterenko and to <strong>Innovation IT Solutions Corp</strong>, which lists addresses in London and in Nesterenko’s stated hometown of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.</p>\n<p>Image credit: correctiv.org.</p>\n<p>According to the book <i>Inside Cyber Warfare</i> by Jeffrey Carr, Innovation IT Solutions Corp. was responsible for hosting <strong>StopGeorgia[.]ru</strong>, a hacktivist website for organizing cyberattacks against Georgia that appeared at the same time Russian forces invaded the former Soviet nation in 2008.

    "body": "<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multi-Agent Systems: The Next Frontier in AI-Driven Cyber Defense<br>\nImage by Editor | ChatGPT<br></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The increasing sophistication of cyber threats calls for a systemic change in the way we defend ourselves against them. Traditional security solutions, and legacy solutions, function in silos, and often struggle with dynamic and coordinated attacks. Multi-agent systems (MAS), on the other hand, utilize collaboration and agent dependent solutions, which enable a combination of AI agents to work together, mimicking human collaboration, as a “system”, while providing machine speed and scale when enhancing the cybersecurity posture of an organization.</p>\n<h2>The Power of Decentralized, Collaborative AI</h2>\n<p>At the heart of a MAS are many intelligent agents that act together, where agents are software entities capable of autonomous actions. In cyber security, the agents in a multi-agent system are intelligent systems that can observe their environments, arbitrate optimal actions, and act collectively to collaboratively detect, respond and respectively reduce cyber threat risk. AI agents are special because they can dynamically analyze new data or context from their investigations and autonomously adapt their actions based on similarities and growth, as they can presumably synthesised large amounts of information across multiple domains and generally develop from experimentation.</p>\n<p>The main advantages of using MAS in cybersecurity include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: Agents can be added or removed at will and, because of this, MAS can be more easily scaled to a diverse range of network sizes and complexities from small businesses to huge enterprises\n</li><li>Adaptability: Agents adapt to new data points, in that they can learn and adjust their algorithms for detection and response, they can adapt to new data without human intervention, allowing organizations to have a strong (proactive) defence against threats which evolve\n</li><li>Fault Tolerant: Failures in one agent do not prevent other agents from operating leading to guaranteed continued protection and resilience\n</li><li>Collaboration: Agents share information and coordinate responses, resulting in faster mitigation, fewer false positives, and a larger understanding of the threat landscape and increased situational awareness\n</li></ul>\n<h2>Practical Applications in Cyber Defense</h2>\n<p>Multi-Agent Systems are already revolutionizing security operations in several key areas:</p>\n<h3>Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS)</h3>\n<p>Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) typically offer a centralized approach to analysis, which can lead to latencies, or possible delays. With MAS, DIDS allow agents to monitor their own slice of the network in isolation, but share information to make sense of how seemingly coordinated attacks across multiple network segments occurred. For example, one agent may identify suspicious traffic patterns around a server, while another agent may relate this suspicious activity to anomalous user logins on a different endpoint, which collectively points to a multi-stage attack.</p>\n<h3>Automated Incident Response</h3>\n<p>MAS has the potential to automate complex incident response processes, and potentially prevent delays in incident response by allowing agents to perform the appropriate response tasks without the need for human intervention. Agents can be assigned to isolate infected machines, block suspicious IP’s, quarantine files, or roll back compromised configurations. This capability can reduce incident response time to minutes; ultimately preventing an attacker from harming even more systems. For example, an AI agent may identify a malware, analyze it, identify how it propagates, and could easily instruct agents to block its network connections, quarantine affected machines, etc.</p>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Sharing</h3>\n<p>Agents in an MAS environment can also use communication and real-time threat intelligence from other agents that are leveraging external databases, threat intelligence platforms or other MAS deployments. It has collective defense capabilities which enhances an organizations’ capabilities to spot, understand, and defend against current or emerging threats while they are still forming into attacks by creating a “common picture” of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>\n<h3>Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)</h3>\n<p>The multifaceted nature of multi-cloud environments poses enormous challenges for security teams. AI agents may be able to assess the context of alerts produced by CSPM tools and prioritize high-risk misconfigurations, and in some cases, autonomously remediate the issues by updating infrastructure-as-code or raising a pull request for the human user. AI agents can also understand the correlation of data across multiple cloud providers and offer a coherent and unified security posture.</p>\n<h3>The Human-Agent Collaboration</h3>\n<p>Even though MAS allows for automation and intelligence-behavior of unprecedented amounts, the human component is extremely important. In fact, MAS does not aim to replace security analysts, but to supplement their work. AI agents are adept at repetitive high workloads, processing large amounts of data, and distinguishing anomalies, as well as other jobs, more quickly than a person. Consequently, AI agents allow human analysts to concentrate on high-complexity threats, strategic actions, and make any calls requiring human judgement and intuition etc.</p>\n<p>The future of cyber defense resides in the collaborative model. Humans will be needed to provide oversight, define high-level objectives, and validate agent behaviors and actions so that these advanced systems operate ethically and by policy.</p>\n<h2>Challenges and Future Directions</h2>\n<p>Although MAS holds great promise as a suitable technology for realizing cyber defense solutions, there are challenges in deploying MAS. These include trustworthiness and explainability of agent decisions, ensuring agent actions/reactions are predictable when interacting with other agents, and agent protection from being compromised. Research exploring ideas such as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is looking at how agents may be able to learn and adapt to changing dynamics in a cyber environment, in addition to adversarial robustness to elevate agent robustness against advanced attacks that target the AI.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-agent-systems-the-next-frontier-in-ai-driven-cyber-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, the precision-recall (PR) curve plots precision against recall for different thresholds, focusing on analyzing performance for positive class predictions. Therefore, it is particularly useful and informative for comprehensively evaluating classifiers trained on imbalanced datasets. The ROC curve, on the other hand, is less sensitive to class imbalance, being more suitable for evaluating classifiers built on rather balanced datasets, as well as in scenarios where the real-world cost of false positive and false negative predictions is similar.</p>\n<p>In sum, back to the PR curve and class imbalance datasets, in high-stakes scenarios where correctly identifying positive-class instances is crucial (e.g. identifying the presence of a disease in a patient), the PR curve is a more reliable measure of the classifier’s performance. </p>\n<p>On a more visual note, if we plot both curves alongside each other, we should get an increasing curve in the case of ROC and a decreasing curve in the case of PR. The closer the ROC curve gets to the (0,1) point, meaning the highest TPR and the lowest FPR, the better; whereas the closer the PR curve gets to the (1,1) point, meaning both precision and recall are at their maximum, the better. In both bases, getting closer to these “perfect model points” means the area under the curve or AUC becomes maximum: this is the numerical value we will seek in the examples that follow.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example ROC curve and precision-recall curve<br>\nImage by Author<br></p>\n<p>To illustrate the use and comparison between ROC AUC and precision-recall (PR curve for short), we will consider three datasets with different levels of class imbalance: from mildly to highly imbalanced.

In this landscape, Desktop as a Service (DaaS) is emerging as a strategic enabler, not just a technical solution. It’s redefining how businesses empower their people, secure their data, and adapt to constant change.</p>\n    <p>Microsoft is at the forefront of reimagining DaaS, extending beyond virtual desktops to deliver a platform for business agility, resilience, and human-centric innovation. Our Leader position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Desktop as a Service for three consecutive years, we believe, reflects our commitment to driving this evolution.</p>\n    <p>This graphic was published by Gartner, Inc. as part of a larger research document and should be evaluated in the context of the entire document. The Gartner document is available at aka.ms/DaasMQ2025.</p>\n    <p>Our vision goes even further with the unique combination of DaaS and AI leadership. With innovations like Microsoft Copilot, Security Copilot, and agentic experiences powered by custom silicon and NPUs, customers benefit from intelligent automation, personalized support, and continuous improvement. The vision is realized through a holistic platform—one that empowers people, simplifies IT, and adapts to the unique needs of businesses across industries, enabling them to unlock new models of work, drive efficiency, and support their teams anytime, anywhere.</p>\n    <p>The following five pillars illustrate how Microsoft is building the next generation of digital workspaces, setting new standards for what’s possible in the modern enterprise.</p>\n    <h2>Building the next generation of digital workspaces</h2>\n    <p><strong>1. Empowering the modern workforce:</strong> Microsoft’s deep enterprise footprint means we understand the complexities of today’s organizations. Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop are designed to meet the needs of every worker, from frontline staff to global teams, enabling secure access to resources anywhere, anytime.</p>\n    <p><strong>2. Building an integrated ecosystem:</strong> True transformation happens when technologies work seamlessly together. By integrating Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop with Microsoft 365, Intune, Defender, and other core services, we simplify management, enhance security, and create a unified experience that supports productivity and compliance at scale.</p>\n    <p><strong>3. Scaling with global reach and trust:</strong> With data centers worldwide, Microsoft offers unmatched geographic coverage and compliance capabilities. Our customers can confidently navigate regulatory requirements and deliver consistent experiences to users in every region.</p>\n    <p><strong>4. Enabling flexibility and choice:</strong> No two organizations are alike. That’s why we offer flexible licensing and deployment models—fully managed with Windows 365 or customizable with Azure Virtual Desktop—so customers can choose the approach that best fits their strategy and growth plans.</p>\n    <p><strong>5. Innovating for the future:</strong> We’re investing in AI-driven management, performance optimization, and user experience enhancements. Our roadmap is clear: empower organizations to harness the full potential of cloud desktops, drive continuous improvement, and anticipate the needs of tomorrow’s workforce.</p>\n    <h2>The strategic impact of DaaS</h2>\n    <p>DaaS is about enabling new business models, supporting sustainability goals, unlocking talent across borders, and delivering seamless productivity for every organization. With Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, organizations can more easily embrace digital transformation rethink processes, reduce costs, build resilient operations, and empower their teams to work securely and efficiently – anytime, anywhere.</p>\n    <p>For complimentary access to the Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Desktop as a Service report, please click <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2LL3GETN&amp;ct=250801&amp;st=sb\">here</a>.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Desktop as a Service, By Stuart Downes, Sunil Kumar, Todd Larivee, 11 August 2025.

The changes to the sections, which pertained to congressional powers, the rights of individual states, and the rights to due process, sparked alarm at a time when the Trump administration has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qgz18glljo\">threatened to suspend habeas corpus</a>.</p>\n    <p>After the changes were reported, the Library of Congress tweeted that the sections were missing due to a “coding error.”</p>\n    <p>TechCrunch reached out to the Library of Congress and received more insight into the issue:</p>\n    <p>“The online Constitution Annotated is an educational tool which includes discussions of the Supreme Court’s latest opinions linked to the text of the Constitution. When updating the site to reflect our constitutional scholars’ analysis of the impact of the latest cases on Article I, Sections 8-10, the team inadvertently removed an XML tag,” Bill Ryan, the director of communications for the Library of Congress, told TechCrunch.</p>\n    <p>“This prevented publication of everything in Article I after the middle of Section 8. The problem has been corrected, and our updated constitutional analysis is now available. We are taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the future,” said Ryan.</p>\n    <p>XML is a commonly used markup language used by the Library of Congress to format its website. A missing closing tag could plausibly result in missing text from the website, as anything outside of the tag would be ignored.</p>\n    <p>The full text of the Constitution has now been reinstated on the Library of Congress <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/\">website</a>.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/library-of-congress-explains-how-parts-of-us-constitution-vanished-from-its-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

GPT-5 is a significant leap in intelligence and becomes even more powerful when applied to work.</p>\n<p>Bringing GPT-5 to Copilot on the day of its release is part of our commitment to make OpenAI’s latest models available to customers in Microsoft 365 Copilot within 30 days. Copilot delivers the latest AI innovation, tuned for work and tailored to your business needs—with the security, compliance, and privacy that you expect from Microsoft.</p>\n<p>Here’s how GPT-5 shows up in Copilot:</p>\n<ul><li>For the first time, Copilot can take your prompt, understand it, and use GPT-5’s <strong>real-time router</strong>to choose the best model to reason over the prompt and craft a response.</li><li>For common or routine questions, Copilot prioritizes speed, using GPT-5’s smart, <strong>high-throughput model</strong>to craft quick, succinct responses to your straightforward questions.</li><li>For complex or more open-ended questions, Copilot can now detect that the prompt requires advanced reasoning. In those cases, Copilot will use GPT-5’s <strong>deeper reasoning model</strong>, taking its time to craft a plan, gather and comprehend all relevant context, and check its work before providing a thorough response.</li></ul>\n<h2>The right model for the right job</h2>\n<p>Copilot automatically selects the right model based on the context to more closely mirror how humans approach problems—whether that’s offering quick, intuitive answers to simple problems, or taking more time to apply deeper reasoning to answer more complex ones.</p>\n<p>Say you’re a marketer considering request for proposal (RFP) responses from a few different agencies. You can ask Copilot to track down the responses and summarize each. It understands your simple request, scans your work data, and quickly comes back with the list you asked for.</p>\n<p>Let’s go a step further and ask for Copilot’s help evaluating and stack-ranking the RFP responses. Copilot recognizes this is a more complex request and routes to GPT-5’s reasoning model. With the full context of your work data like documents, emails, meetings, and chats, Copilot applies relevant, proprietary context to a highly specific process, giving you a thoughtful recommendation for selecting an agency.</p>\n<p>With GPT-5, Copilot can provide <strong>both fast, fluent responses and deep, reasoned analyses</strong>. This two-brain approach is what makes the GPT‑5 era of Copilot particularly powerful.</p>\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n<p>GPT‑5 in Copilot is available starting today to reason over both web and work data for licensed Microsoft 365 Copilot users and will be rolled out to users without a license in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot\">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> and start transforming work with Copilot today. For the latest research insights on the future of work and generative AI, visit <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/\">WorkLab</a>. </p>\n<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong>:</h3>\n<p>For users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, GPT-5 is available today to reason over both web and work data in Microsoft 365––your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and contacts––to provide full contextual responses. These users will see a new “Try GPT-5” button in Copilot Chat. Once activated, Copilot will use GPT-5 for that session. Users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses will get priority access to GPT-5, including more predictable quality and performance.</p>\n<p>For users without Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, GPT-5 will begin rolling out today, and availability for all users expected in the coming weeks. Users will get <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/12c8d9f8-db32-4f99-8ebe-d8d85879137f\">standard access</a>.</p>\n<p>We are also making GPT-5 available in <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/?p=5762\">Copilot Studio</a>, our platform for building custom agents. Starting today, you can select GPT-5 as their agent’s primary model and use GPT-5 in custom prompts to enable their agents to take on more complex and ambitious business processes.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, we introduced Researcher, our advanced reasoning agent built on OpenAI’s deep research model. While GPT-5 dramatically enhances Copilot’s ability to handle complex, everyday prompts, Researcher is purpose-built for those times where you need deep, research-intensive work. It excels when you need exhaustive reasoning and synthesis across many sources, whether internal content or external websites. It’s ideal for projects like board-level briefs, competitive analyses, and comprehensive client prep.</p>\n<p>For all users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, try the following:</p>\n<ul><li>“Read through my recent emails and chats and provide a comprehensive analysis of my communication style by identifying my core values, strengths, weaknesses, skills, and areas where I can improve professionally.”</li><li>“Get me up to speed on the latest plans related to [project/initiative]. Help me think through what to do next.”</li><li>“Reflecting on our [project], what went well and what didn’t? Can you draft a brief ‘lessons learned’ summary as if we were documenting a post-mortem for it?”</li><li>“Look at the last 5 work days, identify all the meetings where I was working on GPT-5, and give me a total number of hours I spent on the topic.”</li></ul>\n<p>For all users, including those without Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, try the following:</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Seduced by the fruits of scale, some have come to believe that it provides a clear pathway to AGI. The most emblematic case of this is the multimodal approach, in which massive modular networks are optimized for an array of modalities that, taken together, <i>appear</i> general. However, I argue that this strategy is sure to fail in the near term; it will not lead to human-level AGI that can, e.g., perform sensorimotor reasoning, motion planning, and social coordination. Instead of trying to glue modalities together into a patchwork AGI, <strong>we should pursue approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with the environment as primary</strong>, and see modality-centered processing as emergent phenomena.</p>\n<p>Preface: Disembodied definitions of Artificial General Intelligence — emphasis on <i>general</i> — exclude crucial problem spaces that we should expect AGI to be able to solve. <strong>A true AGI must be general across all domains.</strong> Any <i>complete</i> definition must at least include the ability to solve problems that originate in physical reality, e.g. repairing a car, untying a knot, preparing food, etc. As I will discuss in the next section, <strong>what is needed for these problems is a form of intelligence that is fundamentally situated in something like a physical world model</strong>. For more discussion on this, look out for <i>Designing an Intelligence</i>. Edited by George Konidaris, MIT Press, forthcoming.</p>\n<h2>Why We Need the World, and How LLMs Pretend to Understand It</h2>\n<p>TLDR: I first argue that <strong>true AGI needs a physical understanding of the world</strong>, as many problems <a href=\"https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/papers/thinking-machines.html\">cannot be converted into a problem of symbol manipulation</a>. It has been suggested by some that LLMs are learning a model of the world through next token prediction, but it is more likely that LLMs are learning bags of heuristics to predict tokens. This leaves them with a superficial understanding of reality and contributes to false impressions of their intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>The most shocking result of the predict-next-token objective is that it yields AI models that reflect a deeply human-like understanding of the world, despite having never observed it like we have.</strong> This result has <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/\">led to confusion</a> about what it means to <i>understand language</i> and even to <i>understand the world</i> — something we have long believed to be a prerequisite for language understanding. <strong>One explanation for the capabilities of LLMs comes from </strong><strong>an emerging theory</strong><strong> suggesting that they induce models of the world through next-token prediction</strong>. Proponents of this theory cite the prowess of SOTA LLMs on various benchmarks, the <a href=\"https://phillipi.github.io/prh/\">convergence of large models to similar internal representations</a>, and their favorite rendition of the idea that “language mirrors the structure of reality,” a notion that has been espoused at least by Plato, Wittgenstein, Foucault, and Eco. While I’m generally in support of digging up esoteric texts for research inspiration, I’m worried that this metaphor has been taken too literally. Do LLMs really learn implicit models of the world? How could they otherwise be so proficient at language?</p>\n<p>One source of evidence in favor of the LLM world modeling hypothesis is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13382\">the Othello paper</a>, wherein researchers were able to predict the board of an Othello game from the hidden states of a transformer model trained on sequences of <i>legal</i> <i>moves</i>. However, there are <i>many</i> issues with generalizing these results to models of natural language. For one, whereas Othello moves can <i>provably</i> be used to deduce the full state of an Othello board,<strong> we have no reason to believe that a complete picture of the physical world can be inferred by a linguistic description. </strong>What sets the game of Othello apart from many tasks in the physical world is that <strong>Othello fundamentally resides in the land of symbols, and is merely implemented using physical tokens to make it easier for humans to play.</strong> A full game of Othello can be played with just pen and paper, but one can’t, e.g., sweep a floor, do dishes, or drive a car with just pen and paper. To solve such tasks, you need some physical conception of the world beyond what humans can merely <i>say</i> about it. Whether that conception of the world is encoded in a formal world model or, e.g., a value function is up for debate, but it is clear that <strong>there are many problems in the physical world that </strong><strong>cannot</strong><strong> be </strong><strong>fully represented by a system of symbols</strong><strong> and solved with mere symbol manipulation.</strong></p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

TL;DR: No!</h1>\n    <p>OpenAI, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, xAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Google, Apple… all these companies are racing to build AGI by 2025, and once achieved, it will be replicated by dozens of others within weeks. The idea of creating a compressed knowledge base of humanity, extracting information, and iterating on outputs to optimize results is no longer revolutionary. Thousands of engineers worldwide can replicate what OpenAI has accomplished because it primarily involves scaling up Transformers — a model developed by Google, which itself was just an advancement of prior AI research.</p>\n    <p>But what comes next?</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Workforce</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The next big shift: Every company on the planet will start replacing workloads with AGI wherever possible to maximize profit margins. Companies won’t hire as much because their existing employees will be 10x more productive with AI agents.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Startups and New Companies</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Launching new startups — many of which are essentially databases with a layer of applications — will become nearly impossible. Why? Because SaaS is much more than just a product; it involves extensive behind-the-scenes deals, massive distribution networks, and an established customer base. Existing SaaS giants will dominate every corner of the industry, leveraging AGI to achieve 100x more efficient processes. New players will struggle to compete. Founders traditionally find opportunities in dysfunctional parts of the industry or niche markets, but with AGI, even those opportunities will vanish.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Healthcare</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Diagnostic medicine will be one of the first sectors disrupted by AGI. Initially, there will be talks about fairness, democratizing healthcare, and empowering doctors by “keeping humans in the loop.” However, over time, the economic pressure and efficiency of AGI will reduce the role of doctors, eventually replacing them with AGI and healthcare robotics. The sector’s current shortages and inefficiencies will accelerate this transformation.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Humanity’s Transformation</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Every aspect of humanity will change — not solely because of OpenAI, xAI, Google DeepMind, or others — but because AGI can be built by anyone with enough incentives and the resources to purchase GPUs. And with GPU costs dropping over time, AGI development will become increasingly accessible.</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>So, What’s the Right Move?</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>There will be countless positive aspects to the emergence of AGI, but you need to make the right decisions now!

    "body": "<h3>What is the Role of Mathematics in Modern Machine Learning?</h3>\n<p>The past decade has witnessed a shift in how progress is made in machine learning. Research involving carefully designed and mathematically principled architectures result in only marginal improvements while compute-intensive and engineering-first efforts that scale to ever larger training sets and model parameter counts result in remarkable new capabilities unpredicted by existing theory. Mathematics and statistics, once the primary guides of machine learning research, now struggle to provide immediate insight into the latest breakthroughs. This is not the first time that empirical progress in machine learning has outpaced more theory-motivated approaches, yet the magnitude of recent advances has forced us to swallow the bitter pill of the “Bitter Lesson” yet again [1].</p>\n<p>This shift has prompted speculation about mathematics’ diminished role in machine learning research moving forward. It is already evident that mathematics will have to share the stage with a broader range of perspectives (for instance, biology which has deep experience drawing conclusions about irreducibly complex systems or the social sciences as AI is integrated ever more deeply into society). The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of machine learning should be welcomed as a positive development by all researchers.</p>\n<p>However, we argue that mathematics remains as relevant as ever; its role is simply evolving. For example, whereas mathematics might once have primarily provided theoretical guarantees on model performance, it may soon be more commonly used for post-hoc explanations of empirical phenomena observed in model training and performance–a role analogous to one that it plays in physics. Similarly, while mathematical intuition might once have guided the design of handcrafted features or architectural details at a granular level, its use may shift to higher-level design choices such as matching architecture to underlying task structure or data symmetries.</p>\n<p>None of this is completely new. Mathematics has always served multiple purposes in machine learning. After all, the translation equivariant convolutional neural network, which exemplifies the idea of architecture matching data symmetries mentioned above is now over 40 years old. What’s changing are the kinds of problems where mathematics will have the greatest impact and the ways it will most commonly be applied.</p>\n<p>An intriguing consequence of the shift towards scale is that it has broadened the scope of the fields of mathematics applicable to machine learning. “Pure” mathematical domains such as topology, algebra, and geometry, are now joining the more traditionally applied fields of probability theory, analysis, and linear algebra. These pure fields have grown and developed over the last century to handle high levels of abstraction and complexity, helping mathematicians make discoveries about spaces, algebraic objects, and combinatorial processes that at first glance seem beyond human intuition. These capabilities promise to address many of the biggest challenges in modern deep learning. </p>\n<p>In this article we will explore several areas of current research that demonstrate the enduring ability of mathematics to guide the process of discovery and understanding in machine learning.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Figure 1: Mathematics can illuminate the ways that ReLU-based neural networks shatter input space into countless polygonal regions, in each of which the model behaves like a linear map [2, 3, 4]. These decompositions create beautiful patterns. (Figure made with SplineCam [5]).</i>\n    </p>\n<h3>Describing an Elephant from a Pin Prick</h3>\n<p>Suppose you are given a 7 billion parameter neural network with 50 layers and are asked to analyze it; how would you begin? The standard procedure would be to calculate relevant performance statistics. For instance, the accuracy on a suite of evaluation benchmarks. In certain situations, this may be sufficient. However, deep learning models are complex and multifaceted. Two computer vision models with the same accuracy may have very different generalization properties to out-of-distribution data, calibration, adversarial robustness, and other “secondary statistics” that are critical in many real-world applications. Beyond this, all evidence suggests that to build a complete scientific understanding of deep learning, we will need to venture beyond evaluation scores. Indeed, just as it is impossible to capture all the dimensions of humanity with a single numerical quantity (e.g., IQ, height), trying to understand a model by one or even several statistics alone is fundamentally limiting.</p>\n<p>One difference between understanding a human and understanding a model is that we have easy access to all model parameters and all the individual computations that occur in a model. Indeed, by extracting a model’s hidden activations we can directly trace the process by which a model converts raw input into a prediction. Unfortunately, the world of hidden activations is far less hospitable than that of simple model performance statistics. Like the initial input, hidden activations are usually high dimensional, but unlike input data they are not structured in a form that humans can understand. If we venture into even higher dimensions, we can try to understand a model through its weights directly. Here, in the space of model weights, we have the freedom to move in millions to billions of orthogonal directions from a single starting point. How do we even begin to make sense of these worlds?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://thegradient.pub/shape-symmetry-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
