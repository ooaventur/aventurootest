So hats off to <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/topic/lola-young\">Lola Young</a> for owning her mixed feelings over the arcade game beat of “D£aler”, the third single from <i>I’m Only F***ing Myself. </i></p>\n    <p>This is the third LP in as many years from <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/lola-young-messy-royal-festival-hall-little-simz-meltdown-b2772255.html\">the 24-year-old pop-rocker </a>who hit the mainstream last year when her anthem “Messy” went viral on TikTok. Kylie Jenner was among the 250,000 people lip-synching along to the snaggy hook: “Cause I’m too messy, and then I’m too f***ing clean.”</p>\n    <p>The sound of <i>I’m Only F***ing Myself </i>continues that song’s chaotic theme, bouncing between the basement grunge of “F*** Everyone” and “CAN WE IGNORE IT :(” and the cleaner-cut pop of “One Thing” or “D£aler”. There’s an autumn leaves-on-the-pavement vibe to the way Young mixes up the bright red and golds of synths with the darker, sludgier guitar sounds. </p>\n    <p>The south Londoner embraces a proper melting pot of genres, vocally hopscotching from a ragged Cerys Matthews-style howl on the shoegazey “SPIDERS” to the Raye-indebted glottal-stopped semi-rap of “One Thing”, then to the sweet, vulnerable crooning of “Post Sex Clarity”. Over the muzzy electric strum of the latter, she tells her lover: “I want you to trickle right down my throat.”</p>\n    <p>The warning word “explicit” appears in brackets next to eight out of <i>I’m Only F***ing Myself’s </i>12 tracks. In a recent interview with <i>The Guardian</i>, Young explained that writing so openly about sex was her way of “masking” her emotions. “It’s kind of, this is my alter ego, the sex thing – but underneath it is pain and aggression and things I was going through that were more difficult,” she said. </p>\n    <p>So on the thrashy flip-off of “F*** Everyone”, her desire to “f*** guys/girls who don’t like me” feels like a cry for help, going one further than Raye’s “Escapism” with a third verse that goes: “I’ve been touching on your father, giving him head… right down in the gutter, blood on my knees ... and I don’t cry.” The hooks are grade A, but is it time for an intervention?</p>\n    <p>Perhaps not. Young faces down her monsters and demands we treat her as both the smartest, cutest and scariest creature in this hood. This album sees her take aim at the narcissistic ex of “Walk All Over You” who talks to her “like s*** on your shoes”. She brushes off the culturally constructed shame of only wanting “One Thing” from a lover (“men do it all the time”).</p>\n    <p>Some fans of Young’s poppier sounds might struggle with the more experimental clatter-crash of “CAN WE IGNORE IT :(” or the raw yowl of “SPIDERS”. But they’ll find safe harbour in the soulful cradles of “SAD SOB STORY :)”, on which she invites listeners to become friends by confiding details of an ex “so sick” that he “made me miss my best friend’s birthday”.</p>\n    <p>After all the mess of noise and sex and swearing, Young finishes with an acoustic number on which she describes taking prescription medication for the schizoaffective disorder she was diagnosed with as a teenager. This record’s greatest strengths (and weaknesses) lie in Young’s bold, blatant and occasionally bewildering commitment to being messy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/lola-young-review-only-fucking-myself-b2828921.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In 2001, he scored his first No 1 single with “Who I Am” performed by Jessica Andrews.</p>\n    <p>James would go on to write more than 300 songs in his career.

At the ceremony, hosted in 2021 due to the Covid pandemic, James said: “I want to thank the songwriting community and all my fellow songwriters. This award especially belongs to you.”</p>\n    <p>Tributes have since been paid to the star. ASCAP wrote on X/Twitter that James was a “trusted collaborator to country’s greatest names and a true advocate for songwriter”, adding: “We miss him dearly.”</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/19/7/21/GettyImages-1425727731.jpeg\" alt=\"The artist wrote more than 300 songs during his career\"/>\n    <p>Dierks Bentley, who worked with James on the 2013 hit “I Hold On”, wrote on Instagram: “Rest in peace, pal.

One of the best singer-songwriters in our town….total legend.”</p>\n    <p>Josh Gracin, who came fourth on <i>American Idol</i> in 2003, said that he had been lucky enough to work with James during the early stages of his career. “I was struggling to connect with the songs being pitched for my first record until I was introduced to Brett’s writing. I went on to cut five of his songs for that debut album, and he quickly transcended far beyond where we both started.”</p>\n    <p>Fellow country star Sara Evans wrote on Instagram: “I am absolutely devastated at the loss of one of the best writers I’ve ever written with and recorded several of his songs. Brett James. I’m praying for his loved ones. What a tragic and sad day.

    "body": "<h3>Anna Bruno Considers the Largely Unexplored Humorous Landscape of Catholicism in Literary Fiction</h3>\n<p>My first apartment after college was a four-bedroom in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood that I shared with three guys. We were all in our early twenties, trying to make it on our own for the first time. I worked in PR; Brian worked in advertising; Ryan was an architect; and Chris was a consultant. I considered them all my drinking buddies, but, of the three, Chris seemed the most familiar to me, in that way a sister looks at her brother and sees her own image reflected back in a funny mirror.</p>\n<p>One night, early in our friendship, Chris and I came home from the bar and bonded over the question of who was more Catholic. He went down to his room (the bedrooms were downstairs and the kitchen and living room were upstairs—a fleabag with a nice view from the top). When he returned, he produced a picture of Pope John Paul II. He told me to flip it over. The message on the back, in his mom’s handwriting, read, “For your Bible.”</p>\n<p>I wonder if writers, who also happen to be Catholic, would be more humane if they could find some humor in their tradition.</p>\n<p>Chris did not have a Bible. His life, as I understood it, was entirely secular. Furthermore, John Paul II was no longer pope when Chris received that picture. He had died earlier that year (2005) and Pope Benedict had taken over. But Benedict was no John Paul II, and sales of his image at Catholic novelty shops were probably sluggish.</p>\n<p>Chris kept the picture, not because he loved his mother, though he did very much, but because he saw humor in her gesture. I looked up from the image of the pontiff in his white cassock and zucchetto, cracked a smile, and told Chris that he won: He was more Catholic.</p>\n<p>I’m reminded of this moment whenever I hear John Mulaney speak about his time as an altar boy, or Conan O’Brien insist that he is Catholic “in his bones.” Or when Stephen Colbert talks about his enormous Catholic family. Of the three, Colbert is the only one still practicing, but they are all equally Catholic in their identities, and they frequently mine their childhoods and relationships with their families for jokes. I’m certain all three of them would have nodded knowingly if they were there that night in our grubby apartment, when Chris brought out the Pope’s picture.</p>\n<p>But somehow, I’ve never found this particular identity, which translates so well to comedy, represented in literary fiction. To figure out why, I picked up the essay collection <i>The Novel, Spirituality and Modern Culture</i>. I was interested in Donna Tartt’s thoughts on being Catholic and a famous literary writer. For Tartt, writing and religion operate in separate registers, a perspective that is borne out in her work. She argues, </p>\n<p>Writers are entertainers. Basically, we all lie for a living—and any novelist who feels too puffed up with the spiritual importance and nobility of his work would do well to consider whether he would not be serving humanity far better by opening up a soup kitchen or working among the homeless. But the play-acting and mischief of story-telling can also be a vehicle for getting in touch with the deepest and most serious spiritual truths—truths of fate and coincidence, or suffering and justice, of life and death.</p>\n<p>Another essay in the collection, written by Sarah Maitland, is more exacting. After reading a review that concluded her work was “not a novel for atheists,” Maitland thought, “…what do you think we theists have been reading for the last 200 years? We have had to consume an unmitigated diet of post-Enlightenment bourgeois humanism, if we wish to read novels at all.” The issue, as Maitland states earlier in the essay, is that “There is seldom any mention, and never any examination, of people who are religious some of the time, or whose aspirations to faith are some part of a ‘whole’ life (which may also include adultery, divorce, questioning their sexuality, attending psychological counselling and the whole range of other activities that novels’ characters usually engage in).”</p>\n<p>Maitland and Tartt both come from Christian traditions, but the collection, at least in title, is about spirituality and modern culture, generally, so it’s curious that they don’t address the elephant in the room, which is that there is something particular about Christianity that literary novelists avoid.</p>\n<p><i>Fleishman is in Trouble</i> explores casual Jewishness, what Taffy Brodesser-Akner describes as waking up and going to work as a Jewish person, without leaving Orthodoxy, or becoming Orthodox, or worrying about anti-Semitism. In other words, Brodesser-Akner wrote the kind of novel that Maitland seeks, with characters who are, “religious some of the time.” Dani Shapiro’s <i>Signal Fires</i> is a meditation on human connectedness that feels transcendental. In <i>Martyr!</i>, Kaveh Akbar manages to find God in a flickering light bulb. These authors include religious practice and philosophical musings without the embarrassment of their Catholic literary contemporaries. Perhaps this is because American Christian identity is defined by belief rather than inheritance. Or maybe American novelists avoid writing about Catholicism because people like Harrison Butker make it seem so lame?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://lithub.com/christianity-and-comedy-on-finding-the-funny-side-of-faith/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It was ironic, then, that the inaugural edition of Untitled Art, Houston was small—at least in comparison to the fair’s Miami Beach counterpart, which is roughly two times the size. Still, the 88 galleries who showed at the Houston fair made this event feel mighty, despite its size.</p>\n    <p>There was space for memorable installations by artists such as Mel Chin and Isabelle Brourman; equally memorable booths were located. And there were also noteworthy works dealing head-on with pressing political issues in a time when addressing topics like the healthcare crisis vis-à-vis the Luigi Mangione trials and immigration between the United States and Mexico can be risky for both artists and dealers.</p>\n    <p>Houston newcomers and locals alike from near and far, and there was an excitement among the attendees here that has been rare since the start of the Covid pandemic. Talk of a market downturn seemed not to deter visitors from drinking in the Southern hospitality and the daring selection of works in multiple mediums.</p>\n    <p>Despite the extravagance of the event, I was drawn to some of the fair’s quietest works. Here are a few that stood out.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t<h2>Shuling Guo at Laura (The Gallery)</h2><graphic width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-artnews-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Shuling Guo at Laura (The Gallery), Untitled Art, Houston, 2025.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2031.jpeg?w=400\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2031.jpeg 4032w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2031.jpeg?resize=400,300 400w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Image Credit: Photo Francesca Aton, ARTnews</figcaption><p class=\"paragraph larva // a-font-body-m     \">The ethereal glow of Chinese-born, Philadelphia-based artist Shuling Guo’s oil on linen paintings are inspired by her time living at sea and the birth of her daughter in 2022. One painting even seems to refer to the latter directly: a flame gives way to what looks either like a butterfly or a female reproductive system. These transcendent works recall mystical painters like Hilma af Klint and Agnes Pelton. The small scale of the works only adds to their intimacy and their otherworldliness.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t<h2>Gillian Brett at Don’t Look Projects</h2><graphic width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-artnews-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Gillian Brett at Don’t Look Projects, Untitled Art, Houston, 2025.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2017.jpeg?w=400\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2017.jpeg 4032w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2017.jpeg?resize=400,300 400w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Image Credit: Photo Francesca Aton, ARTnews</figcaption><p class=\"paragraph larva // a-font-body-m     \">At first glance, plants appear to grow out of the wall of this booth. Upon further inspection, however, one begins to notice that these plants are comprised of computer circuitry and wire cables. The work cleverly intertwines concerns about modern agriculture practices and climate change, showing how human reliance on technology has reshaped the natural world for the worse. Images of the night sky captured by the Hubble telescope also appear here on fractured LCD screens that disturb their beauty.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t<h2>Jamal Cyrus at Inman Gallery</h2><graphic width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-artnews-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Jamal Cyrus at Inman Gallery, Untitled Art, Houston, 2025.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2013.jpeg?w=400\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2013.jpeg 4032w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2013.jpeg?resize=400,300 400w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Image Credit: Francesca Aton/ARTnews</figcaption><p class=\"paragraph larva // a-font-body-m     \">Drawing on the storied tradition of quilt-making within Black American culture, Jamal Cyrus layers pieces of denim jeans marked with phrases and symbols that speak to present-day experiences and concerns from the</p><strong/>demarcation of one’s breathing to the hum of a song. Others hint at the joy and sorrow encapsulated in music, as they appear to have been turned into instruments ready to be played—however impractical they may be.<i>Rhombus or Humming Song (2-5-1)</i>, 2025, for instance, is a small bronze, wood, and brass sculpture that has been turned into a tambourine.</li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t<h2>Taisiia Cherkasova at Lazy Mike Gallery</h2><graphic width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-artnews-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Taisiia Cherkasova at Lazy Mike Gallery, Untitled Art, Houston, 2025.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2025.jpeg?w=400\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2025.jpeg 4032w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2025.jpeg?resize=400,300 400w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Image Credit: Francesca Aton/ARTnews</figcaption><p class=\"paragraph larva // a-font-body-m     \">The best laid plans can often go awry, and Lazy Mike Gallery found out the hard way. The gallery had planned to show a collaborative project by Taisiia Cherkasova, who has been corresponding with a childhood friend living in war-torn Ukraine who was drafted into the armed forces. The gallery had planned to show this exchange in the form of images skyscapes and landscapes, but the works got stuck in customs and did not make it to the fair in time. Instead, Cherkasova pivoted, creating related postcard-sized works to the originals she could not exhibit.</p></li>\n      <li>\n\t\t\t<h2>Verónica Gaona at Keijsers Koning</h2><graphic width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-artnews-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Verónica Gaona at Keijsers Koning, Untitled Art, Houston, 2025.\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2029.jpeg?w=400\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2029.jpeg 4032w, https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2029.jpeg?resize=400,300 400w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px\"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Image Credit: Francesca Aton/ARTnews</figcaption><p class=\"paragraph larva // a-font-body-m     \">For these sculptures, Verónica Gaona salvaged metal from large Ford F150 trucks, causing all the scraps to look like crumbled pieces of paper when hung in the booth of Keijsers Koning. (Disclosure: I previously worked at the gallery when it was known as LMAK.) These cast-aside pieces of detritus were collected along the Rio Grande River and are here collaged with personal photographs of the artist’s family and friends. Mapping oneself and one’s family directly onto the surface of discarded trucks draws out issues related to migration between the United States and Mexico—a particularly haunting topic in Texas, given its location along the United States-Mexico border.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/list/art-news/news/best-booths-untitled-art-houston-1234752768/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Qin Shihuang, founder of the Qin dynasty and the first emperor of a unified China, is said to have used the labor of 300,000 soldiers and 500,000 civilians.

Photo by Kevin Frayer / Getty Images.</p></div>\n<p>Due in part to an absence of written sources on the subject, the construction process for the Great Wall of China remains poorly understood as well. We do, however, know that the builders used a <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/XQWhK0k_ZKq6Ug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quality control system</a> where the names of commanding officers, kiln makers, and other essential workers were carved into bricks. That way, if the work proved shoddy, one could easily figure out who was to blame.</p>\n<p>We also know that the workforce were divided into three groups: soldiers, civilians, and prisoners. The amount of <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/how-was-the-great-wall-built-simatai-great-wall-tourist-area/xwWRR5eX6exH1g?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prison labor</a> used varied from dynasty to dynasty, depending on legislation. The Qin and Han dynasties, keen on this type of employment, instated forced labor as punishment for a variety of offenses both minor and major.</p>\n<p>The wall’s total cost is similarly difficult to ascertain. The Ming dynasty, which constructed approximately 5,500 miles over the course of their roughly three-century-long reign, is thought to have <a href=\"https://www.travelchinaguide.com/construction-of-great-wall-of-china-cost.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spent</a> the equivalent of $95 billion.</p>\n<h4><strong>Recent Discoveries</strong></h4>\n<div id=\"attachment_2678987\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-1024x695.jpg\" alt=\"Researcher climbs crumbling stone ruins with drawing board on back under clear blue sky.\" srcset=\"https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-300x204.jpg 300w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-768x521.jpg 768w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-1536x1042.jpg 1536w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-50x34.jpg 50w, https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2025/08/great-wall-of-china-destoyed-2006-1920x1303.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-2678987\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A worker from the Chinese cultural relic department surveying a collapsed sector of the Great Wall of China in Beijing, 2006.

    "body": "<h2>Sarah McLachlan launched Lilith Fair out of frustration with the male-dominated music industry — and it quickly sold out venues across the U.S. and Canada.</h2>\n<p>Jason Philbrook/Wikimedia CommonsLilith Fair ran for three consecutive years in the 1990s and featured all female artists.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair, a touring music festival that traveled across the United States and Canada for three summers between 1997 and 1999, was similar to other festivals in many regards. There were massive crowds, multiple stages, and artists who ranged from world-famous to virtually unheard of.</p>\n<p>However, there was one aspect of Lilith Fair that was incredibly unique: Every single performer was a woman.</p>\n<p>The all-female festival made waves at a time when music industry executives didn’t believe that female artists could sell tickets. In fact, Canadian singer Sarah McLachlan came up with the idea for Lilith Fair after she was told that concert lineups and radio stations wouldn’t feature two women back-to-back because it wasn’t profitable.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair quickly proved these assumptions wrong. It was the top-grossing touring festival in 1997, selling out most of its venues. And over its three-year run, it brought in tens of millions of dollars and launched the careers of women who went on to become some of the biggest names in the music industry.</p>\n<h2>The Spiteful Origins Of Lilith Fair</h2>\n<p>Sarah McLachlan conceived the idea of Lilith Fair in 1996 after she became frustrated with sexism in the entertainment industry. Executives told her that more than one female headliner wasn’t good for ticket sales, even after she’d sold more than 2.8 million albums.</p>\n<p>Doug Wilson / Alamy Stock PhotoThe massive crowd at Lilith Fair during its stop at the Gorge in Washington State. 1997.</p>\n<p>As McLachlan told <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/07/05/1108635464/25-years-on-lilith-fair-is-a-reminder-of-how-one-womans-radical-idea-changed-mus\">NPR</a> in 2022, “I’d walk in and do an interview and they said, ‘Well, we’d love to add this song but we can’t add you this week because we had a Tori Amos or because we added Tracy Chapman or because we added Sinéad O’Connor. And it was extremely frustrating.”</p>\n<p>“So the beginning of this was just born out of the desire to come together as a community,” McLachlan continued. “And it became this — we’re going to break down some barriers. We’re going to prove these guys wrong.”</p>\n<p>McLachlan knew her experience wasn’t isolated, so she brought together dozens of other female bands and performers to put on a festival that would show that women could sell tickets — millions of them.</p>\n<p>McLachlan and her co-organizers chose a name fitting of a festival born out of resistance. It was called Lilith Fair after the mythological figure who was said to be Adam’s first wife but refused to submit to him.</p>\n<p>Public DomainJohn Collier’s 1887 painting of Lilith, the rebellious woman after which Lilith Fair was named.</p>\n<p>The first year was a smashing success. Lilith Fair sold out almost every single show and brought in over $16 million, becoming the top-earning touring festival and even beating out Lollapalooza in ticket sales and crowd sizes.</p>\n<p>Lilith Fair visited 37 cities in its first year, with its main stage acts including artists like Fiona Apple, Tracy Chapman, Sheryl Crow, the Indigo Girls, and Jewel. It was so successful that organizers decided to run it again the following year. But despite the festival’s accomplishments, it still faced plenty of criticism.</p>\n<h2>The Return Of The Groundbreaking Festival</h2>\n<p>Lilith Fair quickly became a target for misogynistic comments, as well as some not-so-tactful jokes. It was dubbed “Lesbopalooza,” and the artists who performed onstage were called out for their “mom music.”</p>\n<p>However, amongst the tasteless remarks were legitimate critiques, like how the ’97 lineup lacked diversity. So, organizers worked to increase the number of artists of color for the ’98 tour, securing singers like Queen Latifah, Erykah Badu, and Missy Elliot.</p>\n<p>In fact, Lilith Fair marked Missy Elliot’s first live performance. The festival also furthered the careers of up-and-coming artists like Dido, Nelly Furtado, and Christina Aguilera.</p>\n<p>HollenbeckTAH/Wikimedia CommonsElisabeth Carlisle and Meredith Brooks onstage at Lilith Fair 1999.</p>\n<p>The women who were part of Lilith Fair knew that it was something special. Meshell Ndegeocello, who was part of the 1998 lineup, told NPR, “I was able to see people I admired but cherished in a way that had a musical connection to me that was uplifting and healing. And I think I flourished as a musician because I was out of the male gaze.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lilith Fair’s third run in 1999 would be the festival’s last until its brief 2010 revival. It wasn’t for a lack of success — McLachlan was simply exhausted. Several big milestones were happening in both her personal and professional lives: She got married, released albums, and was getting ready to go on her own tour. She simply no longer had the time to put Lilith Fair together.</p>\n<p>However, the festival’s legacy endured, both for the fans who attended and the artists who performed.</p>\n<h2>Lilith Fair Still Serves As An Inspiration Today</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/lilith-fair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Ilove​ Gertrude Stein but I find it very difficult to think about the way I love her, to be precise about what’s so charming and also valuable in her writing, because everywhere you look there is her image and it can monopolise the attention. Not that I don’t love her image too. The problem is in working out what’s important, the image or the work or the way of living – or even whether these can be or should be separated out at all. Often she is pictured as part of a couple, usually with her partner, Alice B. Toklas, hovering watchfully in the background, or with one of her poodles, but sometimes she is simply herself: a presence in brown corduroy. Or there is the famous portrait by Picasso from 1905, with the face he added in later, not so much a face as a mask, and her joke about it, in Toklas’s voice: ‘After a little while I murmured to Picasso that I liked his portrait of Gertrude Stein. Yes, he said, everybody says that she does not look like it but that does not make any difference, she will, he said.’ She made many jokes, in fact: Stein’s are perhaps the only modernist works that make you laugh. I don’t mean laughing at them, which is what most people did with Stein. She became a kind of clown princess, which is unfair, but then almost all the attention directed at Stein has been unfair or misplaced, even from her admirers. It’s as if her brilliance is always quivering and in doubt, something that exists only in an endless process of attack or defence, which can make trying to think about her very tiring.</p>\n<p>One thing I am sure of is her value, even if the map of literary history that displays her influence seems very local, mostly confined to the New York poetry of John Ashbery and Frank O’Hara or the writing of Andy Warhol, though in fact so much of Hemingway’s manner of writing – the short, paratactic sentences, the use of repetition, the idea of removing the obvious subject – was taken from her, so the whole sequence of writers that came out of Hemingway’s style is arguably Steinian. But this occlusion shouldn’t be so surprising, because it took Stein herself a long time to catch up with her writing, to work out how to use her intuitions.</p>\n<p>She was born in 1874, which makes her one of the oldest modernists, and unusually for the modernists her greatest works were made in the last decade or so of her life, in the 1930s and early 1940s. The best is also the most famous, <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, the only book of hers that actually sold, but I think those that followed it – <i>Picasso</i>, <i>Paris France</i>, <i>Wars I Have Seen</i> – are wonderful too. Of course, I also love her more far-out earlier works, like <i>Tender Buttons</i> (1914) and the prose portraits and also many of the lectures, but not everything, not at all – one achievement of a true reading of Stein would be an assessment of how uneven she is as a writer – and the works I love exist for me more as a kind of abstract pattern, like some grammatical primer which acquires a graver beauty when finally submitted to the weight of the world. In a note Toklas wrote to Stein after typing up one of her manuscripts, she said: ‘It’s such very orderly literature. Much more so than Pablo’s. <i>La Jolie</i> is quite messy compared to this. You never were messy lovie but it’s more crowded now &amp; I like it. You can almost say anything you please can’t you.’ That note is much more insightful than most of what has passed for criticism of Stein in the last century, in its vocabulary of the ‘orderly’ and the ‘messy’ and the ‘crowded’, and that final sense of liberation. Because one delight of Stein’s way of writing is the way she explored what it might mean to speak with impunity – unpoliced and malicious and exuberant.</p>\n<p>Another delight is her openness about the conditions of domestic intimacy in which art is created. In <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, Stein has Toklas say: ‘You cannot tell what a picture really is or what an object really is until you dust it every day and you cannot tell what a book is until you type it or proofread it. It then does something to you that only reading never can do.’ I suppose you could irritably dismiss this kind of observation as the caprice of a rich collector, someone with their own private MoMA, but in fact it’s ruthless and original in its sense of pleasure as minute and daily and careful, just as this little observation about Matisse is so precisely poised: ‘He used his distorted drawing as a dissonance is used in music or as vinegar or lemons are used in cooking or egg shells in coffee to clarify. I do inevitably take my comparisons from the kitchen because I like food and cooking and know something about it.’</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/adam-thirlwell/devotion-to-the-cut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>At two o’clock​ in the morning on 23 October 1731, ‘a great smoak’ began to pour from the rafters of Ashburnham House in Westminster. The library was on fire, which meant that English history was on fire. Ashburnham held the many rare manuscripts that had been donated to the nation by the antiquarian Robert Cotton, as well as the treasures of the royal manuscript collections. The flames from a fireplace had caught on the wooden mantelpiece and spread to the wainscoting. Hapless librarians were throwing water on the blaze; the city fire engines were nowhere to be seen. Eventually Mr Casley, the deputy librarian, dashed out of the building cradling the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>, a fifth-century Greek Bible. Others remained, throwing books out of the windows as fast as they could. The next day, with Ashburnham in ruins, boys from Westminster School were picking up charred manuscript fragments as souvenirs.</p>\n<p>There were almost a thousand manuscripts in the collection, organised into a series of ‘presses’ or shelving units, each one taking its name from the bust of a Roman emperor that stood on top. Vitellius A.xv, the only copy of <i>Beowulf</i>, was scorched and damaged. Otho A.xii, a unique exemplar of the Old English poem <i>The Battle of Maldon</i>, was completely destroyed. Another volume pressed with Otho, an eighth-century Northumbrian Gospel, was mostly gone; the cataloguers remarked hopefully that ‘Some Pieces of the Leaves of this old Book are preserv’d.’ In many cases, the fat from the lambskin vellum had been drawn out by the heat, so that the pages were roasted in their own juices. One unsalvageable codex, in the words of a modern librarian, resembles ‘an irradiated armadillo’. Though conservation efforts succeeded with a good number of the manuscripts, about a fifth of the collection was deemed to have been ‘lost, burned, or entirely spoiled’.</p>\n<p>None of the manuscripts in the Nero press was harmed. Among them was the most mysterious volume of medieval English literature. Cotton Nero A.x is a small miracle: a quarto volume, about the size of a paperback, consisting of just 92 leaves. It contains four untitled English poems – 20th-century editors named them <i>Pearl</i>, <i>Cleanness</i>, <i>Patience</i> and <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> – written in the alliterative style in a dialect of the West Midlands. The first and last of these poems are among the greatest poetic works written in Middle English. The author is unknown, the patron is unknown, the original owners of the manuscript are unknown. All we do know is that Cotton acquired the volume from another antiquary, Henry Savile, in the late 16th century. It contains twelve bizarre illustrations, added by another anonymous individual some time after the texts were completed. The Pearl Manuscript, as it is usually called, is the only surviving anthology of alliterative poetry, and the sole exemplar of the poems it contains.</p>\n<p>There is no getting around the weirdness. We don’t really know what it is or what it was for. In his new study of the manuscript, Arthur Bahr embraces the mystery, spiritedly chasing after a book that will never let us catch up. He suggests that it is ‘a pedagogical compilation’, cleverly designed to provoke readers into reflecting on the limits and possibilities of meaning-making itself. It is not ineffable but ‘supereffable’, proliferating interpretations over the centuries. He has spent years wrestling with the damn thing and is still deeply in love with it: the book is dedicated ‘to the makers of the Pearl Manuscript’.</p>\n<p>In <i>Pearl</i>, the narrator is beset with grief for a two-year-old child, his precious Pearl (the Latin for ‘pearl’ is <i>margarita</i>, leading many commentators to assume that the child’s name was Margery or Margaret). He can’t even bring himself to say that she was his daughter, just that she was closer ‘than aunt or niece’. He is obsessed with his loss and has come to visit her grave. ‘Allas! I leste hyr in on erbere [a grassy plot]/My privy perle withouten spotte.’ The burial mound is covered with aromatic flowers and he can’t avoid the thought that their sweet scents have sprung from her mouldering body. Overcome by sadness and the odours of the flowers, he falls into a reverie, waking to find himself in paradise. There, just across a stream, he spies a beautiful girl: ‘I knew hyr wel, I hade sen hyr ere.’ He is overcome with joy at seeing his Pearl again, but feels more intensely than ever the pain of their remaining apart. The maiden rebukes him on both counts: he can’t stay in paradise, and in any case, he is foolish for grieving something so fleeting as human life, compared to the everlasting joy of heaven.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v47/n17/tom-johnson/supereffable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Naive and ruthlessly ambitious, they brave the skeptics, the losers, the people too good to talk to them and the people who don’t take them seriously. Eventually, inevitably, their genius – obvious, unsinkable, perhaps diabolical – collides with opportunity. Voilà! An origin story is born.</p>\n    <p>Swap out the date and the city, and this would describe a pivotal scene in any number of recent movies and TV shows that take cinematic interest in the self-mythology of entrepreneurs. The dramatic logic and iconography of the origin story, basically true but always highly glossed, is by now so recognizable it almost writes itself: initial rejection, dogged persistence, chance meeting, lightbulb moment, big break. We’ve seen it in a wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/31/in-business-how-brands-like-nike-blackberry-and-pop-tarts-became-films-hottest-stars\">brand backstory movies</a> – Flamin’ Hot, Air, BlackBerry and Tetris to name a few – as well as the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/31/wecrashed-hustle-harder-tv-workism\">boomlet of shows depicting 2010s hustle culture</a>. The twist with Swiped, Hulu’s new film on the founding of online dating titans Tinder and Bumble, is that this founder is a woman.</p>\n    <p>And it is quite a twist – the route Whitney Wolfe Herd (Lily James) takes to becoming the youngest self-made female billionaire is much rougher than that of her male peers, consistently potholed with misogyny, from standard-grade office sexism to sexual harassment and online slander. Swiped, directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg (Unpregnant) from her script with Jennifer Gibgot and Andrew Panay, oscillates between acknowledgment of the tech world’s – and, for that matter, the internet’s – inherent misogyny, with a light, by-the-numbers portrait of a capitalist success. Characters speak in startup pablum and punchy slogans. “Bill Gates cured polio – or malaria, or something. But you know what he did first? He made $100bn,” incubator head Sean Rad (Ben Schnetzer) tells Whitney when she presents her initial idea for an app to connect volunteers with charities. She’s summarily hired as the head of marketing for one of Sean’s apps which, as multiple office characters note, needs 1 million users in the first year to stand a chance.</p>\n    <p>All of this breezes by with little friction and a rose-tinted glow that feels a little odd for an app that so fundamentally changed how young people think about sex, dating and relationships writ large. In one scene that made me laugh out loud for its Big Game Energy at a conference table, Whitney scrambles out of the pocket and scores a touchdown with the name <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tinder\">Tinder</a> (as opposed to, say, Matchbox). In another, Whitney, a preternatural marketing genius from Salt Lake City, pits sorority girl insecurities against male lust at Southern Methodist University and kills the future of IRL dating in five movie minutes.</p>\n    <p>These scenes are neither offensive nor particularly inspiring (beyond some Wikipedia searches), and proceed competently and dutifully, a smooth dose of 2010s lore with the soundtrack, highlights and leggings to match. Where Swiped grabs attention, and complicates an otherwise straightforward success narrative, is in depicting the genuinely appalling treatment of Wolfe Herd by her male co-workers. A months-long romance with Justin (Jackson White, believably sinister) quickly turns toxic; Goldenberg and James, suitably disappearing into fried blond highlights and an angular American accent, bring us into Whitney’s addled, righteous anger – the disparaging and constant text message harassment, the confusion over how to handle a fellow co-founder’s abuse as the only woman in the room, her shocked betrayal when they close ranks, fire her and lock her in with an NDA. (Their side still went public, subjecting her to a firestorm of online harassment evocatively portrayed in a swirling montage of booze and tweets.)</p>\n    <p>Swiped especially shines in its willingness to challenge its protagonist, predominantly through her co-worker turned best friend Tisha, a would-be Black best friend character if not for Industry’s Myha’la landing some punches on Whitney for pulling up the ladder behind her and dismissing harassment until it came for her. Same for Whitney’s working relationship with the dubious billionaire Andrey Andreev (Dan Stevens, doing a ridiculous, but I have to imagine researched, Russian accent), who gave her carte blanche funding to start Bumble, the women-centered dating app built to correct Tinder’s bro-y mistakes, while committing his own #MeToo sins. It’s a shame, then, that the film ultimately returns to credulous adulation for succeeding in this system; I’m not sure the grace note of Wolfe Herd getting permission from the Blackstone guy who just bought her company to stay on as CEO is the victory note the film-makers think it is.</p>\n    <p>Still, the history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swiped’s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it. You, as I, may have some reservations about another business movie as well as dating – but we’re here now, so swipe right.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Swiped is available on Hulu in the US on 19 September and Disney+ elsewhere</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/18/swiped-review-tinder-bumble-movie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>“What was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest\">Kanye West</a> thinking?”<i> </i>has remained a prevailing question since the Grammy award-winning rapper-producer pulled the rip cord on his spectacular descent into rightwing nihilism more than a decade ago. In Whose Name?, a cinéma vérité take on the tortured musical genius (who goes by just Ye now), offers fans and long-term observers a new artifact to pore over in search of answers – and reason to be disappointed all over again.</p>\n    <p>That’s not a knock on the 104-minute opus, an outcropping of more than 3,000 hours of footage – some of it never before seen, some of it a reverse perspective on the viral stunts and rants that have marked Ye’s dramatic nosedive. Director Nico Ballesteros – who started filming in 2018, at age 18, with nothing to recommend him (his stint as a second assistant director on a Jesus Is King concert video came later) – had sweeping access to Ye and made the distinctive choice not to layer it with any talking-head commentary for context. Mostly, he turns on the camera, holds a tight focus on his subject and lets the rest drift in and out of frame.</p>\n    <p>The laissez-faire approach, which benefits from having an artistic savant on the opposite end of the lens, would seem to owe less to Ballesteros’s relative inexperience than to the fact that Ye simply cannot suffer anything that might push back on his self-assured worldview; that’s even as Ye confirms, on camera and without hint of irony, what many have suspected for years: that he’s gone off his meds. (In fact, he regards the documentary as a kind of mental-wellness exercise that could someday be a salve to the masses or, failing that, play at his funeral.) In one ridealong scene with Ballesteros, Ye confesses to having bipolar disorder while in cat-face makeup for the Fade music video – a bewildering moment of self-awareness.</p>\n    <p>Where another self-important person can’t take no for answer, Ye literally cannot hear the word without having an explosive tantrum or perceiving even the slightest differences of opinion as part of some sinister effort to control his mind. “I would rather be dead than on medication,” he rages at Kris Jenner. In the doc, we see him use his mental health as a weapon to disentangle himself from a billion-dollar business portfolio that he nonetheless views as exploitative of him.</p>\n    <p>This visceral need to always be right goes a long way to explaining why the many public figures in Ye’s orbit were initially hesitant to push back against his antisemitic and white-supremacist rants. Swizz Beatz is the exceptional peer who actually confronts Ye about his controversial embrace of the Maga movement and the damage it threatens to the very communities who supported his rise to the top of the charts. (On the other hand, there’s Chris Rock likening Ye’s decision to wear a Maga hat on SNL to Sinéad O’Connor ripping up a picture of the pope. ) Ballesteros was a fly on the wall for Ye’s 2018 SNL performance, which entailed Ye going off on a curtain-dropping rant about the show using Black talent to ridicule Black luminaries; the broadside was especially personal for head writer Michael Che – whom, the doc shows, sat down with Ye before the show to establish some punchline boundaries, only for the rapper to launch into a rant about slavery. “You’re a hero to us, but what you did was fucked up,” Che says before SNL producer Lindsay Shookus shuts Ballesteros down. (“This isn’t good for us,” she says.)</p>\n    <p>Slavery is a stubborn theme of Ye’s rants. He sees it at the core of every corporate relationship, no matter how well the slave in question might be compensated. He tells Kim Kardashian that the E Network, the former home of her long-running reality TV show, is her “slave ship”. (It’s one of several alarming scenes between the formerly married couple that lay the groundwork for their eventual divorce.) Ye is so persistent about labeling everyone he encounters as some stripe of capitalist puppet that he can scarcely appreciate the extent to which the far right has made him into their personal mascot. “Culture will always be upstream from politics,” Candace Owens tells Ye during a visit to his Calabasas headquarters with Charlie Kirk. “Whoever can control culture can control politics.”</p>\n    <p>The longer Ballesteros’s doc went on, the more I found myself harkening to the way it began: with Ye on tour with Lady Gaga as part of the rollout for Graduation, just before his Taylor Swift moment at the MTV Video Music Awards set the stage for his villain arc. It was a refreshing reminder of who Ye once was: a totally unlikely pop star whose transcendent music spoke to a generation of poor and middle-class strivers. And while In Whose Name?, the most compelling of the Ye career autopsies by far, offers a more complete picture of where and how it all went so wrong, it doesn’t leave you feeling any less frustrated with the few new answers it manages to get.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">In Whose Name? is out in US cinemas on 19 September and elsewhere at a later date</p></li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/18/in-whose-name-review-kanye-west\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The shorter days and early darkness often cast a spell, encouraging us to spend more time indoors and chip away at our to-be-read piles. These 12 new and forthcoming art books are well worth adding to that list, offering insights into the decades-long practice of Nayland Blake, the curatorial vision of the late Okwui Enwezor, the artistic life of Louise Bourgeois, and more topics we’re eager to explore. We’re also keeping an eye out for other upcoming releases, including <i> Native Visual Sovereignty: A Reader on Art and Performance</i> (Dancing Foxes Press, November 11); Brandon Taylor’s novel </p>\n<p><i>(Riverhead Books, October 14); and innumerable others.

This anthology of his essays forms the foundations of understanding his complex ideas that shifted discourse to a more global perspective that has been slowly decentering the West to give a more accurate picture of art today. </p>\n<p>The first volume focuses on his earlier writings that mark his desire to renew African art discourse to rewrite histories. The second volume of this two-volume set starts in 2006 and charts a time when his influence was at its zenith.</p>\n<p>Taken from us far too early, Enwezor’s writings are indispensable tools for those who want to continue the important work of reformulating the world of art with justice and equity in mind. —<i>Hrag Vartanian</i></p>\n<p>Buy <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/bookshop.org/a/539/\">Volume 1</a> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781478031567\">Volume 1</a> on Bookshop | Duke University Press, August 5, 2025</p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to finally getting my hands on <i>Frank S. Matsura: Iconoclast Photographer of the American West</i> by Michael Holloman, editor, with portraits by and essays about the life and work of an early 20th-century Japanese photographer in a small western town. The spirited community captured by Matsura counters endless assumptions and misrepresentations propagated in American art and literature about the “real” West. I grew up in rural Montana, with Blackfeet siblings and a Japanese-American godfather who also grew up in Montana; finding out about Matsura felt both familiar and significant in rewriting tired Western tropes. Matsura came to Seattle from Japan in 1901 before settling in the small town of Okanogan, Washington, where he set up shop as a photographer of his friends and neighbors, many of whom were Sylix (Okanagan). Matsura’s lively portraits offer an instructive counterpoint to Edward S. Curtis’s better-known (for now) somber, ethnographic takes on Native life and people. —<i>Bridget Quinn</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781797232812\">Buy on Bookshop</a> | Princeton Architectural Press, September 9, 2025</p>\n<p>It’s easy to understand the enduring fascination with the aristocratic Mitford sisters, six 20th-century British siblings who grew up to live starkly different lives. One became a fascist and befriended Adolf Hitler, while another joined the communist party, and still a third penned numerous novels. They were even the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23856916/\">mediocre BritBox show</a> earlier this year. In <i>Do Admit!: The Mitford Sisters and Me</i>, however, cartoonist Mimi Pond illuminates their lives anew with her impeccable visual style and playful sensibility. A few pages in, I’m already hooked. —<i>LA</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781770468047\">Buy on Bookshop</a> | Drawn &amp; Quarterly, September 16, 2025</p>\n<p>While Robert Rauschenberg is best known for his “combine” paintings that blend sculpture and painting, photography has always been central to the Pop artist’s work. This small show brings together some of the photo-based work as well as their related paintings and larger format works, while highlighting for us that his eye for the overlooked and at first seemingly banal urbanscapes is central to his art making.</p>\n<p>Like his life partner, Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg helped chart new realities for queer artists who were far more marginalized up until then. This book is a celebration of one part of an artist’s practice that is finally getting the attention it deserves. —<i>HV</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781917273091\">Pre-order on Bookshop</a> | Giles, September 30, 2025</p>\n<p>Marie-Laure Bernadac started writing this biography of Louise Bourgeois as a way to mourn her passing in 2010. Not an easy task — the artist kept extensive journals, and threw absolutely nothing away. Translator Lauren Elkin points out that she wrote in a mix of French and English — sometimes in the same sentence.</p>\n<p>The result is a hefty, densely researched tome that quotes liberally from Bourgeois herself, as well as reproduces family photos and artworks, some in color. Bernadac conducted research at the Easton Foundation, which holds the artist’s archive, even sleeping there on occasion. It’s housed adjacent to the artist’s townhouse, with a mirrored layout  — which feels somehow fitting given Bourgeois’s obsession with domestic space as psychic theater. —<i>Lisa Yin Zhang</i></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.org/a/539/9780300268300\">Pre-order on Bookshop</a> | Yale University Press, October 14, 2025</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/1043154/12-art-books-to-read-this-fall-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

New York Fire Department (FDNY) officials said they believe the building was unoccupied at the time. Two firefighters sustained minor injuries.</p>\n    <p>By the morning, part of the roof and the fourth floor had collapsed, and Van Brunt Street had flooded out.

The four-story commercial building contains dozens of artist studios and high-end design businesses and is home to the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition (BWAC), a 400-member, artist-run nonprofit that has hosted exhibitions on the first and second floors of its 25,000-square-foot space for 48 years.</p>\n    <p>Artists have not been able to enter the building and determine the extent of devastation to their spaces.

His studio’s windows were intact, and she hoped that any water damage from hoses and sprinklers his space sustained would be minimal.</p>\n    <p>“I have a lot of works on paper, and they would be ruined,” Poneros told <i>Hyperallergic</i>. “It’s basically 15 years of my life packed into that 1,000 square feet of space.

It’s possible the whole building will be condemned due to safety issues.”</p>\n    <p>Meg Suttles, founder of the arts residency and gallery space <a href=\"https://hot-wood-arts.mailchimpsites.com/\">Hot Wood Arts</a>, told <i>Hyperallergic</i> that she was awakened by text messages from two of her studio neighbors who saw firefighters entering the building just before midnight. She took a cab and arrived at Van Brunt Street at 1am, and stayed up the entire night as her portion of the warehouse became engulfed in flames. </p>\n    <p>“I made a lot of 2am calls when I knew it was going to be devastating,” Suttles said. “We’re just in shock today.

    "body": "<p>Stepping out of a sleek office tower in Shanghai, I hear a bell ringing from Jing’an Temple. In the shadow of steel and glass stands a centuries-old Buddhist shrine. Its curled eaves and drifting incense offer a quiet counterpoint to the digital tickers flashing above trading floors. As a finance professor, I interpret corporate decisions like dividend payments through the lenses of incentives, governance and regulation. But, in that moment, I wondered: could the moral rhythms of the temple – with its teachings of harmony, reciprocity and impermanence – be quietly shaping the boardroom across the street? What if the chants of monks and the calculations of CEOs weren’t as far apart as we assume?</p>\n<p>That question led me to think more broadly: how do values persist across time, even as belief systems shift? China’s spiritual and philosophical traditions – especially Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism – have long shaped attitudes toward wealth, obligation and fairness. These influences may seem distant from today’s stock markets, yet their traces remain visible in how people understand legitimacy and virtue, even in the realm of commerce.</p>\n<p>In imperial China, merchants occupied a low place in the social hierarchy, ranked below farmers, artisans and scholars. Yet many built reputations not only through commerce but through acts of generosity, supporting temples, schools and public works. Profit and virtue were not seen as opposites, but as forces that could be balanced through wisdom and restraint. This ethos was significantly challenged during the early decades of the People’s Republic, when traditional religions were classified as ‘feudal superstition’ and many temples were closed during the Cultural Revolution. These policies reflected the priorities of that historical period, focused on class struggle and rapid industrialisation. Yet even amid sweeping transformation, many moral traditions persisted. From the 1980s onward, as China pursued reform and opening-up, spiritual traditions gradually re-emerged, complementing the country’s economic development and cultural revitalisation efforts under the evolving framework of socialism with Chinese characteristics. That ancient ideal still lingers beneath the surface of modern Chinese capitalism. Today, companies listed on stock exchanges operate in a global market, but their decisions are often shaped by those older moral logics. As I was to discover, even something as technical as a corporate dividend may still bear the imprint of beliefs rooted in Buddhism, Taoism and centuries of ethical tradition.</p>\n<p>Today, the worlds of tradition and commerce often coexist in unexpected proximity. I grew up observing how deeply cultural values shape people’s behaviour – often unconsciously. Still, it might seem unlikely that spiritual traditions could influence something as technical as corporate dividend policy.</p>\n<p>Dividend payments are the portion of profit that a company pays out to its shareholders – essentially, a reward to investors for their trust. In modern capitalism, dividends are not mandatory; they are a voluntary decision made by a firm’s leadership to return value to its owners. Unlike wages, which compensate labour, or charitable donations, which serve public good, dividends reflect a deliberate act of profit-sharing within capitalist enterprise. Choosing to pay them signals financial strength, accountability and a long-term commitment to shareholder value. Beyond just a payout, they represent a gesture of corporate accountability. In the realm of corporate governance, regular dividends are often <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=226317\">interpreted</a> as a sign of respect for shareholders and a mechanism to discipline management by reducing discretionary cash reserves.</p>\n<p>Dividends are typically explained using financial theories or legal frameworks. Conventional finance emphasises formal factors such as taxation, investor protection laws and corporate governance rules. Yet in China, a country often described as having the Buddha on the bookshelf and the <i>Tao</i> in the boardroom, I began to suspect that there was more to the story.</p>\n<p>Nearly half of all profitable firms still went three or more consecutive years without paying a cent</p>\n<p>Take the term ‘iron rooster’. In Chinese, <i>tie gong ji</i> is a metaphor for stinginess – a rooster so iron-clad you cannot pluck a single feather from it. For years, Chinese investors used this colourful insult to describe companies that never pay dividends. As one financial newspaper lamented, ‘some companies would rather be iron roosters sitting on piles of cash than share a feather with investors.’ The problem was widespread: low or non-existent dividends have long undermined investor confidence in China’s stock markets. Throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, many listed firms would report profits yet refuse to share the bounty – a far cry from what shareholders might expect in more mature markets. Regulators grew so frustrated that they launched campaigns to crack down on these dividend-shy companies. In 2017, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission even threatened ‘hard measures’ against the perennial non-payers, invoking the iron rooster idiom in a fiery speech. And in 2023, authorities rolled out rules tying executive performance evaluations to dividend payouts and barring large shareholders from selling stock if their companies hadn’t paid dividends in years. The intent was clear: coax the roosters to finally shed some feathers.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-chinese-religious-traditions-shape-corporate-generosity?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Sean Aaron Smith may have started out in the former camp, but in the early days of the COVID pandemic, he ended up in the latter—and in an effort to be part of the solution, he began setting fire to cell phone towers around San Antonio. A hell of a read (as always) from Brendan I. Koerner.</p><blockquote><p>During one of his attacks, Smith snagged a souvenir that caught his eye: a warning sign that read, “Radio frequency fields near some antennas may exceed the FCC occupational rules for human exposure.” The Federal Communications Commission mandates the posting of these signs for the benefit of maintenance workers who must occasionally climb to the peaks of towers. But Smith mistakenly thought this language amounted to a government confession that civilians within a wide radius of a tower are in constant danger. He delighted in showing off the sign when evangelizing to fellow miscreants about 5G’s role in transforming the US into a repressive dystopia. He could only hope his audiences were listening more intently to his lectures than he’d listened to his prison friend back in 2014.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about conspiracy theories</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/04/22/radioactive-man/\">Radioactive Man</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“On (maybe) unraveling a government cover-up.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2024/03/19/jacobs-dream/\">Jacob’s Dream</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“MAGA meets the Age of Aquarius.”</p><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2023/06/14/a-star-reporters-break-with-reality/\">A Star Reporter’s Break With Reality</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Lara Logan was once a respected 60 Minutes correspondent.

She quickly found herself controlled by her visa broker, a violent man who held her passport and threatened her family. Max Blau and Zaydee Sanchez trace Sofi’s harrowing path through the thick of Operation Blooming Onion, a three-year, multi-agency investigation that revealed sprawling abuse of the H-2A visa. Though central to a major investigation, the details of Sofi’s story have largely been confined to court documents. Here, they are made vivid, unfolded with tension and intimacy.</p><blockquote><p>Sofi was among the first groups of people recruited to work for Kings Berry Farm. She initially felt some relief when she stepped off the bus in the parking lot of the dingy motel, after making it past customs and having spent more than 20 hours on the road. But she was taken aback by how she and the others were treated by the people there to meet them: The workers were unloaded like prisoners, their heads bowed so they couldn’t see what was happening.</p><p>One of the people who received the workers separated Sofi from the rest. She recalled that she was taken to a motel room. She found another female worker waiting there. Guards were assigned to watch them.</p><p>It was in the motel room that she first saw Mendoza. Short and stout with a shaggy chinstrap beard, he spoke with a strong lisp because of a congenital disorder. It could be hard to understand what he was saying, but that day he had no problem making his message clear.</p><p>Sofi recalled that the other woman asked Mendoza if she could have her passport back. Mendoza said that if she had it in her mind to leave his operation, she’d have to do so without her passport. She wasn’t getting it back.</p><p>He already had Sofi’s.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks from ProPublica</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/01/09/i-have-lost-everything/\">“I Have Lost Everything.”</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>A record number of Americans are living outside.

It plans to lay off at least half of the department's workforce, more than 1,000 people, and the Supreme Court has agreed that it can. And in response to troubling data from the latest Nation's Report Card, which is out this month, the president reiterated his plans to, quote, \"return education back to the individual states,\" unquote.</p>\n<p>Longtime teachers' union leader Randi Weingarten says whatever the problems with the nation's schools, this administration is not trying to solve them. Instead, she says, these efforts are really part of a plan to destroy public education, which itself is part of a plan to weaken democracy. Weingarten makes this argument in a fiery new book called \"Why Fascists Fear Teachers.\" And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Good morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p>\n<p>RANDI WEINGARTEN: Good morning.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: So let me start with, why this book now? You've been president of the American Federation of Teachers, AFT, since 2008. What motivated this book now? This is your first book, so clearly you felt strongly enough about something to take the time away from your day job to write this.</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: So I started thinking about this particular book in the weeks and months after we got back to school from COVID and thought about why all of these smears and why this level? There started to be a different kind of political attack on teachers. And it was coming from extreme forces, some on the left, but mostly on the right, that seemed different. The smears seemed different.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You don't pull any punches with the title, which accurately represents the tone of the book. But despite that, you say that you're not interested in the labels as much as the actions. What is it about public schools per se that you think is particularly challenging to people who you believe try to weaken democracy?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think we teach kids how to really think, not what to think, but how to think. We teach kids how to live with each other in a diverse environment. That's why welcoming...</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Because they have no choice, basically. Public schools have to welcome all comers, I guess, right?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: Exactly. But in that realm, that is critically important, particularly if you think about what's going on in America and the attack on immigrants and the attack on diversity. We actually believe in opportunity for all, not opportunity for some. And that is different than a competitive model. If you think about education as the public square or education as imperative to democracy, which is what the founders thought. Then you think about, what are the three things, Michel, that give regular people power? It's voting, it's education and it's some economic power. And so what teachers and their unions do is basically two of the three.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: Teachers are one of the last remaining heavily unionized workforces in the country. You're arguing that their efforts to unionize pose a challenge to autocrats. But you also make the case that the interests of kids and families and the interests of teachers are aligned. But what if they aren't? Isn't the role of the union to protect the interests of teachers, even if that conflicts with the interests of kids and parents as they perceive them?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think our role is to do everything in our power to align those interests. And in 2010, parents and teacher unions really were divergent. I saw that as a clarion call. So 2024, several years after COVID, we asked that question again. In that polling, it was 74% approved of teachers and 9% disapproved. But even the union in 2024, what we saw is 53% of people approved of teacher unions and 22% disapproved of them. We have to align them.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: You begin the book by talking about how some conservative activists have used critical race theory, which is a complex legal analysis of racism, to attack public education, implying that it's being taught, you know, in third grade, at levels which is not appropriate. Why do you think that people are receptive to these arguments?</p>\n<p>WEINGARTEN: I think there's a lot of fear. There's a lot of anxiety. I think social media has been a pretty prime reason. I think that the politics have gotten corrosive. And when you have this kind of fear and anxiety in a country, it creates distrust. Frankly, Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Tim Snyder, all of these historians talk about what autocrats or what oligarchs or others end up doing to exploit it.</p>\n<p>MARTIN: What do you have to say about the Nation's Report Card data that the president cited in saying that this is exactly why the Department of Education needs to be rethought? What do you have to say about those test scores?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5484236/why-fascists-fear-teachers-explores-how-attacks-on-education-undermine-democracy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The APEX Museum’s message said the rope “was deemed not to be a ‘noose’ by Homeland Security and has since been removed from the premises for evidence.”</p>\n    <p>In his message, Moore wrote, “For Black communities in the United States, a noose is a symbol of terror representing lynchings, hatred, racial violence, and a system that once publicly sanctioned the murder of Blacks to enforce white supremacy. Placed beside a museum dedicated to Black life and resilience, the rope reads as an act of intimidation: a clear message intended to wound … silence … and to remind people that the same threats and violence of our country’s past can be conjured in the present.”</p>\n    <p>He added: “Museums are anchors of our communities, our country, and our world memories. They represent our trials, triumphs, griefs, hopes, journeys, evolutions, our hearts and our spirits. Such symbols of hatred in or near these institutions are a travesty that dishonor the work of scholars, activists, descendants, and survivors who have labored to turn historic stories full of pain and achievement into education and hope for the future.”</p>\n    <p>Current exhibits listed at the APEX Museum include “Sweet Auburn: Street of Pride” (about the Sweet Auburn Historic District in which the institution resides) as well “Africa: The Untold Story,” “The MAAFA: The African Holocaust,” “Women in STEM,” and “The Big Ideal!

Wearing headphones and VR headsets, these nondescript characters appear perpetually distracted and immersed in their technologies of choice. On the gallery walls is a collection of circular works from the artist’s <i>Sky Target</i> series, which varies mirrors and cloudy expanses in stripes or concentric rings.

Because let's be clear: foundries around the world are pushing the boundaries of the discipline every day of the week. And that doesn't just mean crafting brand-new typefaces, but also breathing new life into timeless classics.</p>\n<p>There's just one problem: with all the incredible font releases out there, it's easy for some to slip under the radar. Which is exactly why we reached out to the Creative Boom community to find out which fonts they're buzzing about for 2026. Wisdom of crowds and all that.</p>\n<p>You'll find the results below: 50 popular typefaces that graphic designers look likely to make strong use of in the year to come. It's a heady fusion of retro vibes and modern functionality, from elegant serifs being reimagined for the digital age to bold, expressive sans-serifs ready to make a serious splash in branding and editorial design. Interestingly, our survey revealed a ton of old favourites. This is something we're seeing a lot of across the creative community – a return to familiar territory. Perhaps it's a comfort thing during challenging times. Who knows?</p>\n<p>In short, whether you're looking to refresh your go-to collection or searching for new type to bring your latest project to life, you're sure to find some exciting options. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>GT America aims to bridge 19th-century American Gothics with 20th century European Neo-Grotesk traditions, and take the finest design features from both. In practice, it proves remarkably versatile, and works well across both corporate identity systems and editorial applications. Designed by Noël Leu with Seb McLauchlan, this comprehensive family offers 84 styles, with extensive script extensions developed alongside Tania Chacana.</p>\n<p>Sight Lines: Women in Art in Aotearoa by Studio Katie Kerr <a href=\"https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america\">GT America</a> by Grilli Type</p>\n<p>Kris Sowersby's Söhne captures the memory of Akzidenz-Grotesk, filtered through Helvetica's influence, and specifically evokes the analogue feel of Standard Medium as used in New York's subway signage. But rather than being a direct revival, Sowersby has created something more nuanced: a typeface that channels the confident boldness of those classic grotesques, while feeling utterly contemporary at the same time. Built from the semibold weight outward, it includes condensed, wide and monospaced variants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://klim.co.nz/collections/soehne/\">Söhne</a> by Klim Type Foundry</p>\n<p>An \"emphatically vanilla\" editorial workhorse, Graphik has become one of Commercial Type's most popular releases. This hybrid typeface combines geometric sans-serif roundness with European grotesk architecture and proportions, while avoiding the baggage of more dogmatic modernist alternatives. Its low contrast, open counters and compact descenders make it a good choice for tight editorial settings, whilst human touches such as round dots mean it also works well for display.</p>\n<p>Mark Bloom and Joe Leadbeater's Aeonik presents itself as a neo-grotesque with geometric foundations, achieving mechanical precision through strict perpendicular terminals, whilst maintaining warmth through its rounded letterforms. Its eight weights, from Air to Black, are enhanced by variable font technology and since launching in 2021, it's become a favourite for global brands including Revolut, Eurosport, Alipay and Virgin Hyperloop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik\">Aeonik</a> by CoType Foundry</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik\">Aeonik</a> by CoType Foundry</p>\n<p>Mat Desjardins created Neue Montreal in 2018 as a versatile grotesque with the spirit of a display font. Inspired by the Canadian city that became a beacon of modernist design in the 1960s and 1970s—a place where graphic design wasn’t just a profession, but a cultural force—this timeless sans-serif has been the official typeface of football club Montreal FC since 2021. It's available in 14 weights.</p>\n<p>Joan Creative – <a href=\"https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal\">Neue Montreal</a> by Pangram Pangram</p>\n<p>Originally developed for photography magazine Hotshoe in 2012, Basis Grotesque drew inspiration from Akzidenz and early Monotype grotesques. But it's since been refined towards something more considered and shapely. The family's skeletal consistency across weights creates a sense of unity, whilst allowing each style to develop its own personality, from Light through to Black.</p>\n<p>Maison Neue is a complete reconstruction of the original Maison family, moving beyond the latter's rigid geometric construction towards greater optical refinement. This superfamily of 40 styles includes the original, subtly condensed version, an extended counterpart, and mono-spaced alignment, each with additional weights.</p>\n<p>ABC Favorit is a straightforward yet characterful grotesque that combines geometric rigidity with subtle oddities and humorous touches. Designed by Johannes Breyer and Fabian Harb, it's available in five weights with italics, along with extended and expanded variants. Smart underlines create unconventional letter shapes, whilst script extensions cover Greek, Cyrillic, Hangul and Arabic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit\">Favorit</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit\">Favorit</a> by Dinamo Typefaces GmbH</p>\n<p>Appearing in three versions since its birth in 2016, Lucas Sharp's Sharp Grotesk Global has evolved from hand-drawn poster lettering into Sharp Type's most comprehensive superfamily.

    "body": "<p>British artist <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/galleries/gillianjason/artist-emily-ponsonby/\">Emily Ponsonby</a> grew up the daughter of a beekeeper, leading to a lifelong interest in both the insects themselves and the materiality of their waxen, honeycomb homes. Following extensive experimentation with the beeswax, Ponsonby ultimately made the material a hallmark of her work, resulting in uniquely textural, tactile paintings that explore themes and subjects connected to everyday life, human connection, and the intersection of emotional and physical spaces.</p>\n<p>On view through October 19, Ponsonby’s newest body of work is on view at London’s <a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/galleries/gillianjason/\">Gillian Jason Gallery</a> in “<a href=\"https://www.artnet.com/galleries/gillianjason/a-warm-life-through-butter\">A Warm Life Through Butter</a>.” Opening on the heels of her shortlist selection for the National Portrait Gallery’s Herbert Smith Freehills Portrait Award, in this collection the artist returns her compositions once again to the intimate moments and private spaces she is best known for—made using beeswax, naturally.</p>\n<p>Timed to the show, we reached out to Ponsonby to learn more about how she arrived at her medium and process, and what she hopes viewers take away with them.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2688984\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Ponsonby.

Courtesy of Gillian Jason Gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>With the recent debut of your solo show at Gillian Jason Gallery, can you tell us a bit about the body of work on view and some of the exhibition’s underpinning themes?</strong></p>\n<p>My new solo is comprised of fifteen layered encaustic works. They have taken a year to bubble to the surface. The show moves with the grain of human connection—intimate, tender, and resonant. The paintings are breathing surfaces, built for the small rituals of gathering, for the half-said story at a table, for the comfort of hands resting near one another. What emerges is an exploration of the settings both literal and emotional—that host our shared experiences, our individual stories and the warm glow of creative collective minds.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2689001\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Ponsonby, <em>Chess Players</em> (2025). Courtesy of Gillian Jason Gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>How did you arrive at the use of beeswax and oil in your work? What about these materials fits best with your creative vision?</strong></p>\n<p>I was at Leith School of Art in Edinburgh when I first learnt about the wonderful world of encaustic painting. I then swiftly went on a deep dive at the British Museum researching the first known examples, the Ancient Egyptians’ Fayum portraits. It makes sense that I work with a material as malleable as wax as I’m super tactile and wide eyed about textures. Carving into the wax with my nails, a blade or the tail of a brush helps the paintings to pulse with a dynamic tension, a constant push and pull between bold gestures and subtle strokes, tightening and loosening and playing simultaneously with both perfection and imperfection.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2689002\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Ponsonby, <em>Salted and Preserved</em> (2025). Courtesy of Gillian Jason Gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you give us some insight into your process both technically and inspirationally? Where do you start?</strong></p>\n<p>Every painting begins by picking up a pencil and sketching the stories unspooling in front of me. Then often I do a monotype of the drawing to play with the colors and loosen up the composition, something switches in my head to relinquish all control when printing a plate because you are playing with so many wonderfully unstable variables. Finally, the painting begins.</p>\n<p>I have been working with encaustic for the last 14 years. This involves melting and brushing beeswax and pigment into wooden panels before sculpting back into the layers and then drawing the image to the surface. Many works have ended up in the wood burner during the developmental stages—a good thing as the push and pull and play stage is essential. For a while, I used “golden syrup” colored beeswax where the bees had collected pollen from spindly stalked wildflowers. This was problematic when creating subtle skin tones, so I changed to a lighter creamier colored beeswax, the product of bees feeding on stockier heather and lavender which gives the paintings a lovely warm glow. The majority of whites in the painting’s surface are peering through the pigments from the beeswax layer below.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2688990\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Ponsonby, Buttered Greens (2025). Courtesy of Gillian Jason Gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>For visitors of the show and viewers of your work at large, what do you hope the viewing experience is like? What do you hope people take away with them?</strong></p>\n<p>I hope they feel like they could pull out a chair and take a seat at the table alongside wise, curious minds and big embraces. My paintings are not just what the eye sees; they’re what the heart feels—the invisible warmth between people as they share bread, time, and stories. I want the viewer to feel part of this story too.</p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-2688992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Emily Ponsonby, Strawberry Moon (2025).

She was the daughter of the future Count Baldwin V of Flanders (then one of the most important principalities in Europe) and Adela, the daughter of King Robert II ‘the Pious’ of France.</p>\n<p>Matilda had two brothers, Baldwin and Robert. Described by a contemporary chronicler as ‘highly born’, she could trace her descent from the kings of France, the emperors of Germany and even the Anglo-Saxon dynasty. The latter connection would be of great value to her future husband, William of Normandy.</p>\n<p>There is no surviving likeness of Matilda, but a later chronicler described her as “one of the most beautiful women that could be seen”. Her skeleton was examined in 1961 and recorded as being four feet two inches tall. This was likely a miscalculation, but she was known to be of small stature, as was her eldest son Robert ‘Curthose’ (meaning ‘short trousers’).</p>\n<p>Matilda was better educated than most noble women at the time. She was clever, politically astute, strong-willed and fiercely ambitious – qualities that would spark criticism and unease among her contemporaries, and that would shape the negative portrayals of her in the chronicles of the time.</p>\n<p>Among Matilda’s first suitors was a Saxon lord named Brihtric Mau (or Meaw), who had been sent to Flanders as an ambassador by King Edward the Confessor.</p>\n<p>Brihtric was one of the richest and most powerful nobles in England, and his vast lands spanned six western counties from Cornwall to Worcestershire. As well as being a man of wealth and influence, Brihtric was a tall and “stalwart”, with light blonde hair; one chronicler claims that Matilda fell in love with him at first sight. Without pausing to seek her father’s approval, she sent a messenger to England to offer herself in marriage.</p>\n<p>In an age when daughters were expected to meekly accept the fate that was decided for them by their parents, this was an astonishingly audacious act and gives an early glimpse of her forthright nature. But to her dismay and outrage, Brihtric rejected her proposal.</p>\n<p>Matilda never forgot the slight. Years later, when Queen of England, she had his lands confiscated and threw him into prison, where he died in mysterious circumstances. It was widely rumoured that Matilda had ordered his murder.</p>\n<h2>Matilda of Flanders and William of Normandy</h2>\n<p>In the late 1040s, Matilda received a proposal of marriage from William, Duke of Normandy. He had been the duke since the age of about seven or eight, and was widely known as ‘William the Bastard’, thanks to his illegitimacy. Although he grew into a fierce warrior who saw off Normandy’s enemies and extended its territories, he never shook off the stain of bastardy. He therefore set his sights on a wife with more than enough royal blood for the both of them.</p>\n<p>Matilda’s father greeted Duke William’s proposal with enthusiasm – given his duchy bordered Flanders, it would be a strategically advantageous alliance. But when his daughter heard of it, she declared that she would not lower herself to marry a ‘base-born duke’.</p>\n<p>Furious, William rode over to Flanders and confronted his would-be bride, dragging her to the ground, rolling her in the mud and almost beating her to death “with his fists, heels, and spurs”.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Read more |</strong><a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/norman/king-and-conqueror-true-story-real-history/\">How historically accurate is</a><i>King and Conqueror</i>?</li></ul>\n<p>According to contemporary chronicles, just a few days later Matilda announced that she would marry none but William, since “he must be a man of great courage and high daring” to have ventured to “come and beat me in my own father’s palace”.</p>\n<p>Whatever the truth of this outlandish tale, the couple were betrothed shortly afterwards.</p>\n<p>But there was another obstacle: Pope Leo IX prohibited the marriage on the grounds that William and Matilda were distantly related. Yet William and Matilda were not to be dissuaded; they defied the ban and married in secret in around 1050.</p>\n<h2>Matilda as Duchess of Normandy</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/norman/real-matilda-of-flanders-william-the-conqueror-wife-life-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024, Matt Elton spoke to historian Adam IP Smith about the history of violent attacks on US leaders. In this interview, first published in the October 2024 issue of <i>BBC History Magazine</i>, Smith discussed the political and social repercussions of such assaults across the decades</p>\n<h3>Matt Elton: Assassinations, and attempted assassinations, have occurred around the world throughout history. But is there a particularly American aspect to this story of political violence?</h3>\n<p><strong>Adam IP Smith:</strong> I think there is. Political violence is hardly unique to the US, sadly, so we must be careful about ascribing American exceptionalism to what we saw at Donald Trump’s rally [in Pennsylvania on 13 July 2024]. There is nevertheless an American political tradition into which this specific kind of gun violence – the attempted assassination of leading political figures, especially presidents and presidential candidates – fits.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>On the podcast |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/assassinations-us-history-podcast-adap-ip-smith/\">Adam IP Smith on assassinations that shaped US history</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<h3>As a historian, do you think it’s a stretch to suggest that the violence that shaped the founding of the modern nation may have paved the way for later political violence in the US?</h3>\n<p>Certainly the political polarisation and the potential for political violence we’re seeing today form part of a recurrent pattern in US history.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons, but maybe the core one is that there’s long been a fundamental disagreement within the US about who constitutes the legitimate American nation. That has led to a fear, genuinely held by significant numbers of people involved in the political process, that the stakes are so high because if their political enemies win then everything will be lost – that their freedom, the republic, even their own place in society will be jeopardised.</p>\n<p>That’s partly because, from the beginning, the president of the United States has held many of the powers held by monarchs – in some respects, even greater powers. <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/georgian/george-washington-first-us-president-founding-father-facts-life/\">George Washington</a> had more influence over the government of the US than <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/membership/history-explorer-the-decline-of-george-iii/\">George III</a> had over the government in London, for instance. So the monarchical style of the US head of state puts a huge amount of pressure on that role, which needs to feel like the embodiment of America at that particular moment in time.</p>\n<h3>The first US president targeted was Andrew Jackson in 1835 – an episode that’s less familiar to many in the UK than later attempts. Why is that?</h3>\n<p>The reason may be just that it was unsuccessful: the gun wielded by the would-be assassin malfunctioned. If Jackson had been shot on the steps of the Capitol, then we would know about it.</p>\n<p>Jackson already had a bullet lodged in him from an earlier duel, one of several he’d fought (in one of which, some 30 years earlier, he’d killed a man). So Jackson himself was no stranger to gun violence. He was a deeply controversial and polarising figure – and, perhaps not irrelevantly to this conversation, the president to whom those advancing Trump’s agenda have most wanted to compare Trump.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Read more |</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/general-history/famous-assassinations/\">50 assassinations that changed the world</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>Jackson was kind of an outsider – the original ‘drain the Washington swamp’ candidate. He first ran to become president in 1824, but failed due to what he called a “corrupt bargain”, and argued that the election had been stolen from him. He ran again in 1828 and won convincingly, defeating John Quincy Adams, who was the last of the old guard.</p>\n<p>In fact, Jackson was a wealthy slave holder in Tennessee – he wasn’t some hard-scrabble guy anymore – but he had literally been born in a log cabin and had worked his way up. Like Trump – indeed, like Trump’s new running mate, JD Vance, and many other big figures in American political history – he was of Scots Protestant Irish descent.</p>\n<p>The tradition that Jackson, Trump and Vance have tried to embody is one of rugged individualism, of standing up for yourself. It’s a kind of frontier mythos – the idea that in the end you have nothing to rely on but your wits and your bravery and your courage, and it’s all about you and your family.</p>\n<p>Jackson was both a perpetrator and a victim of gun violence. So in a way, if he had have been shot, it wouldn’t have fundamentally changed the image of him.

Dubbed “Prisoner 77,” Pietrzykowski faced terrible odds at Auschwitz, where more than a million people would perish between 1940 and 1945. But Pietrzykowski managed to survive, largely by winning dozens of boxing matches.</p>\n<p>The bantamweight vice-champion of Poland and a champion of Warsaw, Pietrzykowski soon realized that boxing could win him extra food and privileges — provided that he won his bouts. During his time at Auschwitz, Pietrzykowski engaged in between 40 and 60 matches, purportedly only losing just one of them. And while he boxed for the entertainment of the guards, he also became a symbol of hope for his fellow prisoners.</p>\n<p>This is the incredible true story of Tadeusz Pietrzykowski, as seen in the 2020 Polish film <i>The Champion of Auschwitz</i>.</p>\n<h2>A Rising Star In Polish Boxing</h2>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski was born on April 8, 1917, in Warsaw, Poland. He was too young to remember <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww1-photos\">World War I</a>, which ended some months before his second birthday, and spent most his youth focused on sports. Pietrzykowski was interested in soccer as a teenager, and soon showed his skill as a boxer. </p>\n<p>He trained with a coach named Feliks “Papa” Stamm, who oversaw the development of scores of young boxers. Pietrzykowski took his training seriously, though <a href=\"https://polishnews.com/pietrzykowskis-fights-in-auschwitz\">Polish News</a> reports Pietrzykowski’s family thought his talents lay more in art than in boxing or soccer. </p>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski around 1938.</p>\n<p>“Teddy left behind notes about his workouts, which tell us how he was developing tactics and technique,” Dr. Karol Nawrocki, director at the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańs, Poland, told <i> Vice</i> in 2020. </p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski showed early promise, competing in matches that placed him among the best in his weight class. While he lacked the size of a heavyweight, his technical skill, sharp footwork, and grit made him a formidable fighter. By 1939, he was considered one of Poland’s young athletes to watch — until fate intervened.</p>\n<h2>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s Deportation To Auschwitz</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww2-color-photos\">World War II</a> began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Pietrzykowski promptly put down his boxing gloves down and joined the fight. He joined a light artillery regiment and defended Warsaw against the Nazis and, when the city fell, headed to France, where thousands of his countrymen were forming a new Polish army under General Władysław Sikorski.</p>\n<p>Public DomainGerman tanks in the streets of Warsaw in September 1939.</p>\n<p>But Pietrzykowski never made it.</p>\n<p>Instead, the Gestapo arrested the 23-year-old on the Hungaro-Yugoslav border. Not long after that, Pietrzykowski became one of the first transports to the newly established <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/liberation-of-auschwitz\">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>, where he was branded with the number 77. A Catholic political prisoner, Pietrzykowski was thrust into a new, brutal world that would seek to dehumanize him as much as possible. </p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski didn’t start boxing in Auschwitz right away. At first, he was assigned to work in a carpenter’s shop, and though the labor was backbreaking, his prior fitness helped him persevere.</p>\n<p>All that changed in March 1941.</p>\n<h2>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s First Fight In Auschwitz</h2>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski found that winning boxing matches could earn him extra food, which he shared with his fellow prisoners.</p>\n<p>Tadeusz Pietrzykowski’s first fight came about by chance. In 1941, on a Sunday, Pietrzykowski noticed a large crowd near the camp kitchens. Suddenly, one person from the crowd broke away and called to him.</p>\n<p>“One of them ran towards me and shouted, ‘Teddy, you want a piece of bread, come quickly. There is a German boxer among us. I’m looking for someone to box with him and beat him. The winner will be rewarded with bread,'” Pietrzykowski<a href=\"https://www.normandy1944.info/holocaust/tadeusz-pietrzykowski\"> recalled of the fight years later</a>. “I weighed 42 kg [92 pounds], but decided to fight right away. I saw a perfectly built blonde, holding gloves that we used in winter during our work. When I was seen, the crowd laughed because I was very skinny.”</p>\n<p>Pietrzykowski’s opponent was Walter Düning, a German kapo (a prisoner who oversaw other prisoners), who had been a successful boxer before the war. He was a formidable opponent. But despite the odds, Pietrzykowski outmaneuvered Düning and claimed victory.</p>\n<p>That was the moment Pietrzykowski realized that boxing could secure him special privileges at Auschwitz.</p>\n<p>“At one point, Walter Düning lowered his gloves,” Pietrzykowski recalled. “He stopped fighting and, appreciating my advantage over him, asked which commando I would like to work in. I replied ‘Tierpfleger’ [animal caretaker] knowing that there could be additional food such as bagasse, swede, and carrots.”</p>\n<p>Family Photo Archive of Eleonora SzafranPietrzykowski fought more than 40 matches during his time in the concentration camp.</p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, Pietrzykowski became known as a boxer. The Auschwitz guards found him amusing and began “enrolling” him in other fights, sometimes against guards, sometimes against other inmates. The guards often placed bets on the outcomes of the fights, but to call the events sport would be a disservice to the word.</p>\n<p>These were exercises in cruelty.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://allthatsinteresting.com/tadeusz-pietrzykowski\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>What makes a mountain truly impressive? Most people will point to Mount Everest, the tallest peak above sea level. But there are other mountains out there that may not win a prize for height, yet still evoke a sense of awe. How, then, do we quantify greatness? For <i>National Geographic</i>, Gordy Megroz explores this question and profiles Kai Xu, a 23-year-old mathematician who devised a method to calculate grandeur. Xu’s formula factors in a mountain’s height above its surroundings and the steepness of its rise, which produces a single number he calls “jut”: a measure of how dramatically a peak thrusts into the sky. You don’t need to be a mathematician or a mountain climber to appreciate this story—it’s unexpected and provocative, encouraging us to see the natural world in a new way. </p><p>(<strong>Note:</strong> You must enter an email address at <i>National Geographic</i> to read this article.)</p><blockquote><p>The math is intricate, but the concept is straightforward: Imagine standing right beneath a perfectly vertical 1,000-foot cliff, craning your neck straight up at the summit. From that spot, the viewpoint-impressiveness value would be a straightforward 1,000 feet. But looking at that same summit from farther away, at a 45-degree angle, it would seem less impressive, and the number would shrink accordingly. Meanwhile, a view of the summit from someplace</p><i>on</i>the mountain might have a steeper angle but so little height as to make the number lower still. The trick is in finding the sweet spot.</blockquote><blockquote><p>And of course, Xu crowned a new most magnificent mountain. When he crunched the numbers, it turned out none of the planet’s five highest peaks above sea level cracked the top five for jut. The world’s actual most impressive summit? Annapurna Fang, a 25,089-foot Himalayan peak with 11,1194 feet of jut—towering over Everest, figuratively speaking, with its measly 7,293 feet.</p></blockquote><h2>More picks about mountains</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/08/06/can-this-sherpa-change-mountain-climbing-forever/\">Can this Sherpa Change Mountain Climbing Forever?</a></h3>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Last year, at age 18, Nima Rinji Sherpa became the youngest climber to summit the world’s 14 tallest peaks.

    "body": "<p>Assassins and would-be assassins have become a sickeningly common feature of our polarized political landscape, and so have our rituals in the aftermath of the assailants’ heinous acts. First come the shock and the bipartisan expressions of regret. Then, almost as instantly, come the debates: Whose side was he on? Just as often as not, the clues come from fragments of the shooter’s life on the internet. Deciphering social-media messages, private chat-room records, and Google-search histories, we hunt for ideological bread crumbs.</p>\n<p>Tyler Robinson, the alleged assassin of the right-wing activist and <i>MAGA</i> ally <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/22/charlie-kirk-murder-and-the-crisis-of-political-violence\">Charlie Kirk</a>, used bullets that he had engraved with phrases that revealed less about his political affiliations than his fluency in deep internet culture. One bullet said “Hey fascist! Catch!,” then included a code for dropping a bomb in the video game Helldivers 2. Another said “If you Read / This, You Are / GAY / lmao,” and a third contained an emoticon-laced message drawn from furry subculture. (The symbol is not perverse because of its origins; it’s perverse because of how gleefully and literally it was weaponized, not unlike when Nikki Haley wrote “Finish them” on Israeli artillery destined for Gaza.) Spencer Cox, the Republican Governor of Utah, has said that Robinson subscribed to a “Leftist ideology.” According to court documents released on Tuesday, Robinson’s mother told investigators that he had moved to the left politically in the past year, becoming more “pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.” He had also begun to date his roommate, who, in his mother’s description, was male at birth and was transitioning. Text-message exchanges quoted in the documents show Robinson telling his roommate that he had killed Kirk because he’d “had enough of his hatred.” Still, it is unclear how Robinson made the leap from disliking Kirk’s views to deciding to murder him—he wrote, chillingly, that he’d been planning the shooting for only “a bit over a week”—and the messages that Robinson left behind remain a muddle. The phrase “Bella Ciao,” engraved on one bullet, is both the title of a famous antifascist anthem and a phrase that crops up in video games. Some have pointed out that the song also appeared on a Spotify playlist associated with Groypers, a group of far-right, white-nationalist, meme-steeped internet denizens led by <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-young-political-spaces-of-the-internet\">Nick Fuentes</a>, who frequently attacked Kirk for not being extreme enough. In isolation, the references are vague enough to be interpreted every which way.</p>\n<p>According to an interview that Robinson’s grandmother gave to the <i>Daily Mail</i>, he grew up in a conservative family that staunchly supported Trump. He attended just one semester of college before dropping out. He was registered to vote in Utah but was unaffiliated with a party and did not vote in the 2024 Presidential election. Instead, he seems to have spent time in the corners of the internet where young men can become radicalized toward violence. Like <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-online-spaces-that-enable-mass-shooters\">Payton Gendron</a>, who committed a mass shooting at a Tops grocery store in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, Robinson left a trail of self-implicating messages on the chat-room app Discord. In one chat, he reportedly played dumb about Kirk’s murder, joking about how the suspect was his “doppelganger.” In another chat, though, he confessed to shooting Kirk, saying, “It was me,” just before going with his family to turn himself in to the police.</p>\n<p>Whatever radicalization Robinson may have undergone online, people in his offline life seem to have failed to fully understand what was happening to him. Only he knew what ideas he was steeping himself in, and the stubborn opacity of his motivations adds to our collective despair in this moment: if, as one TikTok commentator put it, Kirk’s assassination was in some sense a “shitpost”—a nihilistic in-joke translated horribly into real-world action—then an already senseless act becomes an utterly meaningless one. Memes are incoherent by nature; it’s useless to try to make them mean more than they do. That police are now talking about furries in public is Robinson’s gruesome joke, carried out for the benefit of the online audience that he was, on some level, performing for. (In the text exchange quoted in the court documents, he writes, “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”) Robinson is not alone in this self-referentiality and crackpot mythologizing; the alleged perpetrator of a shooting at a Colorado high school posted TikToks in which he’d copied the poses of previous shooters and showed off a T-shirt that referenced the Columbine mass shooting, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Shootings have effectively become their own memes, with their own viral tropes and signifiers. No matter what political ideas Robinson may have harbored, he might ultimately be best understood as a participant in that warped online culture.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/charlie-kirk-and-tyler-robinson-came-from-the-same-warped-online-worlds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>“I was losing my mind,” the chef and writer Samin Nosrat said. We were sitting in the living room of her small house in Oakland, and she was describing a period in her life, just after the arrival of <i>COVID</i> vaccines, when she was sunk in a depression and floundering in her attempts to write the follow-up to her 2017 cooking guide, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat-Mastering/dp/1476753830/\">Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</a>.” That book was a phenomenon whose promise to teach readers the four “elements of good cooking”—thus liberating them from the tyranny of recipes—proved irresistible. It earned Nosrat a James Beard Award, spawned a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/recommends/watch/samin-nosrats-sensual-compassionate-food-travels-in-salt-fat-acid-heat\">Netflix series</a>, and sold 1.4 million copies. In 2019, Nosrat sold a proposal for an ambitious sequel called “What to Cook,” which would help readers decide on a dish based on four constraints: time, resources, preferences, and ingredients. But the concept refused to cohere. After two years, she said, “I was, like, ‘Take the money back.’ ”</p>\n<p>One of her agents suggested that she just write, you know, a cookbook, with recipes. At first, Nosrat resisted. Though “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” includes recipes, it also sniffs at them. For beginning cooks, Nosrat writes, “recipes can be necessary and comforting, like training wheels.” She stresses that their ultimate goal should be to remove those training wheels: to “improvise, and judge what good food looks like on your own terms.”</p>\n<p>Nosrat distrusts recipes, but she’s very good at devising them. She might be responsible for more canonical dishes than any other writer in the past decade. The list of her hits reads like the <i>Billboard</i> Top Ten: her buttermilk roast chicken, her garlicky green beans, her <i>tahdig</i>, her focaccia. Just the other day, a friend was trying to figure out how to cook some chicken thighs, and I advised her to try Nosrat’s conveyor-belt chicken. As has been the case every one of the dozens of times I’ve cooked it, it worked perfectly.</p>\n<p>Nosrat tried to follow her agent’s advice, but she felt like a fraud. “There was nothing that made me excited to cook,” she recalled. “I was just trying to figure out, like, <i>What is the point? Who cares</i>?”</p>\n<p>One morning, Nosrat was in the middle of a misbegotten experiment—attempting to prepare meat al pastor in her kitchen, inspired by a documentary about tacos—when a friend texted and asked if she and her kids could stop over. “Sure,” Nosrat told her. “I’m just over here ruining some pork.”</p>\n<p>At this time, Nosrat said, she was searching for a way to handle the fame that “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat” had brought, and the concomitant feelings of guilt and self-doubt. Perhaps more important, she had tapered off the antidepressants she’d taken for years, in order to try psychedelic therapy—which didn’t work. The six pounds of pork she had ruined seemed like a synecdoche for her whole life, which, apparently, she had also ruined. When her friend arrived and saw her predicament, she suggested that Nosrat bring the pork to <i>her</i> house a few nights later; they’d figure out what to do with it together. Nosrat grasped at the invitation like a lifeline. That get-together evolved, over time, into Monday dinner, a now weekly ritual with a group of ten or so that, Nosrat told me, has become “the heart of everything for me.”</p>\n<p>It’s also at the heart of the book Nosrat has finally produced: “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Good-Things-Recipes-Rituals-Cookbook/dp/1984857789/\">Good Things</a>,” part cookbook, part self-portrait, which does indeed contain recipes, along with advice, confessions, and stories about her dog. It begins with an acknowledgment that Nosrat worries she’s betrayed her readers and herself by assembling “a book of recipes after writing ‘Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat,’ which is a veritable manifesto designed to free cooks from relying on them.” But, as the introduction suggests, “Good Things” represents a dramatic rethinking of what Nosrat wants out of life in general. She’s still not quite sure where that leads. It might take her away from food entirely.</p>\n<p>Nosrat was born in San Diego, the child of Iranian immigrants who’d arrived in the U.S. just a few years prior. When she was eighteen months old, her three-year-old sister, Sammar, died of brain cancer; the tragedy, Nosrat told me, contributed to her spending her own life as “a crazy achievement machine,” in an attempt to please her mother and make up for the absence. She struggled to fit in socially—a consequence, she’s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/i-fail-almost-every-day-an-interview-with-samin-nosrat\">said</a>, of growing up “as a brown kid in a super-white world”—but excelled academically. She was studying at U.C. Berkeley when, bewitched by a meal at Alice Waters’s restaurant Chez Panisse, she got a job there bussing tables and eventually talked her way into a culinary internship. Or, as Nosrat jokes, “I went from my incredibly demanding, impossible-to-please mother’s house into <i>another</i> incredibly demanding, impossible-to-please mother’s house.” She learned in Waters’s kitchen, then left the nest, serving stints as a sous-chef elsewhere, taking catering gigs, and beginning to teach others. Her first thirty-odd years, she said, trained her to be a perfectionist. “There’s a lot I appreciate in that,” she said. “I also constantly use it as a cudgel to, like, hate myself and be mean to myself.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-samin-nosrat-learned-to-love-the-recipe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Like a cheery Sisyphus, Fred dismantles an industrial chimney one brick at a time</h1>\n    <p>In 1979, a death-defying English handyman named Fred Dibnah (1938-2004) became something of a national folk hero after the BAFTA-winning documentary <i>Fred Dibnah: Steeplejack</i> first aired on the BBC. This excerpt from the film follows Dibnah as he takes on a job he had deliberately attempted to overbid to avoid – dismantling a massive industrial chimney brick by brick, with only a single spotter on the ground for assistance. In the piece, Dibnah comes across as a joyful 20th-century Sisyphus, laughing through the work even as it’s demanding, repetitive and dangerous. With the camerawork capturing the extraordinary size disparity between the man and the task at hand, the clip is often as thrilling as it is charming, making for an awe-inspiring appreciation of the kind of manual labour that often goes uncelebrated.</p>\n    <p>Video by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/\">BBC Archive</a></p>\n    <p>Director: Don Haworth</p>\n    <p>\n      <a

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>According to Ezra Klein of<i> The New York Times</i>, Charlie Kirk, the ultra-conservative political activist and podcaster assassinated last week in Utah, was doing politics “the right way.” Here, Ta-Nehisi Coates skewers Klein and other pundits and politicians for their reaction to Kirk’s death—a reaction that has whitewashed his carefully crafted legacy: </p><blockquote><p>Kirk subscribed to some of the most disreputable and harmful beliefs that this country has ever known. But it is still chilling to think that those beliefs would be silenced by a gunshot. The tragedy is personal—Kirk was robbed of his life, and his children and family will forever live with the knowledge that a visual record of that robbery is just an internet search away. And the tragedy is national. Political violence ends conversation and invites war; its rejection is paramount to a functioning democracy and a free society. “Political violence is a virus,” Klein noted. This assertion is true. It is also at odds with Kirk’s own words. It’s not that Kirk merely, as Klein put it, “defended the Second Amendment”—it’s that Kirk endorsed hurting people to advance his preferred policy outcomes.</p><p>In 2022, when Kirk was frustrated, for instance, by the presence of Lia Thomas on the University of Pennsylvania women’s swim team, Kirk did not call for “spirited discourse.” Instead, while discussing a recent championship tournament, he said he would have liked to have seen a group of fathers</p><a href=\"\">descend from the stands</a>, forming “a line in front of [Lia] Thomas and saying, ‘Hey, tough guy, you want to get in the pool? ’Cause you’re gonna have to come through us.” Mere weeks before his death, Kirk reveled in Trump’s deployment of federal troops to DC. “Shock and awe. Force,”<a href=\"\">he wrote</a>. “We’re taking our country back from these cockroaches.” And in 2023, Kirk told his audience that then president<a href=\"\">Joe Biden</a>was a “corrupt tyrant” who should be “put in prison<a href=\"\">and/or given the death penalty</a>for his crimes against America.”<p>What are we to make of a man who called for the execution of the American president, and then was executed himself? What are we to make of an NFL that, on one hand, encourages us to “</p><a href=\"\">End Racism</a>,” and, on the other, urges us<a href=\"\">to commemorate</a>an unreconstructed white supremacist? And what of the writers, the thinkers, and the pundits who cannot separate the great crime of Kirk’s death from the malignancy of his public life? Can they truly be so ignorant to the words of a man they have so rushed to memorialize? I don’t know. But the most telling detail in Klein’s column was that, for all his praise, there was not a single word in the piece from Kirk himself.</blockquote><h2>More picks about white supremacy</h2><h3><a href=\"https://longreads.com/2025/07/15/ive-seen-how-the-neo-nazi-movement-is-escalating-you-should-worry/\">I’ve Seen How the Neo-Nazi Movement Is Escalating.

An earlier painting of Niagara Falls had prompted a London paper to declare that “art wasn’t limited to Europe” and that “it was not necessary for genius to study in any school but that of nature.” His cloudscapes surpassed even <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">those of his Norwegian contemporary Knud Baade</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/173956226\">\n        <graphic data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=680%2C316&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"316\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85814\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=320%2C149&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=600%2C279&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=240%2C111&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fredericedwinchurch_niagara.jpg?resize=768%2C356&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/>\n      </a>\n    </p>\n<p><i>Niagara</i>by Frederic Edwin Church, 1857.

Details of exquisite aliveness punctuate the vista — a blue-blooming shrub, a pendulous bird’s nest, a resplendent quetzal perched on a branch, lichen on the bark of a broken tree, two people kneeling before a white wooden cross — all of it awash in light that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/12/12/knud-baade-clouds/\">only consciousness can see</a>, impossible for a camera lens to capture. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>Rebelling against the stale convention of gilded frames, Church had invented a new kind of frame made of walnut wood, onto which he draped curtains to give the illusion of a window opening when the painting was being revealed. Silver reflectors focused gas lights onto the canvas to emulate the sunlit atmosphere of the landscape itself. The effect, <i>The New York Times</i> wrote, was “simply magical” — “a new sensation in art, giving a reality of atmospheric space to the picture, and a delicacy to the tones of the coloring, which must be seen to be at all appreciated or understood.” Before the days of easy travel, before color photography, most of the visitors had never seen and would never see with their own eyes nature so wild, mountains so majestic. Here was virtual reality — an immersion in light, color, and feeling that speaks not just to the eye but to the entire system of being we call soul. </p>\n<p>\n      <i>The Heart of the Andes</i>\n    </p>\n<p>For three weeks, people packed into Church’s studio, sometimes more than two thousand per day, gasping each time the curtain was drawn open, shuddering with the vertigo of the sublime. On the closing day, the line for admission curled around the block, around the clock.

    "body": "<p>In a dark library lit by a single lamp, four men, a young woman and three children crowd around a circular dais. They are staring at a clockwork contraption called an orrery, housed within giant bands of metal that suggest a celestial sphere. Below, tiny planets rotate around the Sun, orbited by pearl moons. Concentric plates allow the planets to move according to their relative speeds. The lecturer in his striking red gown is pointing to Jupiter’s moons, while a younger man in a purple coat and gold striped waistcoat assiduously takes notes. His notetaking implies the event isn’t run-of-the-mill, but something special and worth recording. A small lamp has taken the place of the central sun in the orrery and throws light upon everyone’s faces. We can only see it as a reflection below the elbow of the silhouetted youth in the foreground – a wick burning in a jar of oil. The lamplight adds an eager gleam to the eyes of the inquisitive young children and illuminates the contemplative gaze of the young man on the right. It highlights the edges of the young woman’s frilled bonnet and the cheekbones of the adolescent who leans over the edge of the orrery in front of us. It is his shoulder that we can look over without feeling as if we are intruding. The lamp illuminates all our faces as our minds are enlightened by the science we observe in action.</p>\n<p>Today, <i>A Philosopher Giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is Put in the Place of the Sun</i> (1766)<i> </i>by Joseph Wright of Derby (1734-97) is rightly considered a masterpiece. When it was first exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens, London, in 1766, reviewers singled it out for particular praise, saying it was ‘exceeding fine’. It attracted more attention than any other work on display, inspiring one reviewer to break out in rhyming couplets: ‘Without a rival let this “Wright” be known,/For this amazing province is his own.’ Wright’s <i>Orrery</i> was a huge statement from a young and ambitious artist. So why, then, was he overlooked when the Royal Academy of Arts was founded by George III just two years later? When Wright had been lauded as a ‘genius’ at that same year’s Society of Artists exhibition? Why was he not a founder member of the new august institution?</p>\n<p>The Royal Academy was founded in December 1768 by George III at the behest of a small number of artists and architects. Membership was limited to 40, meaning more than 160 members of the Society of Artists did not make the cut. The Society had formed only eight years earlier, in 1760, as a way for Britain’s leading artists to meet, converse, study and exhibit together in London. It’s hard to imagine but there were no regular public exhibitions of art before this time. Art was shown to discerning patrons in artists’ studios and viewed in private collections in aristocratic homes. The Society changed this and, for a shilling (around £5 today), anyone could scrutinise the finest paintings of the year. At its peak, it had more than 200 members, including the country’s leading landscape painter Richard Wilson, the ‘grand manner’ portraitist Joshua Reynolds and the architect William Chambers, who would later design the Great Room of the Royal Academy. It also included younger artists such as the American painter Benjamin West and the history painter Nathaniel Dance, as well as Wright himself and his friends John Hamilton Mortimer and Ozias Humphry. These young men were finding their feet by exhibiting in this new annual mixed exhibition. Wright was 30 when he was elected a member of the Society in May 1765, the year his first ‘candlelight’ painting, <i>Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight</i> (1765), was exhibited to favourable reviews. While he was known as a portraitist in his home town of Derby, where he lived and worked, it was his ambitious candlelight paintings that significantly raised his profile in the capital.</p>\n<p><i>Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight</i> (1765) by Joseph Wright. Courtesy <a href=\"https://derbymuseums.org/event/joseph-wright-life-on-paper/\">Derby Museums</a></p>\n<p>Wright’s friends in London were young and opinionated artists, who were members of the Howdalian Society, but his circle in Derby was older and more scientific. John Whitehurst, a horologist and geologist, lived at 22 Iron Gate, a few doors away from Wright at number 28, while Peter Perez Burdett, a cartographer and son of an instrument maker, lived in Full Street. Burdett was so familiar with Wright that he often borrowed money from him (and never seemed to pay him back). Many of Whitehurst’s friends – including the doctor Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles Darwin) and the potter Josiah Wedgwood – were associated with the Lunar Society, a group of industrialists and natural philosophers who met regularly in Birmingham.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/joseph-wright-of-derby-put-science-at-the-centre-of-his-art?utm_source=rss-feed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h3>By Maria Popova</h3>\n<p>On July 26, 2022, as I was living through a period of acute loneliness despite being a naturally solitary person, NASA <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-lro-finds-lunar-pits-harbor-comfortable-temperatures/\">reported</a> that computer modeling of data from its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) had revealed several cylindrical pits on the Moon with just the right shape to be shaded just the right amount to offer shelter from the extremes of the lunar surface. Because the Moon has no atmosphere to act as its thermostat, its temperature fluctuates dramatically as it faces and turns away from the Sun, rising to 260°F (about 127°C) in the daytime and plummeting to -280°F (about -173°C) at night. But these unique nooks, which are most likely collapsed lava tubes, are a cozy 63°F (17°C) inside — he feeling-tone of a crisp autumn day in Brooklyn, where I live. Images from the LRO suggested that these pits might unfold into caves that would make perfect sites for lunar exploration — campsites with a stable temperature, more protected from cosmic rays, solar radiation, and micrometeorites. </p>\n<p>There is something poetic in knowing that we evolved in caves and might one day inhabit caves on another celestial body, having invented the means to get there with the imagination that bloomed over millions of years in the lonely bone cave of the mind.</p>\n<p>There is also something poetic in knowing that as we fantasize about leaving for the Moon, the Moon is leaving us.</p>\n<p>The prolific English astronomer Edmund Halley first began suspecting this disquieting fact in the early 18th century after analyzing ancient eclipse records. Nobody believed him — the Moon looked so steady, so unlosable. It took a quarter millennium for his theory to be vindicated: When <i>Apollo</i> astronauts placed mirrors on the lunar surface and when laser beams were beamed a them from Earth, it was revealed that the Moon is indeed drifting away from us, at the precise rate of 3.8 centimeters per year — more than half the rate at which a child grows.</p>\n<p>The Moon is leaving us because of the gravitational conversation between it and the Earth: the ocean tides. The drag they cause slows down the planet’s spin rate. Because gravity binds the Moon and the Earth, as the Earth loses angular momentum, the Moon overcompensates in response; as it speeds up, it begins slipping out of our gravitational grip, slowly moving away from us.</p>\n<p>We know this thanks to Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity — the revelation that space is not flat, time is not absolute, and spacetime is a single fabric along the curvature of which everything, including light, moves.</p>\n<p>I thought of Einstein, who at sixteen, lonely and introverted, began wondering about the nature of the universe by imagining himself chasing a beam of light through outer space; I thought of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, also lonely and also dedicated to the light, who at the same time was formulating his general theory of love as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/29/rilke-letters-to-a-young-poet-macy-barrows/\">“two solitudes that protect, border, and greet each other.”</a> And I thought about how love is simply the solitary light between people, neither partitioned nor merged but shared, to light up the sliver of spacetime we have each been allotted before returning our borrowed stardust to the universe.</p>\n<p>Somehow it all felt like a children’s book that didn’t yet exist. So I wrote it, having always believed that every good children’s book is a work of philosophy in disguise, a field guide to the mystery we are a part of and the mystery we are — in the language of children, which is the language of curiosity and unselfconscious sincerity, such books speak the most timeless truths to the truest parts of us by asking the simplest, deepest questions to help us understanding the world and understanding ourselves so that we may be more fully alive.</p>\n<p>By one of those wrinkles in time and chance that we call luck, shortly after I sent the manuscript to my friend Claudia at <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/enchanted-lion/\">Enchanted Lion Books</a>, I received a lovely note from a stranger named <a href=\"https://www.thesarahjacoby.com\">Sarah Jacoby</a> in response to my essay about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/08/28/margaret-wise-brown-michael-strange-poems/\">Margaret Wise Brown’s complicated love with Michael Strange</a>. Sarah told me that she too had fallen under the spell of their singular love while illustrating <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/12/12/the-important-thing-about-margaret-wise-brown/\">a picture-book biography</a> of Margaret. I ordered it and, enchanted by Sarah’s soulful watercolors and tender creatures, spontaneously invited her to illustrate my lunar story of loneliness and love on nothing more than an instinct of creative kinship. She must have felt it too because, felicitously, she said “yes.”</p>\n<p>And so <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Coziest-Place-Moon-Maria-Popova/dp/1592704379/?tag=braipick-20\">The Coziest Place on the Moon</a> (</p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1499654611\">) was born.</a>\n    </p>\n<p>This is how it begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>It was on a Tuesday in July that Re woke up feeling like the loneliest creature on Earth and decided to go live in the coziest place on the Moon.</p>\n      <p>At exactly 7:26 — a pretty number, a pretty hour — Re mounted a beam of light and sailed into space.</p>\n      <p>It took exactly 1.255 seconds, because light travels at the speed of dreams, to land exactly where Re wanted to land.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>Across Sarah’s enchanted spacescapes, Re has a surprising encounter that takes the story to where it always wanted to go — a reckoning with how to bear our loneliness and what it really means to love.</p>\n<p>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\tPublished September 12, 2025<br/>\n\t\t\t—<br/>\n\t\t\thttps://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/<br/>\n\t\t\t—\n\t\t</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/12/the-coziest-place-on-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p><strong>April Zhu: </strong>Let’s start with the charges. <i>UnHerd </i>columnist Kat Rosenfeld wrote that we editors who resigned in protest had reached with our “hot little hands” for “the censor’s pen.” According to <i>Washington Post</i> media critic Erik Wemple, we were outraged by “the humane reflections of a Jewish woman seeking reconciliation and recovery in her community.” And in <i>The Atlantic</i>, journalist and novelist Phil Klay alleged that by resigning, we had bent our literary magazine to “the narrowest polemical and moralistic approaches to literature.”</p>\n<p><strong>Sarah Khatry: </strong>It’s worth clarifying that each of us chose to resign from our volunteer positions because we believed that <i>Guernica </i>should not have published the piece in the first place. We learned of the essay only after it was published and had no part in its retraction, any more than we did in its solicitation and publication.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ: </strong>In any case, the media metabolized the upheaval of an online literary magazine into a culture war talking point.</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> And as always happens, the controversy became an opportunity to stage the same old questions: Is good literature fundamentally apolitical? Do politics make for bad art? How could art that calls for empathy ever be a thing worth protesting? Is reading itself a fundamentally moral act, one that can “build bridges” through empathy in times of strife? And a new question, or at least one that felt and continues to feel deeply urgent: What are the political and ethical responsibilities of literature and literary institutions during genocide?</p>\n<p>These questions were far above our paygrade—which was zero—as <i>Guernica </i>editors. But what <i>was </i>part of our job was weighing in on whether a nonfiction piece should be in the magazine or not.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ</strong>: The work of editing is, by design, not very visible, and the irregular way in which this particular process unfurled meant that our internal decisions were adjudicated very publicly. It also made clear that many people don’t understand what literary magazine editors do.</p>\n<p><strong>SK</strong>: In an interview with Ezra Klein last year, Adam Moss, the former editor-in-chief of <i>New York</i>, described editing as “a heightened level of sensitivity to reaction. . . And it’s not just an intellectual thing—it’s also very much an emotional thing.”</p>\n<p>At first, a reaction along two dimensions: emotional, intellectual. An editor is supposed to examine that reaction, to find its source, and to evaluate it in the context of the magazine’s identity, its house style and purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ: </strong>At <i>Guernica</i>, as at many other publications, the process of editing involved circulating a submission among many readers, each of them scanning for content and craft. Nonfiction essays were sometimes submitted directly to an editor, as Chen’s was, but more often they came in cold, from the slush pile. At least two readers read every slush submission and, if they endorsed it, would send it along with a brief memo to another round of editors, who would in turn write another memo framing the piece for discussion in an editorial meeting.</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> So much of editing is about tapping into what’s already strong about an essay, even if some of that strength is still latent. Its veins of beauty, urgency, surprise; its capacity for insight. The work of editing is recognizing these remarkable qualities and bolstering them, while stripping away other qualities that may inhibit them.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ:</strong> Let’s say Chen’s essay came in and you had to write the memo for it. What would you have written?</p>\n<p><strong>SK:</strong> Maybe something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p>This personal essay by Joanna Chen, an Israeli translator of Hebrew and Arabic, focuses on her difficulty “tread[ing] the line of empathy, to feel passion for both sides” (Israelis and Palestinians). Tonally, the essay is melancholic and generally restrained, with flashes of lyricism that do not, for me, tip into overindulgence given the weight of its subject. It begins and ends with the memory of Chen’s auntie Sheila, who instilled in Chen the significance of small but concrete acts of generosity, of “lending a hand when needed.” The essay tracks the arc of Chen’s ambivalent and often conflicting emotions in the weeks following October 7, after which she stops her volunteer work, driving Palestinian children from the border to Israeli hospitals for lifesaving medical procedures. In the midst of communal grief, Chen practices care, first for her neighbors who were victims of the October 7 attack and then also for Palestinians, by resuming her volunteer work and contacting a Palestinian friend. She reflects on what bridging both sides might look like, concluding that it feels ever more impossible during war, but committed to “still find empathy and love in this broken world.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>The memo would start like this, followed by a paragraph highlighting the essay’s shortcomings and its potential. In the paragraph I would have explained how the piece flinches from engaging with its larger historical and political context, because that context poses a threat to the neat arc of the author’s moral journey.</p>\n<p>Then, in our next editorial meeting, we would have discussed the memo as a group and decided whether to move the piece forward to publication.</p>\n<p><strong>AZ:</strong> Our inquiry always boiled down to the following question: could this become a <i>Guernica </i>essay?</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/a-document-of-complicity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When he returned, he resolved to see the mountain with fresh eyes and to keep a detailed notebook. The result is <i>The Mountain Knows the Mountain</i>, a meticulously observed experience of one fire season chronicled in <i>haibun</i>, the centuries-old prose form dating from Basho’s <i>Narrow Road to the Interior</i> that recounts both inner and outer journeys and incorporates traditional haiku as an occasional element of narrative counterpoint. Though only a beginner in the practice of haiku, Connors deftly weaves close observation, personal reflection, and memory with hard-won knowledge of the forest, of the mountain, and of fire.</p>\n    <p><i>The Mountain Knows the Mountain</i> is both mythic and immediate, a chronicle of daily events granular in their specificity but connected to larger themes of the observed world and the inner life of the observer. Connors captures the various moods of a long season on a mountain; plays with language and ways of seeing; and includes contributing perspectives from his partner, Mónica Ortiz Uribe, and his friend the late editor and publisher Bobby Byrd. Together with the author’s own simple drawings, the resulting snapshots offer incisive visions of how to be intimate with the wild.</p>\n    <p>Connors will discuss the book with writer (and fellow n+1 contributor) Nina MacLaughlin. <a href=\"https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/philip-connors-nina-maclaughlin\">RSVP via McNally Jackson</a>.</p>\n    <p><strong>Tuesday, September 16</strong><br/> <strong>7 PM</strong><br/> <strong>McNally Jackson Williamsburg 76 N 4th St Brooklyn</strong></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/events/philip-connors-and-nina-maclaughlin-in-conversation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

These days, reporters conduct much of their research before someone dies, to better highlight his or her importance. The newspaper has already decided that the deceased deserves to count among history's greats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/chroniques/906721/propos-pierre-nora\">version</a>of this column originally ran in</p>\n<p><i>Le Devoir</i>on August 4, 2025. Translated from the French by Elettra Pauletto.</p>\n<p>When I was a young reporter, I envied my elders’ ability to write obituaries of famous people. Having the last word on someone renowned seemed to me like high-end journalism, especially when it appeared in leading newspapers like <i>Le Monde </i>and<i> The New York Times</i>. These days, reporters conduct much of their research before someone dies, to better highlight his or her importance. The newspaper has already decided that the deceased deserves to count among history’s greats.</p>\n<p>This was clearly the case for French historian Pierre Nora, who died on June 2. Featured on the front page of <i>Le Monde</i> with a prominent photo of the subject, Nora was celebrated ceremoniously as “a figure of Parisian intellectual life,”—author, founder of the journal <i>Le Débat</i>, and revered at “the prestigious publishing house” Gallimard, “where he curated collections on human sciences.” “One will no longer encounter the elegant figure” of this member of the Académie Française on Rue Gaston-Gallimard, a man who “called the shots on the life of ideas in France,” who “had become the essential ‘public historian’ for journalists to call on when they needed an opinion on changes in national sentiment.”</p>\n<p>You have to dig deep into Pierre Nora’s dazzling career to find the slightest hint of anything unseemly: <i>Le Monde</i> reports that “the English essayist Perry Anderson criticized <i>Le Débat</i> for its ‘consensual blandness’” without mentioning Anderson’s leftist politics and the controversy sparked by Nora’s public refusal to translate and publish <i>The Age of Extremes</i>, a highly acclaimed book written by English historian and Marxist Eric Hobsbawm. If <i>Le Monde</i> had referenced the Hobsbawm affair, they might have been obliged to quote Serge Halimi’s preface to the 2020 French edition, in which he comments on Nora’s “editorial fatwa” against Hobsbawm: “Published in an issue of his journal <i>Le Débat</i> largely devoted to Hobsbawm’s book, his pro domo plea constitutes one of the most enlightening—and most embarrassing—texts in the contemporary history of French intellectual life. Launching an 84-page debate in a publication that one edits about a work that one has previously refused to publish, and therefore to make known, constitutes, in itself, a form of exploitation.” However, “the main intellectual oddity […] lay elsewhere. […] his plea first invoked the ‘commercial’ reasons that would have prohibited the translation of the book in France.” Nora predicted sales of around 800 books. The edition of <i>The Age of Extremes</i> published by <i>Le Monde diplomatique</i> in 1998 sold more than 50,000 copies.</p>\n<p>A narrow-minded, anti-communist ideologue who succumbed to capitalist blindness? I’m not sure, but I want to add my part to his posthumous embarrassment.</p>\n<p>In January 1971, Stanley Hoffmann, a French-American historian at Harvard University, wrote a letter to his “friend” Nora at Gallimard summarizing a manuscript by a young colleague at Columbia University, Robert Paxton, which Hoffmann considered “of the highest order. It is a comprehensive study of the Vichy regime. […] in my opinion the most brilliant contribution to date on this sad regime. Mr. Paxton has done what no French author has thought of doing: he has studied the German archives and has drawn from them an interpretation that is both irrefutable and much more sinister than anything the regime’s opponents had said about it. In the process, he demolishes years and thousands of pages of Vichyist self-justification. […] It seems to me essential that his book be published in France.”</p>\n<p>Encouraged by Hoffmann, Paxton sent his book to Nora on February 11, 1971, telling him it would be published in the United States by the prestigious publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Nora responded on June 15, writing, “Your thesis has some merit and provides very useful insights. However, as I wrote to Stanley Hoffmann, in my opinion, it would need to be reworked to be published in French by a literary publishing house, since the French people still have access to some older, but still valid works. In short, I believe your book is neither general enough nor monographic enough to be easily publishable. I imagine that this mixed character is, conversely, what will make it successful in the United States.”</p>\n<p>Not quite. The book Nora thought would be so hard to publish in France caused a sensation there and completely transformed French people’s perception of their darkest national episode—indeed, “collaboration” with the Nazi occupiers turned out to be not so much double dealing as a deliberate effort by Marshal Pétain’s government to preempt the Germans in their anti-Jewish and fascist ambitions and involve France in a “full partnership in the new European order” and to start its own “national revolution.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://harpers.org/2025/09/speaking-of-pierre-nora-john-r-macarthur-publishers-note/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>The jukebox got its start earlier than you might think, but it truly became iconic when rock ‘n’ roll took over in the 1950s</h2>\n<p>Lisa Guerriero</p>\n<p>In 1889, a San Francisco tavern called the Palais Royale debuted a hot new attraction: a modified Edison phonograph that, when a customer inserted a nickel, played music from a single wax cylinder. Electrical sound amplification was still years away, so customers had to insert stethoscope-like tubes into their ears to hear anything, ideally toweling down the tubes afterward to remove earwax ahead of the next listener.</p>\n<p>Despite this unwieldy setup, the machine reportedly brought in more than $1,000 (some $34,000 today) in less than six months, and coin-operated music machines soon proliferated in bars, at drugstores and even in new listening parlors across the country. Alas, poor sound quality meant selections couldn’t be soft or subtle, so popular offerings included such earsplitting numbers as John Philip Sousa marches and the novelty whistler John Yorke AtLee performing popular ditties of the day. By the early 1900s, the machines struggled to compete against player pianos and other automated instruments that could entertain whole venues with higher-quality audio—and without requiring patrons to stick foreign objects into their delicate ear canals.</p>\n<p>But record players continued to improve in quality and volume, and pay-to-play phonographs made a huge comeback in the 1920s, paving the way for the jukebox era. In 1927, the Automatic<br/>\nMusical Instrument Company unveiled the first amplified, multi-record coin phonograph. Jukeboxes—they took on this nickname in the 1930s in reference to African American “juke joints” of the South—introduced the world to music on demand, for far less than buying a record (and on better equipment than people had at home). The boxes also reshaped the recording industry, as labels began releasing music specifically designed for post-Prohibition barrooms and cafés. Danceable big-band numbers and tunes like the “Beer Barrel Polka” were early hits, and the irrepressible popularity of jukeboxes soon rocketed artists like swing impresario Glenn Miller to national fame, creating an audience for loud, catchy, rollicking tunes, often played on newly electrified instruments, shaping what would become country, R &amp; B and rock ’n’ roll. </p>\n<p>Jukebox operators came to account for a majority of record sales, as they frequently changed out selections to keep customers dropping nickels. Using meters within the machines, operators could track which tunes were most popular at which locations, and they programmed boxes accordingly, offering a mix of national hits and more regionally specific selections. The latter included many tunes by Black and working-class musicians, in folk genres such as country and blues that tended to get scant airplay on the radio of the day but soon found appreciative listeners on jukeboxes.</p>\n<p>By the early 1940s, about 500,000 jukeboxes dotted the country, sometimes inspiring <i>too</i> much of a ruckus: Newspapers frequently reported on bar fights over music selections and complaints about noise. Snootier critics, meanwhile, voiced more petulant grievances: “The contrivance is everywhere and is always booming its inanities,” one <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writer lamented in 1941.</p>\n<p>But jukeboxes had a chance to prove their patriotic bona fides during World War II, when they provided vital entertainment on military bases and at troops’ canteens, sometimes on machines donated by public-spirited American operators—not a single nickel required. “Not even the cacophony of war can dull the magic power of Wurlitzer Automatic Phonograph music,” boasted a 1944 ad. At the same time, a number of jukebox manufacturers, including Wurlitzer, retooled factories for weapons production.</p>\n<p>After the war, stylish and streamlined jukebox cabinets in diners let teenagers listen to rock ’n’ roll at volumes generally impossible (or at least inadvisable) to achieve at home. Jukeboxes became indelibly associated with 1950s youth culture, the songs selected as easily as ordering a diner burger or milkshake. Jukebox operators now furnished teenage canteens, modeled after the military rest spots where the boxes had helped entertain the youth of the previous decade. The format of hit-after-hit music queues also helped inspire teen-friendly Top 40 radio, replacing older formats that defaulted to playing several songs in a row by a single artist.</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of decades, jukeboxes would see their numbers dwindle as fans turned to other sources of entertainment, including increasingly high-fidelity home stereos, television and the transistor radio, where Top 40 countdowns now introduced listeners to hits. “Sound of jukebox is fading melody,” reported one Associated Press headline in 1982, estimating jukebox numbers in the United States had fallen by more than half since the 1950s, while video games became the main draw in coin-operated entertainment. Yet decades later, jukeboxes—many now digital—continue to ring out across the U.S. And the idea that public establishments should offer a curated selection of recorded music, whether individual patrons like it or not, has become nearly ubiquitous. We’re living, and listening, in a world these machines created.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>While America thronged to the jukebox, mobsters often controlled the action</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <i>By Teddy Brokaw</i>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/colorful-scandalous-true-history-machine-created-american-pop-180987173/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Photo: Phoebe d'Heurle</p><p>The Rape of the Sabine Women, an episode in which Rome’s legendary founders forcibly abducted brides from a nearby community, has been a popular subject in painting and sculpture since the Renaissance—so popular, in fact, that we may miss the brutality of the original myth. “There’s almost this sense of familiarity-blindness to these stories,” says American artist Jesse Mockrin, who depicts the Sabine drama from the perspective of the women themselves in her large-scale 2024 painting <i>The Descent</i>, one of more than 12 new works on view in a solo exhibition opening at Toronto’s Art Gallery of Ontario in September.</p><p>Riffing off 16th- and 17th-century Baroque artists like Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens, who brought new levels of technical virtuosity and theatrical flair to scenes from the Bible and mythology, Mockrin asks viewers to reconsider themes of sex, gender and violence that run through the Western canon. At the same time, she resists the contemporary cultural impulse to tear down statues and reject our past for its flaws. “I think the old masters were masters. … I feel like a fan to some extent,” she confesses. “I also feel like I can be critical of the messages inherent in those works, and conscious of trying to update them to a female perspective, in this moment.”</p><h4>Did You Know?

    "body": "<p>As the United States stood on the brink of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the urgent need for innovative military strategies to effectively confront the impending global conflict. Observing the unfolding events in Europe, he realized that defeating the Axis powers would require pioneering approaches to warfare. Roosevelt turned to William J. Donovan, a trusted advisor and former informal emissary, to develop a visionary plan for a global intelligence collection agency.</p>\n<p>Donovan, a WWI veteran, drafted the “Establishment of Service of Strategic Information,” a detailed document outlining a groundbreaking framework for a centralized intelligence organization to coordinate the entire government and gather essential data for strategic planning. In his plan, Donovan emphasized that “strategy, without reliable information, is helpless. Likewise, information is useless unless intelligently directed toward strategic purposes.”</p>\n<p>Impressed by Donovan’s insight, President Roosevelt established the Coordinator of Information (COI)—the nation’s first national intelligence agency. This marked a pivotal moment in US history, as Roosevelt’s foresight and Donovan’s strategic acumen laid the groundwork for creating an entity that would revolutionize how the United States managed conflict during peacetime and war. Operating under the President’s Executive Office, the COI collected and analyzed information crucial to national security.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Boundaries: The Transition from COI to OSS</h2>\n<p>A year later, Donovan presented a transformative proposal to restructure the COI into an organization that included covert and clandestine operations in addition to intelligence gathering. He envisioned a new hybrid organization that would shift warfighting from traditional military tactics to unconventional approaches using sabotage, espionage, guerrilla warfare, and psychological operations. Believing in Donovan’s strategic expertise, President Roosevelt approved the proposal, thus creating the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) on June 13<sup>th</sup>, 1942. The OSS would operate under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a committee of senior military leaders formed during World War II to advise the President and coordinate military efforts.</p>\n<p>Under Donovan’s leadership, the OSS bridged the realms of diplomacy, intelligence, and the military. He recruited technology, economics, psychology, and finance experts to provide specialized knowledge to military operations. Donovan firmly believed in a two-pronged strategy: physically attacking the enemy’s military forces and targeting their morale and spirit. The OSS quickly became a hotbed of innovation, employing diverse specialists, including intelligence analysts, linguists, and field operatives.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), Donovan developed a unique training methodology. He prioritized specialized training for recruits to operate behind enemy lines and carry out sabotage missions. They underwent rigorous training in organizing and supporting guerrilla and partisan resistance forces. At the core of the OSS were the Strategic Services Operations (SSO), consisting of six units, each with its specialized areas of expertise and responsibilities. Notably, units like the Special Operations (SO) and the Operational Group (OG) eventually led to the formation of the twelve-person Operational Detachment-Alpha, commonly known today as the Green Berets.</p>\n<h2>From the Shadows to the Waterfront</h2>\n<p>During Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, the OSS demonstrated its strategic prowess. OSS members infiltrated Vichy French Northwest African territory, gathering vital information about enemy forces and defenses, directly influencing the invasion’s planning. The OSS also established and maintained robust contacts with local resistance groups and the Free French forces, significantly undermining the Axis stronghold in the region. Further, through unconventional warfare, the OSS successfully disrupted enemy activities and diverted resources, hindering Axis forces from mounting an effective defense against the main invasion.</p>\n<p>However, Operation Torch also exposed some of the OSS’s shortcomings. They underestimated the resistance from the Vichy French forces, resulting in two days of intense, unexpected fighting. Additionally, they overestimated the disruptive potential of the French resistance against the Axis forces, leading to strategic missteps. Some intelligence provided by the OSS also proved to be incorrect or unreliable, causing further complications in the operation’s planning and execution. Despite these setbacks, the experiences from Operation Torch provided invaluable lessons for future operations, including Operation Jedburgh.</p>\n<p>During Operation Jedburgh, a covert operation involving clandestine activities, the OSS provided personnel, equipment, and training to three-man teams. These teams were airdropped into occupied Europe, primarily focusing on France, to disrupt German military operations, gather intelligence, and support the larger Allied campaign. Consisting of a commander, an executive officer, and a radio operator, they played a pivotal role in leading local resistance movements against the Germans and carrying out acts of sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Notably, one team member always possessed fluency in the local language, ensuring effective communication and coordination with regional allies.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing personnel and training, the OSS handled logistics, the deployment of the teams, and the ongoing supply drops. Much like in Operation Torch, the effectiveness of the teams in Operation Jedburgh varied. They successfully disrupted German communications and logistics in some regions, significantly undermining the German response to the Allied invasion. However, German countermeasures, geography, and local conditions made their efforts less effective in other areas. Nevertheless, Operation Jedburgh showcased the potential of unconventional warfare and marked a successful collaboration between the OSS, the SOE, and the Free French.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/celebrating-the-legacy-of-the-office-of-strategic-services-82-years-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>The word “Seminole” is derived from the Muscogean word <i>simanó-li</i>, or “runaway,” reflecting a common heritage, as Upper Creeks from Alabama, Lower Creeks from Georgia, other affiliated tribes and escaped African slaves all sought sanctuary in Spanish Florida. There they mixed with one another, adapted to their surroundings, traded with Britain, Spain and the United States and came to be collectively recognized as one of the Five Civilized Tribes (along with the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Creek/Muscogee) of the American Southeast. Not civilized enough for some, apparently, for when the United States acquired Florida in 1821, it began herding the Seminoles, through a succession of treaties, to progressively smaller and less desirable parts of the state. Ultimately, in 1834 federal officials set Jan. 1, 1836, as a deadline for <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/on-removing-seminoles/\">removal of the Seminoles</a> from Florida to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). When a 110-man detachment of the 4th U.S.<sup> </sup>Infantry under Brevet Maj. Francis L. Dade set out for Fort King to oversee that final removal, however, it was ambushed by 180 Seminoles led by Halpatter Tustenuggee (Alligator) on Dec. 28, 1835. The ensuing slaughter of all but two of Dade’s men marked the beginning of the longest campaign fought between the U.S. Army and American Indians, a mix of pitched battles and guerrilla warfare.</p>\n    <p>In <i>Seminole Warrior versus U.S. Soldier: Second Seminole War, 1835–</i>42 (No. 61 in Osprey’s <i>Combat</i> series) military historian Ron Field compares the tactics, arms, equipment and fighting techniques used by both sides. In addition to what whites termed the “Dade massacre,” re-examined here through a more impartial lens, Field relates two other major engagements—at Lake Okeechobee, on Christmas Day 1837, and the second of back-to-back clashes at the Loxahatchee River, on Jan. 24, 1838. </p>\n    <p>Set in what might be more appropriately called the “Wild South,” the Second Seminole War was something of a learning process for both sides. Several notable future U.S. Army figures had their first taste of Indian warfare and, for that matter, their first combat experience during the conflict, lessons they would apply during the Mexican War. The Seminoles likewise developed guerrilla tactics they would employ as scouts during the Army’s later run-ins with other tribes on the Great Plains. Backed by Osprey’s usual fine array of illustrations and maps, <i>Seminole Warrior versus U.S. Soldier </i>offers <i>Wild West </i>readers a peek at the dress rehearsal for Indian campaigns to come. </p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.historynet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/91xdazMwZL._SL1500_-1-753x1024.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>Seminole Warrior vs. U.S. Soldier</h2>\n    <p>Second Seminole War, 1835–42</p>\n    <p>By Ron Field, Osprey Publishing, 2022</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>If you buy something through our site, we might earn a commission.</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.historynet.com/seminole-warrior-vs-us-soldier-book-review-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
