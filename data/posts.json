They get in quite a good shape and the distances between their lines are much smaller, which makes them harder to play through.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Amorim, the improvements they have made there have been overlooked because of the silly mistakes they are making in conceding goals which are costing them points.</p>\n<p>When I look at some of the goals they have conceded this season, including Phil Foden's opener for City at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, they are down to selection issues, and players being used in the wrong position, rather than the system itself.</p>\n<p>Haaland scores twice as Man City cruise to win against Man Utd</p>\n<h2>'A simple run by Foden was all it took'</h2>\n<p>In the first half against City, United did well. They won the ball back four or five times high up the pitch and, with a bit more finesse in those counter-attacks, they could have scored themselves.</p>\n<p>One of the problems with Amorim's 3-4-2-1 is the two holding midfielders can be outnumbered but that did not happen at Etihad Stadium because Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, who were playing either side of Benjamin Sesko, dropped in.</p>\n<p>The team narrowed up which helped Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, because there were no big gaps.</p>\n<p>Most of the time the defence and the midfield were close to each other too, rather than the defence dropping off like they did last season because of a lack of pace or confidence.</p>\n<p>City did not completely play through them and tear them apart, and that's not how they scored their first goal either.</p>\n<p>What happened there is that you have got Fernandes, arguably one of the best number 10s in the world, playing in a deeper centre-midfield role as a number eight when his instincts are not defensive.</p>\n<p>A simple run off the back from Foden was all it took to lose him.</p>\n<p>Bruno Fernandes was watching Jeremy Doku, not Phil Foden when the Belgian winger reached the byeline</p>\n<p>Yes, you could argue Luke Shaw might have done better when the ball was in the box but Foden is free by that point, because Fernandes switched off.</p>\n<p>As I highlighted on Match of the Day, he is ball-watching when the cross comes over. I don't think he is lazy, because he is back in position.</p>\n<p>He is just not used to spotting runners and seeing danger.</p>\n<p>Doku put over a cross and found the unmarked Foden who was bursting into the box</p>\n<p>That's the second time he has cost United a goal this season, because he also failed to track Emile Smith Rowe for Fulham's equaliser when they dropped points at Craven Cottage in August.</p>\n<p>The irony with Fernandes against City was that certain aspects of his play in the middle of the pitch were extremely good.</p>\n<p>It's not a totally stupid idea to play him there, because his passing from deep is tremendous to find the runners ahead of him, and he is technically excellent as well as being brave on the ball.</p>\n<p>The problem is what happens without it. A player of his intelligence should be able to learn to switch on a bit more in defensive situations too, but it's clearly not happening.</p>\n<p>You just can't play in that role if that's a regular occurrence for you, and it is down to the manager to recognise that and put players in there who do it better.</p>\n<h2>More square pegs in round holes?</h2>\n<p>Man Utd a team with round pegs in square holes - analysis</p>\n<p>Fernandes is not the only United player I look at and think he is a square peg in a round hole.</p>\n<p>Shaw has played in a back three before but he has spent the majority of his career as a dynamic left-back and it feels like he is being shoe-horned into a centre-back position under Amorim.</p>\n<p>Again you can argue he should have the quality to adapt, and for Jeremy Doku to beat him so easily for the first goal was poor defending whether you are a left-back or a centre-half, but if any players are not completely comfortable in their roles, then it is going to affect the team.</p>\n<p>For City's second goal, again it was not down to the United system failing, more a mixture of things - and a multitude of individual mistakes.</p>\n<p>Ugarte starts off on Foden but then follows the ball, like he did in the City move that led to their opener, and goes to press Nico O'Reilly, leaving Foden free.</p>\n<p>From there it's a knock-on effect.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx2x70gqllro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <i>Warning: Contains disturbing content and graphic descriptions of sexual acts</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>A man running a sex ring operating out of Dubai's most glamorous neighbourhoods, and exploiting vulnerable women, has been identified by a BBC investigation.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Charles Mwesigwa, who says he is a former London bus driver, told our undercover reporter he could provide women for a sex party at a starting price of $1,000 (£740), adding that many can do \"pretty much everything\" clients want them to.</p>\n<p>Rumours of wild sex parties in the UAE emirate have circulated for years. The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.</p>\n<p>Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.</p>\n<p>Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels.</p>\n<p>At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.</p>\n<p>We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Outside of the UK you can</strong>\n        <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OboT09uRw6M\">watch on YouTube</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n<p>One of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda.</p>\n<p>She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022.</p>\n<p>\"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us.</p>\n<p>Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.</p>\n<p>\"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled.</p>\n<p>\"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia.</p>\n<p>\"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you.\"</p>\n<p>Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her.</p>\n<p>Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes.</p>\n<p>\"There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,\" she explained quietly.</p>\n<p>Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying \"porta potty\" requests were frequent.</p>\n<p>\"There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'\" for being recorded eating faeces.</p>\n<p>Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish.</p>\n<p>\"Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person.\"</p>\n<p>Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: \"You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up.\"</p>\n<p>We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply.</p>\n<p>Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations.</p>\n<p>Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media.</p>\n<p>But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle.</p>\n<p>To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties.</p>\n<p>Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business.</p>\n<p>\"We've got like 25 girls,\" he said. \"Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything.\"</p>\n<p>He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for \"crazy stuff\". He invited our reporter for a \"sample night\".</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r9y3kxy9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When Shahnaz went into labour, her husband Abdul called a taxi to take them to the only medical facility accessible to them.</p>\n<p>\"She was in a lot pain,\" he says.</p>\n<p>A 20-minute drive away, the clinic was in Shesh Pol village in Afghanistan's north-eastern Badakhshan province. It was where their two older children were born.</p>\n<p>Abdul sat next to Shahnaz comforting her as they drove over gravel tracks to reach help.</p>\n<p>\"But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed. I didn't know it had shut down,\" he said, his face crumpling with agony.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Warning: Readers may find some details in this article distressing.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>\n<p>A single-storey structure with four small rooms, white paint peeling off its walls, the Shesh Pol clinic has USAID posters tacked up everywhere with information and guidance for pregnant women and new mothers.</p>\n<p>It doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider programme implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.</p>\n<p>It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month. It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services.</p>\n<p>Other medical facilities are simply too far from Abdul's village, and it was not without risk for Shahnaz to travel on bumpy roads. Abdul also didn't have money to pay for a longer journey - renting the taxi cost 1,000 Afghani ($14.65; £12.70), roughly a quarter of his monthly income as a labourer. So they decided to return home.</p>\n<p>\"But the baby was coming and we had to stop by the side of the road,\" Abdul said.</p>\n<p>Shahnaz delivered their baby girl in the car. Shortly after, she died, bleeding profusely. A few hours later, before she could be named, their baby also died.</p>\n<p>\"I wept and screamed. My wife and child could've been saved if the clinic was open,\" said Abdul. \"We had a hard life, but we were living it together. I was always happy when I was with her.\"</p>\n<p>He doesn't even have a photo of Shahnaz to hold on to.</p>\n<p>There's no certainty the mother and baby would've survived if they'd been treated at the clinic, but without it, they didn't stand a chance, underlining the undeniable impact of US aid cuts in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>For decades, America has been the largest donor to Afghanistan, and in 2024, US funds made up a staggering 43% of all aid coming into the country.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has justified withdrawing it, saying there were \"credible and longstanding concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including... the Taliban\", who govern the country. The US government further added that <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-april-8-2025\">they had reports stating</a> that at least $11m were \"being siphoned or enriching the Taliban\".</p>\n<p>The report that the US State Department referenced <a href=\"https://www.sigar.mil/Reports/Category/24950/\">was made by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction</a> (SIGAR). It said that $10.9m of US taxpayer money had been paid to the Taliban-controlled government by partners of USAID in \"taxes, fees, duties, or utilities\".</p>\n<p>The Taliban government denies that aid money was going into their hands.</p>\n<p>\"This allegation is not true. The aid is given to the UN, and through them to NGOs in provinces. They identify who needs the aid, and they distribute it themselves. The government is not involved,\" said Suhail Shaheen, the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha.</p>\n<p>The Taliban government's policies, especially its restrictions on women, the harshest in the world, have meant that after four years in power, it is still not recognised by most of the world. It's also a key reason donors have been increasingly walking away from the country.</p>\n<p>The US insists no one has died because of aid cuts. Shahnaz and her baby's deaths are not recorded anywhere. Neither are countless others.</p>\n<p>The BBC has documented at least half a dozen first-hand, devastating accounts in areas where USAID-supported clinics have shut down.</p>\n<p>Right next to Shahnaz's grave, villagers who had gathered around us pointed to two other graves. They told us both were of women who died in childbirth in the past four months – Daulat Begi and Javhar. Their babies survived.</p>\n<p>Not far from the graveyard, we met Khan Mohammad whose wife, 36-year-old Gul Jan, died in childbirth five months ago. Their baby boy Safiullah died three days later.</p>\n<p>\"When she became pregnant, she would go to the clinic for check-ups. But midway through her pregnancy it shut down. During the delivery she had a lot of pain and blood loss,\" Khan Mohammad said. \"My children are sad all the time. No one can give them the love of a mother. I miss her every day. We had a sweet and loving life together.\"</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgqdneev1no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The nights are drawing in, the tans are fading and we all need a bit of sparkle in our lives as we head into autumn.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Never fear, Strictly Come Dancing is back with its 23rd series, with 15 new contestants ready to dust off their dancing shoes.</p>\n<p>Following last year's <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz47pp1qwl7o\">controversies relating to the behaviour of some professional dancers</a>, plus a recently launched <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ge98v7j80o\">investigation into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3p58rm8go\">unnamed star being arrested on suspicion of rape</a> (it is understood the development is not related to the upcoming series), BBC bosses will be keen for fans and media to return to talking about the show itself.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, the press gathered for an annual event which gives journalists a chance to speak to all the contestants ahead of the show launch (well, almost all, more on that later).</p>\n<p>Here's all the behind-the-scenes gossip we found out from the likes of Dani Dyer, Vicky Pattison and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.</p>\n<h2>On being 'Strictified'</h2>\n<p>One of the big attractions for most celebrity contestants on the show is the chance to glam up to the max every Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Former Love Island star Dani Dyer says she's game for any dance costume.</p>\n<p>\"I can't wait to be a bit sexy, I've been a mum... my oldest is four... am I sexy?,\" she giggles.</p>\n<p>\"On Love Island I never wore the thong bikinis and now I'm like 'Why didn't I do that?\"</p>\n<p>Dani in a carnival thong number for the samba? You heard it here first.</p>\n<p>La Voix, who competed in the 2024 series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, arrives at the press event in full make-up with trademark coiffured hair-do. How on earth can you \"Strictify\" a drag performer?</p>\n<p>\"I might be the only one that dresses down on a live show! I want the full Strictly experience. They're going to take it to the next level. They have already – I've been lucky enough to have seen my first dress.</p>\n<p>\"The glamour is wonderful, I feel like I'm living my dream. I don't want to do the dancing, just the dressing up bit!\"</p>\n<h2>Keeping control of the nerves</h2>\n<p>Former Geordie Shore star and podcast host Vicky Pattison has always been very open about her struggles with anxiety, recently revealing on her podcast Get A Grip that she had gone back to therapy to deal with Strictly nerves.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone's handling me with kid gloves at the moment, I keep getting loads of cuddles off everyone.</p>\n<p>\"I'm scared, a little bit overwhelmed. I think it's because I've wanted to do this show for so long, I'm a big fan. I'm desperate to make the most of it... but I'm worried I'll get in my own head.\"</p>\n<p>But support from the likes of former contestants Pete Wicks and her podcast co-host Angela Scanlon is helping.</p>\n<p>\"With Pete, our careers, there's a lot of parallels, we both come from reality TV and there's this common misconception that we're not very talented or capable of anything. I would really like to change that narrative. Pete just said be yourself.</p>\n<p>\"I just need to get a handle on myself and put my big girl pants on. I'll kick myself if I'm in my own head the whole time and I don't enjoy it. I think I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself.\"</p>\n<p>Social media star George Clarke says the nerves haven't hit him - yet.</p>\n<p>\"I don't really get nervous until it's just about to happen, which is nice, until it's just about to happen! Nice build-up and then a breakdown in the dressing room!\"</p>\n<p>Model, actress and influencer Ellie Goldstein says she's \"excited and nervous but nerves are good. I'm so competitive, I want to win!\"</p>\n<p>And Dani's famous dad Danny Dyer will be cheering her on.</p>\n<p>\"Dad is so excited for me, he loves the show. He came to support when Rose Ayling Ellis (his on-screen daughter in EastEnders) was doing it and it was emotional then. He loves a dance himself. I should get him up!\"</p>\n<h2>The Strictly curse</h2>\n<p>None of the contestants seemed bothered about the so-called Strictly curse, which refers to several former contestants who were already in relationships and ended up finding romance with fellow participants.</p>\n<p>In fact, La Voix jokes: \"Bring it on, I'm single!\"</p>\n<p>Dyer points to the fact she's only just got married earlier this year (to West Ham footballer Jarrod Bowen), so has no concerns.</p>\n<p>ER and Doctor Who actress Alex Kingston quips: \"I'm at the age where I don't have to worry about that!\" Come on Alex, 62 is nothing these days.</p>\n<p>Former footballer and manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink says his wife won't be bothered in the slightest.</p>\n<p>\"Take him, take the old fart, take him!\"</p>\n<h2>Thomas is a no-show</h2>\n<p>Sadly, we didn't get the chance to chat to former Apprentice star and social media personality Thomas Skinner, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1l8vnzmeqpo\">later apologised for picking up a journalist's phone before he walked out of the event.</a></p>\n<p>But Thomas also made it clear that he is staying on the line-up, stressing that he \"can't wait to give it my all on that dancefloor\".</p>\n<p>He'll no doubt be keen for his feet to do the talking from now on.</p>\n<h2>Does previous dance experience <i>really</i> help?</h2>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33r4j2elldo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Last week, the prime minister unveiled the first series of \"nation-building\" projects that Ottawa will review for fast-track approvals - a key part of his wider economic agenda.</p>\n<p>They include a plan to double production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a British Columbia plant, the expansion of part of Montreal's port, and building a small modular nuclear reactor in Ontario.</p>\n<p>Carney has also announced $13bn (£6.9bn, $9.4bn) for a new federal housing agency to help build new homes, and vowed to diversify trade away from the US.</p>\n<p>In politics it's usually prudent to under-promise and over-deliver, said Marci Surkes, chief strategy officer at public affairs firm Compass Rose and a former policy director to Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau.</p>\n<p>\"Mr Carney has taken quite a different tack, where he has really set the bar very high in terms of expectations,\" she said.</p>\n<p>She added: \"There's already impatience from those who are waiting to see results.\"</p>\n<h2>Economic woes surpass Trump fears</h2>\n<p>Anxiety around an unpredictable US president helped propel Carney to power last April.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump has since imposed punishing tariffs on some sectors of the economy, like steel and autos, but has granted a majority of Canadian goods a broad tariff exemption under the current US-Mexico-Canada free trade deal.</p>\n<p>Mr Dallaire said Canadians know it won't be \"an easy ride\" for the next few years.</p>\n<p>\"The question has turned to: 'OK, what now?'\"</p>\n<p>Recent opinion polling suggests that voters are feeling less panicked by Trump but increasingly worried about the economy.</p>\n<p>Canada's unemployment rate rose to 7.1% last month, a level not seen since 2016, excluding the pandemic, and economic growth slowed sharply over the summer, contracting by 1.6%.</p>\n<p>A poll released by Abacus Data this month indicates that six in 10 respondents felt the Ottawa government was too focused on the US president at the expense of pressing concerns like housing, healthcare, and affordability.</p>\n<p>Still, for Carney, there's some silver lining. Many don't blame him directly for the economic shocks of Trump's policies - but they will be watching how the prime minister navigates what he has called a \"rupture\" in the global economy.</p>\n<p>\"A souring economy will become a drag on the popularity of the government, but it really depends to what extent it happens and to what extent Canadians see visible changes,\" said Mr Dallaire.</p>\n<h2>An opposition leader back in the saddle</h2>\n<p>Pierre Poilievre is making his return to the House of Commons.</p>\n<p>The Conservative leader lost his long-held seat in the April election to a Liberal challenger and was forced to spend his summer seeking a path back to parliament.</p>\n<p>In August, he won a by-election in Alberta, securing a new seat and a chance to be a foil for Carney in the House.</p>\n<p>\"The real fighting match is about to begin, and Mr Carney is going to have to swat away or figure out how to handle the punches that will be coming at him,\" said Ms Surkes.</p>\n<p>In an open letter to Carney last week, Poilievre set the stage, saying: \"So far, you have been judged only by the lofty things you have promised to do one day, not by what you have done.\"</p>\n<p>Poilievre has sharply focused his message on cost-of-living and crime issues and he plans to target the Liberals - who have been in power since 2015 - on their record, as well as on immigration.</p>\n<p>That includes pushing them on the number of temporary foreign workers allowed into the country, a programme that has seen a significant expansion in recent years.</p>\n<h2>An 'austerity' warning</h2>\n<p>An \"austerity and investment\" federal budget is expected later this autumn - a financial balancing act Carney has said is possible with \"discipline\".</p>\n<p>The prime minister has criticised government spending under Trudeau as \"unsustainable\" and has asked his finance minister to find programme spending cuts across departments that would increase to 15% reductions over the next three years.</p>\n<p>\"We need to rein in spending. We need to find efficiencies,\" Carney has said.</p>\n<p>But the prime minister will also have to find a way to deliver on major commitments, including a multi-billion dollar increase in defence spending promised to Nato partners, notably the US.</p>\n<p>It comes amid lower revenues from tariffs and other financial challenges, likely leaving officials \"shaking every couch cushion loose for change\", said Ms Surkes.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2700vzrko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
