    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>What was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?</h1>\n    <p>The state banquet is the spectacular showstopper of a state visit, a glittering feast with speeches, royal toasts, trumpet fanfares and fancy food and wine.</p>\n    <p>It's diplomacy served up with fine dining. A cut-glass shock-and-awe approach to hospitality designed to make a visiting leader like President Trump feel special.</p>\n    <p>The setting in St George's Hall inside Windsor Castle is a remarkable sight, a mix of medieval banquet and Harry Potter film.</p>\n    <p>Elaborately uniformed staff around the hall are as drilled as the soldiers who have been on parade during the day. The table settings, five glasses per person, are terrifyingly neat.</p>\n    <p>For Trump's visit, the 160 guests, sitting behind 1,452 pieces of cutlery, were eating from a menu, written in French, which translates as:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hampshire Watercress Panna Cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad</li>\n      <li>Organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savoury infused jus</li>\n      <li>Vanilla ice cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached Victoria plums</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Guests had a generous wine list.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wiston Estate, Cuvée, 2016</li>\n      <li>Domaine Bonneau de Martray, Corton-Charlemagne, Grand Cru, 2018</li>\n      <li>Ridge Vineyards, Monte Bello, 2000</li>\n      <li>Pol Roger, Extra Cuvée de Réserve, 1998</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>After-dinner drinks were drowning in symbolism. It's a 1945 vintage port, in honour of Trump having been the 45th US president, although he does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    <p>There was a 1912 cognac, from the birth year of the president's Scottish-born mother.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/766c/live/3adc1640-93f8-11f0-8750-ed240c52ff67.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media A place settings at the banquet table reads THE KING and has gold cutlery next to it\"/>\n    <p>If that doesn't seem enough there was a special cocktail, the Transatlantic Whisky Sour, which blends Johnnie Walker with the bright citrus of marmalade, with pecan foam and a toasted marshmallow on a biscuit.</p>\n    <h2>Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook</h2>\n    <p>President Trump's banquet in Windsor Castle was conspicuously missing celebrity faces or screen stars. Were there people in Hollywood, or even west London, who suddenly found they had to be somewhere else tonight?</p>\n    <p>There's not even a hardy royal perennial like Sir David Beckham or Sir Elton John.</p>\n    <p>Instead the guest list was heavy on political operators and tech bros. Apple boss <strong>Tim Cook</strong> was there, sitting next to the president's daughter, <strong>Tiffany Trump</strong>.</p>\n    <p>Press baron <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> was sitting next to Sir Keir Starmer's key adviser <strong>Morgan McSweeney</strong>. The small talk must be interesting when Trump is suing the Murdoch press for billions in the US.</p>\n    <p>Like at a wedding, guests must be checking the nameplates around the ornately-decorated table to see who they're sitting beside.</p>\n    <p>The \"head\" of the table is in the middle for the Windsor state banquet, with the King and president in the centre of a dining table that is 47m long.</p>\n    <p>President Trump, as the guest of honour, was placed between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales.</p>\n    <p>The nameplate for Trump said \"President of the United States of America\", although in capital letters, oddly reminiscent of his social media messages.</p>\n    <p>Facing them is the first lady, whose nameplate says \"Mrs Trump\", with Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales on either side of her.</p>\n    <p>The seating arrangement threw up some interesting groupings. There was the <strong>US ambassador</strong> <strong>Warren Stephens</strong> flanked by <strong>Princess Anne</strong> on one side and <strong>Chancellor Rachel Reeves</strong> on the other.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> was beside <strong>Stephen Schwarzman, </strong>mega-wealthy CEO of the Blackstone investment group. If Conservative leader <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> was searching for ideas, she was sitting next to <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, chief executive of the artificial intelligence firm, OpenAI.</p>\n    <p>The US Secretary of State <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> was there and Trump's special envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong>. Among UK politicians Foreign Secretary <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> and Deputy Prime Minister <strong>David Lammy</strong> were there.</p>\n    <p>Golfer <strong>Nick Faldo</strong> and athlete <strong>Dame Katherine Grainger</strong> were among the more prominent sports stars at the banquet.</p>\n    <p><strong>Jensen Huang, </strong>chief executive<strong> </strong>of Nvidia, was one of the tech contingent.</p>\n    <p>On the walls are royal portraits and suits of armour and the ceiling is studded with the coats of arms of Knights of the Garter.</p>\n    <p>St George's Hall was rebuilt after the fire of 1992. So perhaps like many stories about the royals, it feels new and old at the same time.</p>\n    <p>According to the travelling US press pack, the choice of music at the banquet reflected some of President Trump's favourites. Maybe they have their own messages to the politicians listening.</p>\n    <p>It includes Nessun Dorma, meaning \"none shall sleep\" and You Can't Always Get What You Want.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef34/live/a99f61b0-109d-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, purple banner promoting the Royal Watch newsletter with text saying, “Insider stories and expert analysis in your inbox every week”.

Representatives for Kimmel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n    <p>Kimmel said on Monday: \"The Maga Gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"</p>\n    <p>The late-night host also criticised flags being flown at half mast in honour of Kirk, and mocked the president's reaction to the shooting.</p>\n    <p>\"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a gold fish,\" Kimmel said.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after ABC announced the host had been suspended, Trump, who has criticised him on multiple occasions, said it was \"great news for America\".</p>\n    <p>\"The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\"the president wrote in a social media post.</p>\n    <p>Trump then criticised two other late-night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and and Seth Myers, who he described as \"two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, said on a podcast that Kimmel's remarks showed \"the sickest conduct possible\" as he urged Disney to take action.</p>\n    <p>\"[Broadcasters] have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,\" said Carr, who is a Trump-appointee.</p>\n    <p>\"Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead,\" Carr told The Benny Show.</p>\n    <p>He noted that an apology from Kimmel would be a \"very reasonable, minimal step\".</p>\n    <p>The ABC announcement came just after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar Media, said it would not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show\".</p>\n    <p>Nexstar said the comedian's remarks about Kirk \"are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse\".</p>\n    <p>\"[We] do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division.</p>\n    <p>\"Continuing to give Mr Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to pre-empt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.\"</p>\n    <p>Following the programme's suspension, Carr thanked Nexstar \"for doing the right thing\" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead.</p>\n    <p>Authorities have not specified a motive in Kirk's fatal shooting on 10 September. Tyler Robinson has been charged over the killing and is facing the death penalty if convicted at trial.</p>\n    <p>Charging documents said the suspect's mother \"explained that over the last year or so, Robinson had become political and started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented\".</p>\n    <p>The court papers say that when the suspect's parents asked him why he had targeted Kirk, he told them the conservative activist \"spreads too much hate\".</p>\n    <p>Robinson was not registered to any political party and did not vote in the 2022 or 2024 elections. He was not old enough to vote in the 2020 election.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.</p>\n    <p>At the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to \"obtain and securely transfer\" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.</p>\n    <p>She did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to \"political considerations\".</p>\n    <p>\"They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Navalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: \"'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'\"</p>\n    <p>\"But I have grounds.

Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.</p>\n    <p>Navalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.</p>\n    <p>Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68595334\">briefly referred to him a month after his death</a> by stating that a person passing was \"always a sad event\".</p>\n    <p>The Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and \"some people\" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia.</p>\n    <p>\"But such is life.

Jewels! Dresses! Tiaras!</p>\n    <p>State visits are as much about what everyone is wearing as they are about what they’re saying and doing.</p>\n    <p>It is an exercise in fashion diplomacy - and there has been plenty of it on display as US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania visit the UK.</p>\n    <p>From the First Lady's hat and striking yellow banquet dress, to the Princess of Wales's golden gown and historic tiara, here are some of the most eye-catching looks.</p>\n    <h2>A striking yellow dress</h2>\n    <p>At Wednesday night's formal state banquet, Melania went bold.</p>\n    <p>Yellow. And a baby pink belt.</p>\n    <p>The strapless floor length, long-sleeved dress by Carolina Herrera is nothing short of a statement.</p>\n    <p>Gone was the hat, so for the first time on Wednesday, we saw her full face. She wore her hair down, and completed the look with sparkling, dangly earrings.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f814/live/7beba300-93fb-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Phil Noble/Reuters Donald Trump wears a white tie dress code - a black tailcoat and trousers, a white dress shirt with a wing collar, a white waistcoat, and a white bow tie. Melania Trump wears a floor-length flowing yellow dress with a straight-across neck line exposing her shoulders. The dress is taken in by a thick bright pink belt styled with a pink buckle at the front.\"/>\n    <p>For Marian Kwei, a celebrity stylist and Vogue contributor, Melania's gown was \"not the expected colour to see at a high state banquet\".</p>\n    <p>\"Although it perhaps is in keeping with state dress protocol, the strapless gown is a little on the daring side,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>It is not the first time we have seen Melania wear a strapless crepe gown for evening dress, however. She donned a similar design for her first dance following President Trump's inauguration in January.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/07b4/live/99d2aa80-93fb-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Britain's Queen Camilla, King Charles, U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump pose for a family photo at the State Banquet during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, at Windsor Castle, in Windsor, Britain, September 17, 2025\"/>\n    <p>The Queen, 78, attended the evening banquet wearing a royal blue, silk, marocain embroidered dress by Fiona Clare, a sapphire and diamond tiara, and the King's Family Order.</p>\n    <p>King Charles's regalia was in keeping with the high pomp and pageantry that we would expect of a state banquet.</p>\n    <p>He wore a formal tuxedo, looking \"every inch the monarch\", noted Kwei.</p>\n    <p>The King, 76, completed his look with a royal blue sash - a colour that matched Camilla's dress.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile President Trump, 79, dressed the part for the evening's event in white tie.</p>\n    <h2>Timeless suit - and a statement hat</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a94b/live/41962940-9406-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Andrew Matthews/Reuters Melania wears a military-style grey coat and is seen with the now iconic purple hat on Wednesday daytime\"/>\n    <p>Melania, 55, is no stranger to impressive headwear - her white and navy wide-brimmed hat was a talking point at her husband's inauguration earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>There was even an awkward moment when <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cz9e5y9vlwzo\">Trump tried to kiss her</a> and the brim of her hat made it a tricky task. Cue the internet blowing up.</p>\n    <p>The first lady went for a similarly dramatic flourish during the first official events on Wednesday. She arrived at Windsor Castle wearing a wide-brimmed purple hat that seemed to obscure her eyes, which she paired with a timeless, dark grey suit by Dior.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f813/live/2055f560-93ea-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"PA Media (L-R) Catherine, Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla and First Lady Melania Trump arrive for a state visit at Windsor Castle\"/>\n    <p>\"Melania's hat is not by chance,\" said Kwei.</p>\n    <p>\"The hat with the wide brim that hides her face is pointing to a stance where she wants all eyes on her husband and his agenda while here,\" she added.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8926/live/39529870-93ea-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters Melania Trump and Britain's Queen Camilla view the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle\"/>\n    <p>Kwei noted that Melania’s hat matched the exact colour of Trump's tie, in \"a nod to her support for her husband's agenda during this state visit\".</p>\n    <p>Dior is a favourite fashion house for Melania, and, for Kwei, her decision to wear it is a nod to America's support for Europe.</p>\n    <h2>Catherine's golden gown</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5799/live/507fcd80-93fc-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Phil Noble/Reuters The Prince of Wales is in the traditional white tie dress code and he is decorated with his royal orders and regalia.

She is wearing a Lover's Knot tiara.\"/>\n    <p>For the state banquet on Wednesday evening, the Princess of Wales wore a couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley with a full-length, hand-embroidered, gold Chantilly lace evening coat over a silk crepe gown.</p>\n    <p>The coat featured hand-embroidered roses with couched gold cording, accented with French knots and satin-stitched blooms.</p>\n    <p>The 43-year-old completed her look with the Lover's Knot Tiara.</p>\n    <p>\"Formal state banquets are one of the rare occasions when royals wear tiaras,\" said Kwei.</p>\n    <p>\"Kate is wearing her favourite tiara, which is no surprise. It was a favourite of Princess Diana, and originally belonged to Queen Mary.\"</p>\n    <p>\"This is a really show-stopping dress and for me it really fits with the theme of this State Visit being extra,\" royal expert Victoria Murphy added.</p>\n    <p>She noted that gold isn't a colour we see Catherine wear a lot.</p>\n    <p>\"But when she has worn it in the past, for example for [film] premieres, it has always been a real red-carpet moment,\" Murphy added.</p>\n    <p>The dress code for the state banquet is white tie, and the Prince of Wales, 43, did not disappoint.</p>\n    <p>He was decked out in formal regalia and his orders, and wore an elegant Windsor tail coat.</p>\n    <p>\"This is William at his most formal,\" said Murphy.</p>\n    <p>She noted that on day-to-day engagements, the younger royals, in particular, can often be quite informal - but for an occasion like this, they pull out all the stops.</p>\n    <p>\"The formality is all part of honouring the visiting guest,\" she said.</p>\n    <h2>A British classic</h2>\n    <p>On Tuesday night, Melania stepped onto UK soil wearing the most British of fashion items: a Burberry trench coat.</p>\n    <p>She wore the honey-coloured, floor-length coat with the collar turned up, while flashes of its signature lining were visible underneath.</p>\n    <p>Melania completed the look with black sunglasses and boots.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61cb/live/783f9520-93b2-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are welcomed by Viscount Henry Hood upon arrival at London Stansted Airport for a state visit to Britain, near London, Britain, September 16, 2025. \"/>\n    <p>Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic at The New York Times, said that wearing a British-made coat could be an example of engaging in sartorial diplomacy, which is something many first ladies have done.</p>\n    <p>For the Trumps' last state visit in 2019, Melania - a former model - also dressed in her British best, opting for brands such as Burberry, although she added a mix of European fashion houses too (think Celine and Dolce &amp; Gabbana), as well as American designers including Michael Kors.</p>\n    <p>It will be interesting to see how the choice of a British brand on this trip will be perceived back at home, says Kwei, given that Trump's message is about serving the interests of the United States before those of any other country.</p>\n    <h2>Matching in blue</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7f21/live/8878a550-93bf-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Britain's King Charles III and Britain's Queen Camilla during a Ceremonial Welcome in the Quadrangle at Windsor Castle&#10;&#10;\"/>\n    <p>The Queen was seen during the day in a vibrant, sapphire blue dress, a matching coat by Fiona Clare and hat by Philip Treacy.</p>\n    <p>She completed the look with a sapphire and diamond brooch.</p>\n    <p>The Queen was matching with her husband, King Charles, who wore a blue suit and pale blue tie at the daytime events.</p>\n    <h2>A diplomatic message</h2>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d2d5/live/105ad000-93c6-11f0-98dc-53d10dedbfc6.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Catherine, Princess of Wales, smiles as she greets their guests on the Windsor Estate, in Windsor\"/>\n    <p>The Princess of Wales wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat by Jane Taylor to greet the US president and first lady on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>From both the Queen and the Princess, it's a strong showing for British designers.</p>\n    <p>Catherine completed her look with a feather brooch.</p>\n    <p>Kwei noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband William, who wore a burgundy tie.</p>\n    <p>\"As with Melania, this is to show support and that she's at one with her spouse and home country's agenda,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"Blue and red!,\" royal expert Murphy said of the outfit choices by the Queen and Catherine.</p>\n    <p>\"This seems a clear example of coordinated diplomatic dressing to me, to reflect the US flag.</p>\n    <p>\"It's an example of how the outfits can send a powerful diplomatic message.\"</p>\n    <h2>More on Trump's state visit</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cx2q200d2vnt\">LIVE: Follow the latest from Trump's state visit to UK</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rynvlm6zjo\">What is the president doing during his visit?</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80gk8j8epvo\">ANALYSIS: Focus on pageantry after Starmer's tough fortnight</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0x2vxl7gjo\">America's unofficial party house where presidents stay in London</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c9dxq447dwvo\">WATCH: BBC correspondents on relationship between PM and president</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-aa033245-35e9-45e2-9209-616ebce4b971\">Security measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The Beast</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy857ddpjp4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.</p>\n    <p>As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, the visits are used by governments to further Britain's interests.</p>\n    <p>Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush.</p>\n    <p>However, in February <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxxpxe5qko\">Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles</a> during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal.

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>Just one stumbling block for one migrant? Or something much more serious which threatens the government's approach to small boats?</p>\n    <p>Those are the questions being posed in government now after a 25-year-old Eritrean man managed to block the government from putting him on a flight to France at the High Court on Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>It is just a temporary decision. The judge granted a pause of at least 14 days so the man, who is not being named for legal reasons and arrived in the UK on a small boat last month, could provide evidence of his claim that he has been a victim of modern day slavery.</p>\n    <p>But it is certainly frustrating for a government which had hoped that the removal flights to France under the 'one in, one out' scheme would begin this week.</p>\n    <p>They may still do so. Either way, the steady drumbeat of people being put on flights through the week appears not to have materialised.</p>\n    <p>The stumbling blocks with Tuesday's case show how complicated quick turn-around deportation or removal plans can be.</p>\n    <p>And in this case, they concern the UK's laws on modern day slavery and trafficking - and the way the Home Office handles these cases.</p>\n    <p>After the man arrived on a small boat in August, officials swiftly rejected his case and told him he could and should have claimed asylum in France.</p>\n    <p>But he also asked for protection as a victim of modern day slavery, saying he has suffered harm in Libya, long before he came to the UK.</p>\n    <p>There was no evidence he was trafficked across the Channel, not least because his mother had paid smugglers about £1,000 to take him.</p>\n    <p>Now, here's the important twist.</p>\n    <p>The Home Office's trafficking assessors - different officials to the team organising removal flights - said the Eritrean man's story was weak.</p>\n    <p>But that rejection was not their final decision. The UK's rules allow a rejected applicant to ask for a reconsideration.</p>\n    <p>The senior judge dealing with the case repeatedly asked the man's lawyers why he could not make those representations from France, including gathering any medical evidence.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4dca/live/eb7bf820-93d6-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far. Each year is represented by a line which tracks the numbers from January to December. 2021 saw the lowest of the five years, at 28,526 and 2022 saw the highest with 45,774. As at 8 September the total for 2025 is 30,164 which is the highest for that point in the year of any of the others.\"/>\n    <p>It looked and sounded like the Home Office was going to win.</p>\n    <p>But then, as the courtroom battle dragged on, the department's own trafficking officials effectively confirmed that they would not expect the man to do that.</p>\n    <p>That fatally undermined any hope the home secretary had of getting this 25-year-old on the 9am flight from London Heathrow.</p>\n    <p>If the Home Office wasn't such a secure bomb-proof building, we might have been able to hear howls from its ministerial corridors echo around the Royal Courts of Justice, two miles away.</p>\n    <p>So where does this decision leave the project?</p>\n    <p>This single decision does not kill the France returns plan, but it's symptomatic of a decades-long criticism, that the Home Office regularly snatches defeat from the jaws of victory thanks to epic levels of dysfunction.</p>\n    <p>Yes, the government never committed publicly to flights in the air this week. But in private, there was a strong expectation from those around Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, of a string of departures this week.</p>\n    <p>But immigration is complicated - really complicated - and the awkwardness of Tuesday's injunction aside, officials know other English Channel crossers may mount similar arguments.</p>\n    <p>The government's own KC argued in court that if the judge blocked this removal, as he went on to do, then \"the deterrent effect of this policy will be undermined\".</p>\n    <p>Anyone who presents a reasonable argument that they might have been a victim of trafficking is entitled to at least 45 days to \"recover and reflect\" - with a final decision on their case maybe a year down the road.</p>\n    <p>If this claimant gets that positive decision, he could be off the removal list for a year on top of that as he waits a final outcome.</p>\n    <p>The political risk for the government is that their own lawyer is now proved right, not least because so many arriving on small boats have travelled through countries like Libya where trafficking and abuse are rife.</p>\n    <p>It is too soon to say conclusively whether Tuesday's interim judgment means that this scheme will get bogged down in repeated legal action like the Conservatives' proposed Rwanda policy, which never got off the ground before being cancelled by Sir Keir Starmer 14 months ago when he entered office.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives, though, see vindication in the development. Their leader, Kemi Badenoch, told LBC that her message for the government was: \"We told you so.\"</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told BBC Breakfast that scheme was not intended as a \"silver bullet\" and this single ruling would \"not stop this really important deal from going ahead\".</p>\n    <p>The deal with France was seen by the previous home secretary, Yvette Cooper, as one of her landmark policy achievements, it is now the job of her successor, Mahmood, to make it work.</p>\n    <p>Mahmood is seen at the government as a punchier communicator - displayed, perhaps, in her opening vow as home secretary to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle illegal immigration.</p>\n    <p>Her colleagues will be hoping she is not having to deploy those communication skills at the end of the week to explain why no-one has been flown to France yet.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance.</p>\n    <p>The Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas.</p>\n    <p>Israel says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's \"last stronghold\" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p>\n    <p>The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that \"the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable\".</p>\n    <p>Residents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault.</p>\n    <p>Saad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: \"The drones didn't leave anything.

They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.</p>\n    <p>Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: \"Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.\"</p>\n    <p>\"Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night.\"</p>\n    <p>Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the \"humanitarian area\" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.</p>\n    <p>Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents, so they returned north.</p>\n    <p>\"Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,\" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. \"But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south.\"</p>\n    <p>The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August.

When pushed on why he had not just tried to pick up the phone or form a relationship, President Lula said: \"I never tried that call because he never wanted to have a conversation.\"</p>\n    <p>Trump has previously said that Lula can \"call him anytime.\" But Lula insisted that members of the Trump Administration \"do not want to talk\".</p>\n    <p>He told the BBC that he had found out about the US tariffs from Brazilian newspapers.</p>\n    <p>Referring to Trump, he said that the US president \"didn't communicate in a civilised manner. He just published them [the tariffs] on his portal - on social media.\"</p>\n    <p>When asked how he would describe his relationship with his US counterpart he simply said: \"There's no relationship.\"</p>\n    <h2>'He's not emperor of the world!'</h2>\n    <p>Lula said that his poor relations with the US leader were the exception, listing how he had built relationships with former US presidents, UK prime ministers, the EU, China, Ukraine, Venezuela and \"all the countries in the world\".</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian president attended the World War Two anniversary celebrations in Russia this year and has not cut ties with President Putin. Asked who he had a better relationship with - Trump or Putin - he defended his ties to the latter, saying they had formed them when they had both been presidents \"in previous times\".</p>\n    <p>\"I don't have a relationship with Trump because when Trump was elected the first time, I wasn't president. His relationship is with Bolsonaro, not Brazil,\" Lula responded.</p>\n    <p>He also said that if he passed Trump at next week's United Nations General assembly he would \"greet him because I am a civilised citizen\", but added that Trump may be \"president of the United States, [but] he's not emperor of the world!\".</p>\n    <p>When approached for comment on Lula's criticism of Trump, a White House spokesperson referred the BBC to the US president's past public comments on Brazil.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6bef/live/eaf52a30-93fd-11f0-88f9-857a462f652e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in a red spotted tie, dark blue suit and light blue shirt, sits in the presidential palace for an interview with the BBC\"/>\n    <p>Lula also spoke about his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted last week.</p>\n    <p>A 4-1 majority of justices on Brazil's Supreme Court found the ex-president guilty of plotting a coup after losing the election to Lula and sentenced him to 27 years in prison.</p>\n    <p>Lula told the BBC that Bolsonaro and his co-conspirators had \"hurt the country, attempted a coup, and plotted my death\".</p>\n    <p>Referring to the appeals Bolsonaro's lawyers said they would lodge, Lula said that he hoped that Bolsonaro would continue \"to present his defence\" but that \"for now he is guilty\".</p>\n    <p>He also criticised Trump for \"inventing untruths\" by claiming Bolsonaro was being persecuted and denouncing what the US leader said was a lack of democracy in Brazil.</p>\n    <p>Lula also told the BBC that if the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot had happened in Brazil rather than in the US, Trump would have been put on trial.</p>\n    <p>In the wide-ranging BBC interview, he also advocated for reform of the United Nations.</p>\n    <p>He criticised the fact that five countries - the permanent members of the UN Security Council - have the power to veto decisions and argued that this tilted the balance in favour of those who won World War Two, excluding nations representing billions of people like Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, as well as African countries.</p>\n    <p>The result, he said, was that the UN didn't \"have the strength to solve conflicts\" and the five permanent members made \"unilateral\" decisions about going to war.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f21b/live/36e48e90-93fe-11f0-88f9-857a462f652e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Vladimir Putin walk through a gold-encrusted palace in Moscow, smiling at one another\"/>\n    <p>He defended his continued alliances with Russia and China – two nations where unfair elections and human rights abuses have been documented – while calling for a more \"democratic\" UN.</p>\n    <p>Pressed on Brazil's continuing purchases of Russian oil while Russia wages war in Ukraine, he said Brazil was one of the first countries to condemn Russia's occupation of Ukraine and that \"Brazil doesn't finance Russia, we buy oil from Russia because we need to buy oil just like China, India, the UK or the US needs to buy oil\".</p>\n    <p>He said that if the UN was \"functioning\" then neither the Ukraine war nor the Gaza war - which he described as \"not a war\" but a \"genocide\" - would have happened.</p>\n    <p>The BBC also asked President Lula about November's COP30 climate summit, when Brazil will host world leaders in the Amazon city of Belém.</p>\n    <p>Domestically, the Brazilian president has faced criticism over his support for exploratory drilling for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.</p>\n    <p>Brazil's state oil company Petrobas and other firms have bought blocks for exploration and are awaiting licenses.</p>\n    <p>His own environment minister, Marina Silva, has strongly opposed the plans and some conservation groups fear it could risk oil spills in waters close to the Amazon.</p>\n    <p>President Lula insisted Brazil was strictly following the law in its research and if there were any oil spills then \"Brazil would be liable and responsible and take care of any problem\".</p>\n    <p>He added that he supported a world without fossil fuels but \"this moment has not come yet\".</p>\n    <p>\"I want to know of any country that is prepared to have an energy transition and capable of giving up fossil fuels,\" he replied. But the issue has proven controversial with left-wing voters.</p>\n    <p>Lula, who is 79, said he had not yet decided if he would run for re-election in the 2026 presidential elections.</p>\n    <p>He said that his health and his party would determine that – as well as whether it was politically opportune and whether he stood a chance of winning.</p>\n    <p>Lula slipped in the polls recently, but received a boost after Trump imposed tariffs on Brazil.</p>\n    <p>He concluded by saying that his legacy included reducing hunger, lowering unemployment, and the incomes of the working classes growing.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3rv981qv4go?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The Bank rate is policymakers' main tool for controlling inflation.</p>\n    <p>In theory, making borrowing more expensive means people have less money to spend, which slows prices rises. However, increasing borrowing costs can also harm the economy.</p>\n    <h2>Closely-watched vote</h2>\n    <p>The decision to cut the Bank rate in August was taken after an unprecedented second vote by the nine members of the MPC.</p>\n    <p>Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank, said the decision to cut interest rates was \"finely balanced\".</p>\n    <p>Analysts expect Thursday's vote to be more clear cut, with no change expected.</p>\n    <p>The relatively high rate of inflation means policymakers are unlikely to risk pushing that higher by cutting the Bank rate.</p>\n    <p>However, they do expect the inflation rate to start to drop soon, which leaves the possibility open of further interest rate cuts.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/686e/live/91cd6260-93b7-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing interest rates in the UK from Jan 2021 to August 2025. At the start of January 2021, rates were at 0.1%.

As a result, the expectation of interest rate rises can push up mortgage rates while the expectation of interest rate cuts can pull mortgage rates down.</p>\n    <p>Mortgage rates have dropped very slightly since the MPC's last meeting in August, but further moves are uncertain, according to Rachel Springall, from the financial information service Moneyfacts.</p>\n    <p>\"Many will be waiting with bated breath for the Budget. This waiting game, alongside forecasts for inflation to remain above target, makes it less likely for the Bank of England to make further rate cuts this year,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>She said that savers had seen a downward trend in returns during the time when the Bank has been lowering the Bank rate.</p>\n    <p>\"The average easy access [savings] rate has fallen further below 3%, so savers must act now and switch their variable rate account if it no longer pays a decent return on their hard-earned cash,\" she said.</p>\n    <h2>Global picture</h2>\n    <p>The government would be keen to see interest rates fall further, to boost growth in the UK economy.</p>\n    <p>The Resolution Foundation think-tank, which which focuses on those on low to middle incomes, said living standards needed to improve after a \"lost\" 20 years of growth.</p>\n    <p>But ministers will be aware of the inflationary risk that remains in the UK, especially as prices are rising slower in countries such as the US, Germany, and France.</p>\n    <p>Thursday's MPC decision will come after the US central bank chose to cut interest rates on Wednesday to a range of 4% to 4.25% for the first time since December.</p>\n    <p>Last Thursday, the European Central Bank chose to hold its interest its at 2%.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge2q7wvyz3o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I will robustly defend the British public's priorities in any court.

I'm me.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm a very independent, strong-minded, effective politician in my own right.\"</p>\n    <p>She said she might have been sacked as Commons leader in Sir Keir's reshuffle for telling the Labour leadership things \"they didn't want to hear\" such as how deeply MPs opposed welfare cuts.</p>\n    <p>If she were elected deputy leader she said she would be a \"conduit\" for the views of members and tell Sir Keir \"when we're getting things wrong\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to the Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, she said she did not want a cabinet job if she succeeded, adding that Sir Keir had been \"really clear\" that David Lammy would be Rayner's replacement as deputy PM.</p>\n    <p>As a \"full-time deputy leader\", she said she would aim to bridge the gap between party members and the leadership.</p>\n    <p>Launching her bid for the deputy leadership, Phillipson urged Labour to remain united to win a second term in government.</p>\n    <p>\"I won't pretend this government hasn't made mistakes – I've been first to admit it\" she told supporters in her Sunderland constituency.</p>\n    <p>\"But we can't afford to look inwards - to go back to bad old days of divided Labour Party and open old wounds.</p>\n    <p>\"If we turn against each other only one person will win – [Reform UK leader] Nigel Farage - but millions more will lose.\"</p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>You can hear the full interview with Lucy Powell on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson </strong>\n      <strong>on BBC Sounds</strong>\n      <strong>.

its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK.</p>\n    <p>\"This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,\" Mr Huang told BBC News.</p>\n    <p>He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but \"what's missing is the AI infrastructure,\" adding: \"We are here to build it.\"</p>\n    <p>AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate.</p>\n    <p>Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of \"building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally.\"</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity.</p>\n    <p>\"It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,\" he told the BBC.</p>\n    <p>\"Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth.\"</p>\n    <p>The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex.</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs \"putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom\".</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s.</p>\n    <p>But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst.</p>\n    <p>Mr Nadella conceded that \"all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles\" and warned that AI should not be \"over-hyped or under-hyped\".</p>\n    <p>He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains \"very high\" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put \"off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid\".</p>\n    <p>He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.</p>\n    <p>The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up \"footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need\".</p>\n    <p>The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20g3dr4n4no\">already announced</a> by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.</p>\n    <h2>Big tech comes to town</h2>\n    <p>Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.</p>\n    <p>The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.</p>\n    <p>Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.</p>\n    <p>The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1ld568v5j4o\">said to be part of trade discussions</a>.</p>\n    <p>But Ms Kendall told the Today programme \"that wasn't part of the partnership\" now agreed.</p>\n    <p>She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e6z590wweo\">major issue for the UK's creative sector</a> - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.</p>\n    <p>Google has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crmek723dz9o\">promised £5bn</a> for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.</p>\n    <p>Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9jyzl4532o\">accompany Trump to a state banquet</a> hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.</p>\n    <h2>AI growth zone in north-east England</h2>\n    <p>The government also said there was \"potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment\" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r01y04kz9o\">AI growth zone</a>\".</p>\n    <p>It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland -

The people getting off the boat are wearing life jackets. \"/>\n    <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.</p>\n    <p>The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the \"one in, one out\" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.</p>\n    <p>In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.</p>\n    <p>Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was \"an interim judgement on one individual\" which would not halt the deal.</p>\n    <p>\"It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,\" Kendall said.</p>\n    <p>She said ministers never claimed the deal would be \"a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems\" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.</p>\n    <p>The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.</p>\n    <p>Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.</p>\n    <p>But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.</p>\n    <p>Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.</p>\n    <p>\"There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.\"</p>\n    <p>The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.</p>\n    <p>But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had \"very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals\".</p>\n    <p>Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.</p>\n    <p>Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be \"quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats\".</p>\n    <p>She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was \"worth it to have due process and a fair system\".</p>\n    <p>\"It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],\" Townley said.</p>\n    <p>She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an \"overarching problem\" with the scheme's design.</p>\n    <p>Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with \"we told you so\".</p>\n    <p>Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for \"some tough laws\" and said \"we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country\".</p>\n    <p>Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as \"one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel\".</p>\n    <p>Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.</p>\n    <p>A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.</p>\n    <p>More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.</p>\n    <p>It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ea8/live/2959ad80-9338-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.png.webp\" alt=\"A line chart showing the cumulative number of people who crossed the English Channel in small boats each year for 2021 to 2025 so far.

As at 8 September the total for 2025 is 30,164 which is the the highest for that point in the year of any of the others.\"/>\n    <p>The \"one in, one out\" scheme was announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron in July.</p>\n    <p>Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim withdrawn or declared inadmissible.</p>\n    <p>For each person returned to France, the UK would accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.</p>\n    <p>No-one has yet been removed under the scheme. The first returns to France had been expected to begin from Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>Over the last fortnight, some migrants being held in immigration removal centres received letters that said they would be put on a scheduled Air France flight departing from Heathrow Airport for Paris at 9am this morning.</p>\n    <p>However, a number of sources told the BBC that some of the potential passengers had been told their departure would be deferred as further representations about their cases were made.</p>\n    <p>Asked by reporters - before the High Court ruling - if the scheme was a \"shambles\", a government spokesperson said \"no\".</p>\n    <p>They added that the government was \"confident in the legal basis for this pilot, we've taken steps to ensure it's compliant with domestic and international law; as with any policy, we're prepared to respond to any legal scrutiny that occurs\".</p>\n    <p>It is likely to reignite the discussion about the role of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been a lightning rod for the political right since before the previous government's failed Rwanda plan.</p>\n    <p>The Conservatives will set our their position on the ECHR at their conference next month, with a wide expectation that they will come down on the side of withdrawing.</p>\n    <p>Sir Keir has said that is not something he is willing to do, so the pressure will be on for his government to show they can make their returns scheme work within it.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dqe2443l1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That was on top of £10bn the company committed to an artificial intelligence datacentre earlier this year.</p>\n    <p>Other announcements include £3.9bn from the investment firm Prologis and £1.5bn from the tech company Palantir. The government said the package would create 7,600 high-quality jobs in sectors including clean energy and life sciences.</p>\n    <p>Starmer said that “with friends like the US” the UK could “help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off”, adding: “These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious and ready to lead.”</p>\n    <p>Downing Street sources said the £150bn of inward investment was higher than the figure for the whole of last year and that the prime minister was feeling “very upbeat” because it exceeded expectations.</p>\n    <p>The announcement followed a separate pledge of billions of pounds of investment from US tech firms, including from Microsoft, which has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/what-is-new-uk-us-tech-deal-ai-supercomputers-investment-economy\">a $30bn (£22bn) spending package</a> – its largest ever outside the US.</p>\n    <p>But the careful choreography was dealt a blow on Wednesday when Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who held one of the most senior roles at Meta until earlier this year, described the US-UK tech deal as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/nick-clegg-multibillion-dollar-transatlantic-tech-agreement-sloppy-seconds-from-silicon-valley\">“sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley”</a>.</p>\n    <p>Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge, Clegg said of the US tech companies: “These companies need those infrastructure resources anyway. They’re building datacentres all over the world.</p>\n    <p>“Maybe they were pushed a bit forward just to meet the timetable with this week’s state visit. But … it’s all one-way traffic.</p>\n    <p>“We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal, which is basically just sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley.”</p>\n    <p>Critics have argued that the tech deal, due to be finalised at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat with Trump on Thursday, does little to support the UK’s homegrown tech industry and have questioned what concessions the government might give US tech companies on regulation and tax.</p>\n    <p>After landing by helicopter in Windsor Castle’s grounds on Wednesday morning, Trump joined the king in a horse-drawn carriage but the procession remained within the royal estate and out of the reach of the public, with security concerns given as an explanation.</p>\n    <p>The president and his wife, Melania, were later hosted by Charles at a lavish state banquet inside Windsor Castle on Wednesday alongside several top business executives including Apple’s Tim Cook, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman.</p>\n    <p>They were served Hampshire watercress panna cotta with parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, followed by Norfolk chicken ballotine and a vanilla ice-cream bombe with Kentish raspberry sorbet interior with lightly poached victoria plums.</p>\n    <p>A whisky sour cocktail garnished with a toasted marshmallow set on a star-shaped biscuit “evoking the warmth of a fireside S’more” was served, although Trump does not drink alcohol.</p>\n    <p>During his speech the king emphasised the importance of protecting the environment, saying the legacy of both nations over the “next 250 years and beyond” was to ensure future generations can experience “natural treasures”.</p>\n    <p>Trump, meanwhile, used his speech to pay a heartfelt tribute to the US’s relationship with the UK, saying the “word ‘special’ does not begin to do it justice”.</p>\n    <p>The US leader also heaped praise on the king, describing his as a “very, very special man”. He went on to say: “We’re joined by history and faith, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny. We’re like two notes in one chord or two verses of the same poem, each beautiful on its own, but really meant to be played together.”</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Among those in attendance was Rupert Murdoch, who sat next to Starmer’s under-fire chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.</p>\n    <p>The visit, which has been marked by protests involving an estimated 5,000 people in London and a much smaller number in Windsor, comes after two bruising weeks for Starmer that saw him lose both his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and his US ambassador, raising questions about his political judgment and ability to lead his party into the next election.</p>\n    <p>At the Stop Trump Coalition protest in London, the musician Billy Bragg performed songs aimed at the US president featuring the lyrics “you fascists are bound to lose”. The president came to Britain because he “wants to feel like a king”, Bragg claimed.</p>\n    <p>The comedian Nish Kumar launched a blow-up ball with the vice-president JD Vance’s face on it into the crowd. “Donald Trump is a lightning rod [for] white supremacist groups and racists around the world,” he said.</p>\n    <p>Every effort was put on to impress Trump in Windsor but a flypast of F-35 jets above Windsor Castle had to be cancelled due to poor weather and at times the president appeared bored.</p>\n    <p>Trump laid a wreath at the late Queen Elizabeth’s tomb inside St George’s Chapel and he was given a tour with his wife that included Henry VIII’s burial vault and a memorial plate in honour of Sir Winston Churchill. “This was a great honour,” the president said.</p>\n    <p>Trump and his wife also joined the king and queen to inspect artefacts pertaining to British-American relations.</p>\n    <p>“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents about US independence. “That’s fascinating,” said Charles as he pointed out another table, detailing the transatlantic cable used for communication between the two countries. Trump agreed: “That’s so amazing.”</p>\n    <p>Members of the royal family joined the US president for lunch in the state dining room along with the new interim ambassador to the US, James Roscoe, and Trump’s entourage.</p>\n    <p>The president and the king chatted amiably throughout the day but Trump appeared to breach an unofficial protocol by twice touching the monarch’s back.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday, YouGov released new <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53001-how-do-britons-feel-about-the-2025-trump-state-visit\">polling</a> that suggested that more than half of Britons think the Trump presidency has been bad for the UK. Fewer than one person in 10 thinks it has been good.</p>\n    <p>Britons were said to be fairly evenly divided between those who think Starmer has been too positive towards Trump (30%) and those who think he has got the balance right (27%), the poll suggests.</p>\n    <p>To mark his second state visit, Starmer will give Trump a bespoke ministerial red box adorned with the presidential seal and title. The first lady will receive a colourful silk scarf based on artwork created by Ukrainian children, in a nod to her work raising awareness of their plight. The Trumps will receive the gifts during their visit to Chequers on Thursday.</p>\n    <p>Two people were arrested in Windsor over public order incidents linked to Trump’s visit, Thames Valley police said.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/keir-starmer-150bn-investment-critics-donald-trump-state-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell responds to a question from the media after the central bank announced an interest rate cut. Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</p>\n<p>US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell responds to a question from the media after the central bank announced an interest rate cut. Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</p>\n<p>The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point today, a move that will reverberate across the economy in the coming months. Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at a closely watched press conference about the Fed’s decision.</p>\n<p>Here’s a summary of what happened this afternoon:</p>\n<p>The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point, the first cut since December 2024. Rates are now at a range of 4% to 4.25%.</p>\n<p>Fed economists also released projections, which point to a majority expecting at least one more rate cut by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>During his press conference, Powell said the rate cut was a move toward “risk management” instead of a testament to the strength of the economy. Economists at the Fed are concerned about a weakening labor market, which could see higher layoffs if worsened.</p>\n<p>But Fed officials are still concerned about inflation. Powell said that prices are likely to continue going up toward the end of the year as companies pass along the price of tariffs to consumers.</p>\n<p>A question remains: Will tariff-related inflation be a one-time price increase, or will it be persistent? Powell said economists at the Fed expect it to be more of a one-time price increase but that the Fed’s just is to make sure it’s not persistent.</p>\n<p>With pressure from the labor market and prices, Powell described it as an “unusual” situation for the Fed to manage. “Our tools can’t do two things at once,” he said.</p>\n<p>Powell also took questions about the recent appointment of Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was confirmed by the Senate on Monday. Powell assured that the Fed’s independence is a priority to the entire committee that sets interest rates. And the Fed’s structure offers protection: For a single member to have outsized influence, they need to “make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy… That’s in the DNA of the institution.”</p>\n<p>Powell responded to a question about comments new Fed governor Stephen Miran made at his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Miran said that the Fed actually has a “third mandate”, which is to “moderate long-term interest rates”.</p>\n<p>The introduction of a third mandate is in opposition to how Powell has framed the Fed’s “dual mandate” – balancing unemployment and price increases.</p>\n<p>“We always think of it as the dual mandate,” Powell said, explaining that moderate interest rates come from stable inflation.</p>\n<p>“As far as I’m concerned, there’s no thought of … incorporating that in a different way,” he said.</p>\n<p>Markets appear to be relatively unresponsiveness to the Fed’s highly anticipated rate cut. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are both slightly down for the day, while the Dow is up.</p>\n<p>It’s a stark contrast to last week, when markets shot up at data that showed wholesale prices falling slightly in August, and consumer inflation being within expectations for the month.</p>\n<p>The overall picture that Powell has painted of the economy in his press conference isn’t necessarily one that’s thriving. Powell said that the economy has left the Fed in an “unusual” situation, and said that the Fed’s rate cut is more about “risk management” rather than an testament to a strong economy. The recent rate cut could cause inflation to rise, but risks of the job market worsening under current rates are higher.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen much more challenging economic times from a policy standpoint, the standpoint of what we’re trying to accomplish, it’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said. “There are no risk-free paths now.”</p>\n<p>Powell suggests only 'really strong arguments' not politics can move Fed board decisions</p>\n<p>Powell was, again, questioned about Stephen Miran’s role as both a new Fed governor and Trump’s chair to the Council of Economic Advisor.</p>\n<p>A reporter asked Powell how the Fed can be nonpolitical if one of its voting members is explicitly connected to politics. Powell emphasized that there are 12 voting members and 19 total participants on the board.</p>\n<p>“The only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive, and the only way to do that in the context in which we work is to make really strong arguments based on the data and one’s understanding of the economy,” Powell said. “That’s really all that matters. … That’s in the DNA of the institution, that’s not going to change.”</p>\n<p>A Politico reporter asked Powell how Americans will be able to tell if the Fed, which has historically been nonpartisan, starts to be partisan.</p>\n<p>“We don’t frame these questions at all or see them in terms of political outcomes. In another part of Washington, everything is seen through the lens of does it help or hurt this political party, this politicians,” Powell said. “That’s the framework. People find it hard to believe that’s not at all the way we think about things at the Fed. We take a longer perspective, we’re trying to serve the American people as best as we can.”</p>\n<p>“I think you would be able to tell. I don’t think we’ll ever get to that place.”</p>\n<p>When asked about Fed governor Lisa Cook’s lawsuit against Donald Trump for her firing (a court reinstated her last week), Powell said: “I see it as a court case that I would see as inappropriate for me to comment on.”</p>\n<p>Powell said that Fed officials are expecting inflation from tariffs to be a one-time price level increase, though “we can’t just assume that, [and] or job is to make sure that’s what happens.”</p>\n<p>“We continue to expect it to move up,” Powell said of prices. “Maybe not as high as we would have expected it to.”</p>\n<p>He added that the case for “persistent inflation” is weaker.</p>\n<p>Which is why the Fed cut rates, what he described as a “neutral” policy, given that inflation isn’t out of control, but the labor market has slowed down.</p>\n<p>But Powell acknowledged that it’s “an unusual situation” – the Fed would most likely want to be more careful with rate cuts because of inflation, but has to be wary of the labor market.</p>\n<p>Powell describes labor market as being in a 'curious balance' as demand is down at same time as worker supply dropped</p>\n<p>Powell is again describing the labor market as being in a “curious balance” – a term that he first used in his Jackson Hole speech last month.</p>\n<p>The labor market is balanced out, meaning that the supply of workers is on par with the demand that employers have for workers, but it’s not necessarily a sign of strength.</p>\n<p>Because of immigration, “the supply of workers is coming down”, Powell noted. “At the same time, demand for workers has come down quite sharply to the point where we see what I’ve called a ‘curious balance’.”</p>\n<p>“Typically, when we say things are in balance that sounds good,” he added. “But in this case, the balance is because both demand and supply have come down sharply, now demand is coming down more sharply because we now see the unemployment rate going up.”</p>\n<p>A reporter asked Jerome Powell about Stephen Miran’s appointment, specifically on the fact that Miran is the first Fed governor to also have a role in the executive branch while also serving on the Fed board. Miran is the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors.</p>\n<p>“The committee remains united in pursuing our dual mandate goals,” Powell said in response. “We’re strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that, I really don’t have anything to share.”</p>\n<p>Powell holds press conference on rate cut decision</p>\n<p>Fed chair Jerome Powell just started his press conference on the Fed’s rate cut decision.</p>\n<p>As outlined in the board’s statement, Powell said that the unemployment rate, while still generally low, has edged up.</p>\n<p>“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” he said.</p>\n<p>Powell pointed to new immigration policy as a major factor in the labor market slowdown.</p>\n<p>“A good part of the slowing likely reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force, due to lower immigration and lower labor force participation,” Powell said. “Even so, labor demand has softened and the recent pace of job creation appears to be running below the breakeven rate needed to hold the unemployment rate constant.”</p>\n<p>The median projection for the unemployment rate, which is currently at 4.3%, sees it rising to 4.5% by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Powells also said higher tariffs have begun to push up some prices in some categories of goods, though the full impact have yet to be seen. Price increases due to tariffs could be a one-time price increase or it could lead to “persistent” inflation.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-jerome-powell-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

But the decision is unlikely to satisfy Trump, who has lambasted the Fed for acting “too late” and called for a far bigger cut.</p>\n    <p>“Job gains have slowed and the downside risks to unemployment have risen,” Fed chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a> said during a closely watched press conference. At the same time, he warned, inflation has picked up.</p>\n    <p>It is “reasonable” to expect Trump’s tariffs will lead to “a one-time shift” in prices, Powell suggested. “But it is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,” he said. “Our obligation is to ensure that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.”</p>\n    <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/trump-lisa-cook-firing-court-declines\">Trump moved to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook</a>, claiming she committed mortgage fraud by listing two properties as her primary resident on mortgage applications.

Republicans quickly moved to replace her with Stephen Miran, the current chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. The Senate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\">confirmed</a> Miran on Monday.</p>\n    <p>Miran was the lone dissenting voice on the rates decision. The Fed said he “preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point at this meeting”.</p>\n    <p>The dilemma for the Fed is that lowering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/interest-rates\">interest rates</a> will make borrowing money cheaper, at the risk of potentially causing prices to rise.</p>\n    <p>Powell first hinted that the central bank was leaning toward a rate cut during his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August. At the time, Powell pointed to uncertainty around immigration and trade policy as significant sources of uncertainty for the economy.</p>\n    <p>The labor market, Powell said, is experiencing a “curious kind of balance” where the supply and demand for workers have slowed. He warned of “downside risks” to the jobs market that could see higher layoffs and unemployment.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Such risks seemed to materialize when federal jobs data for May and June showed the number of jobs added to the economy was revised down by 258,000. Though the labor market picked up slightly in August, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">Trump’s tariffs</a> have caused a slow but steady increase in prices. Inflation in August climbed to 2.9% after dipping down to 2.3% in April. The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-4-2025\">estimates</a> that tariffs will cost households an average of $2,300.</p>\n    <p>What remains unclear to economists is the nature of these tariff-related price increases: will they amount to a one-time price increase, as companies pass on tariff costs to consumers, or will the impact on inflation be more permanent?</p>\n    <p>The biggest concern for economists is the possibility that unemployment and prices continue to rise, which could lead to what economists call “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\">stagflation</a>”.</p>\n    <p>For now, Fed officials believe that the labor market is a bigger concern, though prices are still likely to increase at higher rates. The director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-trade-inflation-tariffs-cbo.html\">told</a> CNBC on Tuesday that tariffs have already made prices increase at a faster pace than was initially anticipated.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/us-federal-reserve-interest-rates-jerome-powell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

COPD, a debilitating, progressive disease which causes irreversible lung damage, increased hospitalisations and can lead to death, affects 391 million people worldwide.</p>\n<p>Fasenra is currently approved as a treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA) in more than 80 countries, including the US, Japan, the EU and china.</p>\n<p>COPD, which remains a leading cause of death worldwide, is a complex, heterogeneous disease and we continue to advance other promising approaches in our pipeline to address the unmet needs of patients.</p>\n<p>With its well-established ability to target and eliminate eosinophils, Fasenra has helped transform treatment of severe asthma, and more recently has demonstrated a significant effect in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome.</p>\n<p>The latter is a rare condition that causes inflammation in small- to medium-size blood vessels.</p>\n<p>The company also reported positive late-stage (phase III) results for a subcutaneous version of its lupus drug Saphnelo, saying the treatment significantly reduced disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to a placebo, and matched the safety seen with the currently approved intravenous version.</p>\n<p>A subcutaneous injection is under the skin and is slower and safer while an intravenous injection is into a vein.</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca’s share price fell earlier and was among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 index, but have since recovered and are now up by 0.3%.</p>\n<p>Ofwat sets 'fit and proper' tests for water company directors</p>\n<p>Jasper Jolly</p>\n<p>Water company directors will have to meet new, higher standards for honesty, experience and financial management or face the sack, according to new rules published by the regulator for England and Wales.</p>\n<p>Ofwat said the privatised water companies will have to assess new hires and existing directors each year to make sure they meet standards for honesty, experience and financial management.</p>\n<p>“Fit and proper” tests are widely used across sensitive British industries, ranging from investment managers and broadcasters to the owners of Premier League football teams.</p>\n<p>The regulator could block appointment of directors with unspent convictions, a history of financial mismanagement (including previous responsibility for a bankrupt company) or misconduct - although it is unclear whether the rules would have helped under-pressure Thames Water to avoid the long-running crisis it faces.</p>\n<p>The changes come on top of rules allowing Ofwat to block bonuses for chief executives or chief financial officers if the company has breached environmental rules.</p>\n<p>Emma Hardy, water minister in the Labour government, said the rules were part of “a new era of accountability in the sector”. She added:</p>\n<p>By ensuring that those at the top of water companies meet the highest standards, we are rebuilding public trust, strengthening accountability, and driving change to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good, as part of our Plan for Change.</p>\n<p>Helen Campbell, executive director, delivery at Ofwat said the regulator “will take action where companies fall short”.</p>\n<p>Temu’s UK operation doubles revenues and pre-tax profits</p>\n<p>The UK operation of the Chinese online marketplace Temu doubled revenues and pre-tax profits last year, as British consumers snapped up products offered by the super-budget retailer.</p>\n<p>Temu UK reported revenues of $63.3m (£46.4m) last year, almost double the $32m in 2023, while pre-tax profits similarly surged from $2m to $3.9m, accounts show.</p>\n<p>However, at an operating level, the company, which files under the name Whaleco UK at Companies House, reported losses widening from $7.9m to $8.7m year-on-year. The company put most of its broadening operating loss down to “exchange losses”.</p>\n<p>Because of Temu’s small pre-tax profit, the company paid just $985,000 in UK corporation tax, up from $517,000 in 2023.</p>\n<p>Bold and ‘brat’: M&amp;S bets on womenswear to revive autumn fortunes</p>\n<p>After a cyber-attack rained on its summer, Marks &amp; Spencer is banking on fashion to brighten its autumn.</p>\n<p>A Prada-esque, crystal-embellished, charcoal V-neck cardigan (£46), a faux leather trenchcoat with a price tag of £90 – £6,810 less than the Burberry version – and a £36 short pleated skirt that offers a wearable take on Charli xcx’s “brat” styling will hit shop floors shortly.</p>\n<p>“We can be bolder because, while we continue to dominate in the over-55s, we’ve got new customers in the 35- to 55-year-old age range,” said Maddy Evans, the brand’s womenswear lead, at a showcase of the new collection in the run-up to London fashion week, which begins on Friday.</p>\n<p>The store is relying on womenswear, which has been ticking upward in sales and credibility for two years, to lead a bounce back after a devastating cyber-attack that affected M&amp;S from April to August and is predicted to have cost the business £300m in profits.</p>\n<p>Evans said the retailer was aiming for two-thirds newness in store.</p>\n<p>That basically means that if a customer walks in to see the new season, two-thirds of it she will never have seen before. The other third is core product – white T-shirts, skinny jeans, black wide-leg trousers, pieces that never go out of stock.</p>\n<p>Manchester United hit £666.5m record revenue but lose £33m amid turmoil</p>\n<p>Manchester United have revealed record revenues of £666.5m for last season but still reported a loss of £33m for the financial year. The club were without Champions League football in 2024-25 and finished 15th in the Premier League but their revenue marginally increased by 0.7%.</p>\n<p>Accounts for the year ending 30 June show United’s operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared with the previous 12 months. Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after the co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw wide-ranging, and often unpopular, changes at a club he claimed in March had “gone one off the rails” as a business. The British billionaire warned United would have gone “bust at Christmas” if they had not taken “really tough decisions”.</p>\n<p>The chief executive, Omar Berrada, said:</p>\n<p>On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.</p>\n<p>To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United … As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.</p>\n<p>Bank of Canada cuts interest rates by quarter point</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-steady-38-in-july-official-figures-federal-reserve-interest-rates-donald-trump-state-visit-business-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Whether it’s a favourite bar, biscuit or indulgent hot drink, feeding a chocolate habit costs more than it used to.</p>\n    <p>The price of the chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 15.4% in the year to August, according to the latest cost of living snapshot.</p>\n    <p>Although other price moves meant overall UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/uk-inflation-remained-at-38-in-august-official-figures-show\">was unchanged at 3.8%</a> last month, chocolate was a big riser. Alongside hikes for beef, butter and coffee, it helped propel food price inflation back over 5% for the first time in 18 months.</p>\n    <p>At £30 a go, the luxury 1kg jars of giant chocolate buttons sold by gifting brand Cocoba were a casualty of a soaring cocoa price, explains the company’s founder Darren Litton.</p>\n    <p>With cocoa prices more than doubling over the past two years as a result of poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast, even something aimed at gift buyers was being priced off the shelf.</p>\n    <p>“We delisted them for a while because we couldn’t even sell them at £40 with the price of everything involved,” Litton says.</p>\n    <p>Cocoa now commands about $7,800 (£5,700) per tonne on international commodities markets from below $3,500 (£2,600) two years ago. The price peaked at more than $12,000 (£8,800) at the end of 2024.</p>\n    <p>The easing price means Cocoba is bringing the jars of giant buttons back for Christmas, but even at £40 Litton says it’s a challenge to make the numbers add up.</p>\n    <p>“The cocoa price is still at a very, very high level but seems to be settling down a bit,” he adds. “We make everything at our factory in Kent. We’ve had to increase prices and invest in equipment to improve efficiency.”</p>\n    <p>Cocoba is a minnow in a market dominated by big names such as Nestlé and Mars but surging ingredient costs have hurt them too. Mondelēz, which owns Cadbury, expects annual profits to fall 10% owing to higher cocoa prices.</p>\n    <p>The squeeze has triggered numerous rounds of shrinkflation, with the Guardian recently revealing that tubs of Quality Street and Celebrations and even some Toblerone bars <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/shrinkflation-bites-as-boxes-of-quality-street-and-celebrations-lose-weight\">have shrunk</a> ahead of Christmas.</p>\n    <p>Not much gets past cash-strapped shoppers, who have also raised eyebrows on discovering a KitKat nine-pack is now an eight-pack, and a multipack of Freddos contains four not five chocolates.</p>\n    <p>Alex Lawrence, a retail expert at data company Circana, says higher ingredient costs are being passed on to the consumer. “If you look at the average price per kg for chocolate confectionery it’s up 27% over the last two years, and 12% in the last year.”</p>\n    <p>Britons spent £5.9bn on chocolate in stores in the year to 9 August. Although that figure was up 10%, they actually physically took home less in their baskets.</p>\n    <p>“The quantity we are buying is down 2% year-on-year,” says Lawrence. “People are definitely pulling back in terms of their consumption.”</p>\n    <p>Shop price data compiled for the Guardian reveals the extent of increases over the past two years, with favourites such as Cadbury Dairy Milk or Galaxy costing about 30% more than in 2023.</p>\n    <p>A 110g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk now costs £1.84 on average, which works out at 42p more than in 2023, according to the price analysts Assosia. The equivalent Galaxy bar has gone up by the same amount to £1.79. The data is based on the average pre-promotion price across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons.</p>\n    <p>The big companies all say the same thing when asked about pack size reductions and price increases. Earlier this month a spokesperson for Mondelēz told the Guardian it continued to experience “significantly higher input costs across our supply chain”, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they had done previously.</p>\n    <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p>\n    <p>On the high street, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/people-are-bored-with-coffee-how-posh-hot-chocolate-is-conquering-the-uk\">upmarket Knoops chain</a> sells posh hot chocolates graded by cocoa percentage, with prices starting at £4 for a drink made with a 28% single-origin Colombian chocolate.</p>\n    <p>“It’s been a wild ride for cocoa prices,” says company founder Jens Knoop. It is not just cocoa, he adds that the chain’s matcha bill increased 53% this month.</p>\n    <p>“While there have been increases in our per kilo chocolate price … we have only passed on a small percentage of that to our customers in their chocolate drinks,” says Knoop.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-23\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>But while you might treat yourself to Knoops’ most expensive brew – a limited edition 68% single-origin Madagascan chocolate costing £7.90 – on a day out, in the supermarket consumers balk at tubs of instant hot chocolate costing north of a fiver.</p>\n    <p>The price of a 220g jar of Options is up 20% over two years at £5.40, according to Assosia, prompting shoppers to take to supermarket websites to complain. “This is a good product,” writes one. “It used to be reasonably priced £3-£4 Now it is £5.40!!!!”</p>\n    <p>In a similar vein, at £4.50 a 500g tub of Cadbury hot chocolate costs a fifth more than it did in 2023.</p>\n    <p>Shoppers also complain that other price changes take the biscuit. At £2.25, a 266g pack of McVitie’s milk chocolate digestives costs 35p more than two years ago. Meanwhile a 130g pack of Fox’s milk chocolatey rounds is now £2.30. The same pack cost £1.87 two years ago.</p>\n    <p>The increases are also notable on supermarket own-label chocolate digestives – which provide a cheaper alternative to the big brands – with a 300g pack now £1.12, up from 85p two years ago.</p>\n    <p>Food and drink inflation could hit 5.7% by the end of year, up from August’s reading of 5.1%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food\">Food</a> and Drink Federation.</p>\n    <p>Karen Betts, the trade body’s chief executive, says rising food prices were previously down to energy and commodity shocks, but now government policies – such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/reeves-defends-40bn-tax-increase-in-autumn-budget-as-businesses-prepare-for-nics-hike\">April’s increase in employers’ national insurance contributions</a> – were a driver.</p>\n    <p>“The costs are such that companies can no longer absorb them and are having to pass at least some of them on to consumers.”</p>\n    <p>Needless to say it’s a difficult environment for small companies such as Temprd, which makes “properly chunky” chocolate bars, in flavours such as lemon and blueberry cheesecake.</p>\n    <p>When Rob Anthony started the Essex company with his brother five years ago he was aware that its premium bars looked expensive compared to “run of the mill” chocolate. “At that time our bars were probably around £3 per 100g. Now they are £4.50.</p>\n    <p>“We had to make two jumps, from £3 to £3.75 and then to £4.50, so two price rises in the last four years,” he says, but is hopeful the worst is over.</p>\n    <p>“There might be a [cocoa] surplus this year, because demand has fallen, and production has been quite good. We’re fairly confident we can survive through from now to next Easter without having to put our prices up.”</p>\n    <p>As the brands sold in supermarkets become more expensive Anthony suggests people are becoming more circumspect.</p>\n    <p>“We haven’t changed the recipe,” he says. “We haven’t <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/22/uk-supermarkets-skimpflation-prices-pack-sizes\">skimpflated</a> our product or changed the size. We just put the price up to cope with price increases. People are willing to spend more less often to buy a luxury product … they feel they’re getting better value for money.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/17/chocolate-inflation-consumers-spend-more-but-get-less-prices-rise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The cost of air fares was the main downward driver, while prices rose for petrol and diesel. The cost of hotel accommodation also fell by less than this time last year.</p>\n    <p>Food price inflation climbed for a fifth consecutive month, up from 4.9% in July to 5.1% in August, with small increases in a range of vegetables, cheese and fish items. The price of chocolate rose by 15.4%, while the cost of beef, butter and coffee also increased sharply.</p>\n    <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/new-headache-for-rachel-reeves-as-obr-downgrades-key-productivity-forecast\">facing intense scrutiny over Labour’s economic management</a> amid widespread speculation about tax increases in her autumn budget, which is expected on 26 November.</p>\n    <p>Business groups said the chancellor’s 2024 autumn budget measures, including the £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a>, would force them to cut jobs and raise prices.</p>\n    <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “With borrowing costs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">hitting a 27-year high</a>, working people and businesses are bracing for even more tax rises to pay for Labour’s mismanagement.”</p>\n    <p>Reeves said the government was taking action to help households. “I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills.”</p>\n    <p>The Bank forecasts inflation is on track to peak at 4%, with the potential to delay further interest rate cuts. Threadneedle Street has cut borrowing costs five times since summer 2024.</p>\n    <p>City economists said there were some signs that inflationary pressures were beginning to abate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> for consumer services, which is closely watched by the Bank, slowed to 4.7% from 5% in July.

UK food manufacturers and retailers said government regulations and taxes were also having an effect.</p>\n    <p>Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, urged the Bank to cut rates to ease pressure on workers, arguing that high borrowing costs would have little impact on price increases due to global challenges.</p>\n    <p>“Keeping interest rates high will not bring down these prices – but instead, rates are adding to the pain for families and businesses,” the TUC boss said.</p>\n    <p>Official figures on Tuesday showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">the jobs market cooled in July</a>, while economic growth remains weak, adding to pressure on the Bank to consider a cut in rates. The ONS will provide updated figures for retail sales and the government finances on Friday. However, analysts said concerns remained over stubborn inflation.</p>\n    <p>Martin Sartorius, the principal economist at the CBI business lobby group, said: “The monetary policy committee [MPC] looks set to keep interest rates unchanged tomorrow and, going forward, the MPC faces a delicate balance between signs of a cooling labour market and the risk of price pressures remaining stubbornly high.”</p>\n    <p>UK inflation is running at the highest rate in the G7, outpacing a 2.9% headline rate in the US.

The world’s two largest economies held talks in Madrid this week to try to reach a potential deal.</p>\n    <p>For a 250g canister of loose leaf Royal Blend tea, which retails to US consumers at $27.85, Fortnum’s has now been forced to charge delivery fees starting at $25.41 owing to the changes to US taxes and duties.</p>\n    <p>The 318-year-old retailer, which holds two royal warrants, was not previously liable for any tariffs on the majority of its deliveries to US customers.</p>\n    <p>US custom agents assess whether a “substantive transformation” has been made to a product to decide whether its country of origin is different from where the product has been sourced.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-8\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>This process can be unclear to retailers, while the scrapping of “de miminis” rules has led to customers being wary of buying Fortnum &amp; Mason’s products, which are popular with expats and international buyers.</p>\n    <p>“A lot of our things are sent as gifts [so] if you’re living in New York and I’m sending a present to you, I want to be sure that you’re not going to be landed with a $200 bill on receipt of your parcel,” said Athron. “It’s all in hand, logistically we’re immaculate, it just means prices will go up for US consumers.”</p>\n    <p>Overseas sales of Fortnum &amp; Mason’s goods, including its famous hampers, were £12.5m in the year to July 2024, accounting for about 5.5% of total revenues.</p>\n    <p>Wider inflationary pressure has led the retailer to raise the UK price of a 250g canister of loose leaf Breakfast Blend tea by almost 40% over the last five years.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trumps-tariffs-have-hurt-tea-exports-to-the-us-says-fortnum-mason-boss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Support for Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has surged, with backing from more than a quarter of voters.</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year Haldane told the Guardian that the Reform leader was the closest Britain had to a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/08/nigel-farage-like-a-tribune-for-working-class-former-bank-of-england-economist-andy-haldane\">tribune for the working class</a>”, as he warned Labour to do more to invest in struggling local areas.</p>\n    <p>Starmer has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/14/britain-far-right-protesters-flag-keir-starmer\">Britain will “never surrender” to far-right protesters</a> who use the English flag as cover for violence and intimidation, after Saturday’s march in central London and a summer of flag demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>Haldane was speaking to the Guardian to mark the launch of a report for Claire Ward, Labour’s directly elected mayor of the East Midlands, which urged the government to hand more power to the region to boost the local economy.</p>\n    <p>Ward said events at the weekend showed many people were “simply fed up with not getting change” a year into a Labour government.</p>\n    <p>“They are fed up with not seeing delivery on the ground, of not having opportunity to access skills, good jobs, and the public services they want to see. And I understand that. It is the reason why government and ourselves in the region have to go and make sure we are delivering as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p>“We have an opportunity to do that at local level in the region and I expect government to lean into it and give us the support to do so. And that will help people.”</p>\n    <p>Setting out 10 recommendations for Derby, Nottingham and the surrounding area, the report found that closing an investment gap between the East Midlands and the rest of the UK could unlock £200bn in economic benefits by 2035.</p>\n    <p>The report from the Inclusive Growth Commission – chaired by Haldane and produced by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">Royal Society for Arts</a> thinktank – called for more investment in social connections, skills and transport links.</p>\n    <p>Using an “opportunity escalator” toolkit to analyse the strengths of the local economy, it said the region’s top 18 new industrial sites could boost 30,000 low earners’ wages by £6,700 a year.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said Labour had done “precious little” to invest in skills in its first year in power. In Starmer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/who-will-replace-angela-rayner-the-role-changes-in-labours-reshuffle\">reshuffle earlier this month after the exit of Angela Rayner</a>, the brief of overhauling the skills system was handed to Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary.</p>\n    <p>Haldane said: “We need to think completely afresh about our skills infrastructure, from early years to adulthood, to give people sense of not being afterthoughts, of them not being left out.</p>\n    <p>“Without that people’s sense of dissatisfaction will only continue and possibly even grow. A sense of people progressing in their lives, of being invested in, is the absolute foundation stone of curbing disaffection with the incumbent parties and therefore doing something to turn the tide of populism.”</p>\n    <p>The government was approached for comment.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/17/labour-growth-far-right-economy-andy-haldane\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

We are clear with Israel that this is no way to treat British Parliamentarians.\"</p>\n    <p>The two MPs were crossing into Israel from Jordan on Monday on a three-day visit organised by the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) when they were stopped by Israeli authorities.</p>\n    <p>Opher told the BBC they were held in a passport office before being handed a \"legal form insisting that we leave the country\" and then \"escorted to a bus\" back to Jordan.</p>\n    <p>The Stroud MP said he was told they were not being admitted on \"public order\" grounds and that representations from the Foreign Office to Israeli authorities had been rejected.</p>\n    <p>He said: \"It's very disappointing. We are both doctors and we were really just going to look at healthcare facilities in the West Bank to see if there was anything we could do to support them.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We weren't in any way trying to undermine the Israelis, just trying to see what we could do in the West Bank\" where, he said, they had been told healthcare was getting increasingly difficult.</p>\n    <p>They had also been due to meet the British Consul General in Jerusalem as part of the visit, as well as meeting Palestinian and Israeli human rights organisations.</p>\n    <p>Both Prinsley, who represents Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, and Opher were first elected to Parliament in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Chris Doyle, the Director of CAABU, told the BBC that it had been organising trips for parliamentarians for many years and that recent denials of entry were \"regrettable\".</p>\n    <p>He said it was \"important that British politicians get to see the situation on the ground at a very serious time to determine what's going on.

They told me there's insufficient evidence to prosecute and he's agreed to pay it back,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Another source involved with the business account said they also understood the ex-MP's agreement to repay funds to be part of the reason the police had closed the investigation.</p>\n    <p>Menzies is not thought to have found employment since he stood down as an MP but the Conservative party confirmed they had given him a hardship loan which is understood to be a five-figure sum.</p>\n    <p>He was first elected in 2010. He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.</p>\n    <p>The money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.</p>\n    <p>In December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.</p>\n    <p>He claimed it was \"a matter of life and death\", she has said, with men holding him in a London flat and refusing to release him unless he paid up.</p>\n    <p>The former MP subsequently denied the men in the flat he labelled \"bad people\" were sex workers.</p>\n    <p>A source close to him instead told The Times that he'd met a man on an online dating website, subsequently gone to the flat of a second man,<strong> </strong>and then been falsely accused of being sick before facing demands for a large sum to pay for cleaning.</p>\n    <p>However, one of the men present at the flat has admitted they had agreed to have sex with Menzies for payment.</p>\n    <p>The man, who is Brazilian, advertises himself as a \"high-class male escort\" and said he had participated in a \"party\" with Menzies and several other escorts.</p>\n    <p>The gathering lasted from Wednesday night to Friday morning, with Menzies absent from a full day of parliamentary work.</p>\n    <p>At its conclusion, Menzies didn't have sufficient funds to pay his bill, which amounted to more than £14,000, according to an account he later gave a close aide.</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian man denied that Menzies had ever been locked in but said there were \"lots of other guys\" and the then-MP \"hadn't paid anyone\".</p>\n    <p>He said he was not aware that Menzies was a politician and when informed of this added that he was \"surprised [b]ut that's his problem, I have nothing to do with it\".</p>\n    <p>\"My contact with him was just for work and ended there,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>As well as telephoning Ms Fieldhouse to demand money from the campaign funds account, Menzies summoned a male aide in his 30s to travel from Manchester to London to meet him at the flat where the \"party\" had taken place.</p>\n    <p>The aide said he was also asked for money, and he and a family member ended up handing over around £1,500.</p>\n    <p>Menzies received a further £6,500 from his office manager. She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.</p>\n    <p>After meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.</p>\n    <p>The aide said that Menzies's office manager gave him £1,000 from the money she had been reimbursed from the local business group's account, but he was still owed £500 which the MP told him he couldn't afford to pay.</p>\n    <p>He alleged that Menzies instead told him he would arrange for a bonus payment to be made through his parliamentary staffing budget.</p>\n    <p>Ipsa, which investigated this claim as an allegation of fraud, found that Menzies had signed off a bonus payment for the aide \"a few days after the incident in question\". This was the only time the aide received a bonus and was described as being for work he had done on a wind farm application.</p>\n    <p>The bonus was for £700, amounting to around £500 after tax.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/w59ykwiqehvh/3YnHUeKx52oK5dWRUMHMqO/e318efae337c17e4a3abb339f7a10826/Closure_report_MM.pdf\">In a report on its investigation published on Tuesday</a>, Ipsa's compliance officer said that he had found the case \"not proven\".</p>\n    <p>He wrote that there was \"evidence of wrongdoing\", including the timing of the payment, but stated that the aide was \"non-committal\" in his statement to the police on whether it was for wind farm work or to reimburse him, and that there was a discrepancy over the amount because he'd claimed to be owed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>Another of Menzies's former staffers also told Ipsa the payment was legitimately for the aide's wind farm work.</p>\n    <p>The aide told the BBC that he had done work on a wind farm, but that was just the excuse Menzies used for the bonus which he told him was actually to reimburse him for the money he had lent him to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They are both smiling.\"/>\n    <p>More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on<strong> </strong>the government's approach to tackling addiction.</p>\n    <p>Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.</p>\n    <p>The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to correct data and it is understood ministers are now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.</p>\n    <p>A former senior civil servant said fewer people might have died if drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.</p>\n    <p>Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.</p>\n    <p>The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.</p>\n    <p>Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.</p>\n    <p>Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.</p>\n    <p>The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.</p>\n    <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the most senior civil servant at the Home Office between 2017 and 2020, told the BBC it was \"quite possible\" that fewer people would have died, if the government's drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It really does matter, first of all the level of attention given to these issues, but then specifically it will affect decisions on how much funding to put into health-related programmes, treatment programmes, or into different bits of the criminal justice system.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.</p>\n    <p>His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

That will take it to £12,534.60 a year, a rise of £561.60 compared with now.</li>\n      <li>The old basic state pension - for those who reached state pension age before April 2016 - is expected to go up to £184.75 a week. That will take it to £9,607 a year, a rise of £431.60 compared with now.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>With inflation forecast to be 4% in September, it is likely Tuesday's average earnings growth figure will be used to set the increase in the state pension<strong> </strong>for the third year in a row.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.</p>\n    <p>The standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying income tax.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027.</p>\n    <p>\"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo\">Linda, a retired hairdresser from Wokingham, told the BBC</a> she was worried her state pension was being pushed towards the tax threshold.</p>\n    <p>\"They're giving it on one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a load of good,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The pensioner said she would struggle to manage on the state pension if she lived on her own.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm lucky that my husband's got a good pension so we have a fairly reasonable lifestyle but if left alone I don't know what would happen to be honest.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head.

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’. This could well lead to an early-Autumn pullback in equity markets ahead of the next Fed meeting.”</p>\n<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire has suffered a blow from ratings agency Fitch overnight.</p>\n<p>Fitch has downgraded INEOS Group to ‘BB-’, with a negative outlook, down from BB. That’s a one-notch fall, to the 13th place on Fitch’s scale of credit worthiness, and still leaves Ineos ranked as ‘non-investment grade’.</p>\n<p>Explaining the decision, Fitch points out that Ineos is increasingly highly leveraged, due to the “weak chemical market” and high spending on a new ethane cracker in the Port of Antwerp.</p>\n<p>Fitch also predicts that Ineos’s revenue to grow by 2% on average in 2025-2029, after growing 9% in 2024.</p>\n<p>A lower credit rating implies a higher risk of default, or debt restructuring, and can result in higher borrowing costs.</p>\n<p>A dried sunflower field in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The Guardian</p>\n<p>Last summer’s extremely hot weather was not great for the European and Ukrainian sunflower crop.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian and European sunflower oil prices have jumped, Bloomberg reports, as forecasters expect low yields in the country and limited production across the continent.</p>\n<p>That’s because the hot, dry summer hampered crop development.</p>\n<p>There are forecasts that Europe could see its worst sunflower harvest in a decade, while harvesting in Ukraine is slow following a drought this year.</p>\n<p>In Ukraine, sunflower yields are expected to fall below the five-year average “largely due to the drought in the south, where most sunflower cultivation takes place,” the European Union’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a report.</p>\n<p>Europe is facing similar challenges, with top producer France expecting output to drop 15% below the five-year average, according to figures from the French agriculture ministry.</p>\n<p>Over in the US, retail sales were stronger than expected last month – which might deter the Federal Reserve from a surprisingly hefty interest rate cut tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Spending at retail and food services sites jumped by 0.6% month-on-month in August, and were 5% higher than in August 2024.</p>\n<p>Economists had expected a smaller rise, of 0.2%.</p>\n<p>It’s an encouraging sign for US economic growth, but could also encourage Fed policymakers to vote for a quarter-point cut to interest rates, rather than a larger, half-point cut.</p>\n<p>U.S. retail sales stronger than expected. Hindrance for a 50 bp cut tomorrow? #retail</p>\n<p>Spending at “nonstore retailers” (ie, internet shopping) were up 10.1% year-on-year, while spending at food service and drinking places rose 6.5% compared with a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Britain’ Competition and Markets Authority has launched a merger inquiry into payments provider Global Payments’ $24.25bn acquisition of rival Worldpay.</p>\n<p>The CMA will examine whether the deal, announed in April, could lessen competition in UK markets.</p>\n<p>The CMA has set a deadline of November 11 to reach its Phase 1 decision.</p>\n<p>It’s a year since former Italian PM Mario Draghi’s landmark report, which warned that the EU risked “agonising decline” without an €800bn investment boost.</p>\n<p>Today, Draghi has warned that Europe was “in a harder place” than one year ago, and suggested that Europe actually needs annual investments of nearly €1,200bn, up from €800bn last year, with increasing demand for defence.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/16/uk-wage-growth-slows-jobs-market-cools-business-live-news-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <h2>What is the triple lock?</h2>\n    <p>The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">2.5%.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How many people get the state pension?</h2>\n    <p>There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.</p>\n    <p>People born after those dates claim the new state pension.</p>\n    <p>The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.</p>\n    <h2>What is the rise from next April?</h2>\n    <p>It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.</p>\n    <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">annual growth in earnings was 4.7%</a> for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.</p>\n    <p>The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">It was 3.8% in July</a> and is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.</p>\n    <p>The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.</p>\n    <h2>Is the triple lock popular?</h2>\n    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.</p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/uk-public-finances-obr-national-debt-gdp\">cost about three times more than initially expected</a> and suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.</p>\n    <p>Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.</p>\n    <p>Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.</p>\n    <h2>Could the triple lock be ditched?</h2>\n    <p>The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.</p>\n    <p>The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.</p>\n    <p>“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”</p>\n    <p>He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.</p>\n    <p>Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.</p>\n    <p>“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.</p>\n    <p>“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Half of the increase is driven by the triple lock, at a time of rising pressure on other areas of spending and social care.</p>\n    <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called for the policy to be scrapped. Heidi Karjalainen, a senior research economist at the thinktank, said: “The triple lock has so far been much costlier than initially expected, and it creates a lot of uncertainty in terms of future spending.</p>\n    <p>“If the economy is doing well then it won’t cost more than increasing the state pension in line with average earnings growth, whereas in volatile periods it can become very costly – as we have seen in the last decade and a half.”</p>\n    <p>It comes as official figures showed the UK’s jobs market has continued to cool, amid a slowdown in annual pay growth and rising redundancies.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said annual growth in regular earnings excluding bonuses slowed to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the three months to June, matching the forecasts of City economists.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The official unemployment rate was unchanged on the previous month in July, at 4.7%, the highest level in four years.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have complained since Reeves’s first autumn budget that her £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a> and 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” would force them to cut jobs and raise prices for consumers.</p>\n    <p>Economists said there was clear evidence of the jobs market cooling. Separate figures from HMRC showed a decline in the number of workers on company payrolls of 8,000, matching City forecasts.</p>\n    <p>After taking account of inflation, annual growth in regular pay was 1.2% in the three months to July, down from 1.5%.</p>\n    <p>Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Senate Republicans voted on Monday to confirm a senior Trump official to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors as the White House raced to strengthen the US president’s control over the central bank ahead of its latest meeting.</p>\n    <p>Hours before Fed policymakers convene for their September decision on interest rates, the Senate voted 48 to 47 to confirm Stephen Miran – already chair of Donald Trump’s council of economic advisers – as a governor.</p>\n    <p>The vote concluded just as a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/appeals-court-declines-let-trump-remove-fed-governor-cook-2025-09-16/\">US appeals court</a> declined the Trump administration’s request to fire Lisa Cook, a governor appointed by Joe Biden, before the two-day policy meeting begins on Tuesday. The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”</p>\n    <p>The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/stephen-miran-federal-reserve-lisa-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-25\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p>\n    <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p>\n    <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p>\n    <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p>\n    <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p>\n    <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p>\n    <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p>\n    <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p>\n    <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p>\n    <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p>\n    <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p>\n    <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s ailing property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.</p>\n    <p>China’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports which have been dealt a blow by the trade war with the US. Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a slump in US-bound exports last month. China’s exports to the US fell by 33.12% year on year in August, according to customs data. Overall exports increased by 4.4% in August.</p>\n    <p>“The activity data point to a further loss of momentum,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a>, wrote in a note. “While some of this reflects temporary weather-related disruptions, underlying growth is clearly sliding, raising pressure on policymakers to step in with additional support.”</p>\n    <p>Factory activity was hit by the hottest conditions since 1961 and the longest rainy season for the same period.</p>\n    <p>Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to offset <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/trump-asks-eu-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-india-and-china-to-put-pressure-on-russia\">Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies</a> and weak consumer spending.</p>\n    <p>Separate data this month showed factory owners have had some success diverting US-bound shipments to south-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, but the drag from the property crisis continues.</p>\n    <p>Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING, suggested the weak data indicated “further stimulus support could be needed to ensure a strong finish to the year”.</p>\n    <p>She said: “While it is too early to gauge the impact of the consumer loan subsidies coming into effect in September, it is likely that more policy support is still needed, given the broader slowdown across the board.” Song said there was a “high possibility” of further interest rate cuts in coming weeks.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>However, Zhaopeng Xing, a senior China strategist at ANZ, said that while the data showed momentum in the world’s second-largest economy was weakening, it was not yet bad enough to trigger a new round of stimulus.</p>\n    <p>“Policies and measures to support service consumption are expected to offset the impact of aggregate demand this month,” he said, adding that an official crackdown on firms aggressively cutting prices made domestic demand appear worse than it was.</p>\n    <p>Chinese households, which have seen their wealth shrink in the property downturn, have tightened their purse strings as business confidence falters, dampening the jobs market.</p>\n    <p>Unemployment edged up to a six-month high of 5.3% in August, from 5.2% a month prior and 5% in June.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, new home prices fell by 0.3% last month from July and by 2.5% on an annual basis, a different NBS dataset showed.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</i>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/chinese-economy-weakens-as-consumer-spending-and-factory-output-slows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p>\n    <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p>\n    <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p>\n    <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p>\n    <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p>\n    <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p>\n    <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p>\n    <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p>\n    <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p>\n    <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/aldis-uk-boss-warns-shoppers-face-higher-food-prices-if-budget-heaps-extra-costs-on-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p>\n    <p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p>\n    <p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants. It would supply the DP World’s London Gateway port and business park.</p>\n    <p>The government said more nuclear facilities were needed for clean homegrown power to ensure energy security, with the commercial deals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">Starmer’s announcement this year</a> of the biggest expansion of nuclear power in generations, and the eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment\">go-ahead for the new Sizewell C</a> station in Suffolk with billions in state funding.</p>\n    <p>Ministers also hope to attract major US tech investment in AI datacentres with the promise of abundant electricity to meet their huge power requirements.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The US secretary of energy, Chris Wright, said the US was looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution”. He said: “Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”</p>\n    <p>The deals, he added, would “unleash commercial access in both the US and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening US energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”</p>\n    <p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the transatlantic deals would contribute to the sector’s “industrial revival, creating thousands of high-value jobs, and strengthening the UK’s energy security”.</p>\n    <p>As well as attempting to reduce broader reliance on overseas energy, the UK-US agreement – known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy – will look to eliminate any remaining dependency on Russian nuclear material by the end of 2028.</p>\n    <p>The deal will mean both countries fast-track reactor design checks by collaborating and accepting regulatory assessments from the other, avoiding duplicating bureaucracy. The government said this streamlined approach would help British exports, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup\">Rolls-Royce</a> in the process of getting its small modular reactor design approved in the US.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/uk-and-us-line-up-string-of-deals-to-build-modular-nuclear-reactors-in-britain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
