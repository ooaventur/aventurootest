the strongest and most extended moves in Elliott Wave theory.</p><p>The projection lines show potential targets, with the most conservative target around $0.051 representing approximately 31% upside from current levels, while the more aggressive projection extends toward $0.058, offering roughly 49% potential gains.</p><p>This bullish outlook gains additional support from the formation of a well-defined bullish pennant pattern that emerged following the July peak at $0.046.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure><p>The pennant structure typically signals continuation of the prior uptrend, and the measured move from this formation projects a target toward the $0.065 level, representing approximately 67% upside potential from current levels.</p><p>The wave relationship and Fibonacci extensions support these higher targets, particularly given that third waves often extend 1.618 times the length of the first wave, while the pennant breakout would provide additional confirmation of the bullish trajectory.</p>\n

Retail users often only gain exposure once tokens begin trading openly, long after early backers and insiders have secured allocations. </p><p>Kraken Launch is intended to change that dynamic by offering a model it describes as “IPO-style” token sales, ensuring greater transparency, equal access, and regulatory clarity.</p><p>The product arrives as Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework begins to take effect, with Kraken emphasizing that all sales conducted through the platform will adhere to clear regulatory requirements. </p><p>According to the company, participants will have access to all necessary information, free from hidden allocations or insider deals, while enjoying the security and compliance infrastructure of the Kraken exchange.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>“Kraken is building the foundation of tomorrow’s financial infrastructure with crypto at its core,” said Brett McLain, the exchange’s Head of Payments and Blockchain. </p><p>He added that the partnership with Legion would help democratize token sales by aligning communities with project builders, setting what he called a “higher standard” for the next generation of fundraising.</p><p>Legion, which has built a reputation for its compliance-focused fundraising technology, will serve as the backbone of the initiative. </p><p>Its system evaluates participants based on on-chain history, social activity, and developer contributions, ensuring that a portion of token allocations go to those who have meaningfully contributed to the ecosystem. </p><p>The rest of the sales will be open on a first-come, first-served basis, both on Kraken Launch and Legion. Matt O’Connor, co-founder of Legion, framed the partnership as a step toward transforming capital markets.</p><p>“The next Figma or Reddit won’t IPO. It’ll launch to its community on-chain,” he said.</p><p>The announcement comes as Kraken continues to report strong financial performance despite market volatility.</p><p>In its Q1 2025 update, the exchange <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/press-releases/kraken-q1-financial-report-ninjatrader-acquisition/\">disclosed $472 million in revenue and $187 million in adjusted EBITDA</a>, a 19% year-on-year increase in revenue and a 1% rise in EBITDA. </p><p>Trading volumes grew 29% compared with the previous year, while funded accounts increased by 26%.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-revenue-rises-to-411-6-million-in-q2-up-18-from-last-year/\">Kraken’s second-quarter figures showed</a> a similar trend. Revenue climbed 18% year-on-year to $411.6 million, though adjusted EBITDA fell 7% to $79.7 million as weaker volumes followed a strong first quarter. </p><p>Total exchange volume reached $186.8 billion, up 19% year-on-year but down 11% from Q1. Assets on the platform rose sharply, increasing 47% over the year to $43.2 billion by June. </p><p>The launch of Kraken’s new product also comes amid reports that the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-to-raise-500m-in-funding-at-a-15b-valuation/\">company is preparing to raise $500 million at a $15 billion valuation</a> ahead of a long-anticipated initial public offering scheduled for early 2026. </p><p>Co-CEO Arjun Sethi has said the raise could help solidify investor confidence before the listing.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-kraken-launches-tokenized-stock-trading-for-european-investors\">Kraken Launches Tokenized Stock Trading for European Investors</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Crypto exchange Kraken has introduced xStocks, a tokenized securities trading product aimed at giving European investors access to leading U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). </p><p>The service, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-introduces-tokenized-securities-trading-in-europe/\">launched on September 10 through Kraken’s PEDSL-CY entity</a>, is restricted to EU clients who pass an appropriateness test or qualify as professional investors. U.S. residents are excluded, as xStocks are not registered under the Securities Act.</p><p>Launched in May, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-debuts-50-tokenized-u-s-stocks-for-24-7-trading-americans-excluded/\">xStocks operate as tokenized certificates </a>that mirror the market price of real-world securities, issued on-chain as SPL or BNB tokens. Each is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset and issued by Jersey-based Backed Assets (JE) Limited.</p><p>Holders gain exposure to price movements but do not receive shareholder rights such as voting or dividends. At launch, Kraken listed 60 assets, including Tesla, Apple, and GameStop.</p><p>The move follows increasing regulatory scrutiny of tokenized equities. In August, <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-meets-sec-crypto-task-force-to-discuss-asset-tokenization/\">representatives from Kraken met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> to discuss tokenized trading frameworks, disclosure standards, and investor protections. </p><p>Regulators worldwide have warned that tokenized stocks often lack the safeguards present in traditional equity markets, despite their 24/7 availability.</p><p>Kraken has also been expanding its tokenization partnerships. In July, i<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-and-backed-expand-xstocks-access-through-bnb-chain/\">t teamed up with Backed Finance and BNB Chain </a>to extend xStocks as BEP-20 tokens, enabling broader access within decentralized finance.</p><p>The rollout shows Kraken’s strategy to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. By bringing equities on-chain, the exchange is positioning tokenized securities as a new frontier in digital asset trading.</p>\n                                                            \n                                \n                                                        <div id=\"tabs-desc-show\" class=\"desc-show-only\">\n                                <p class=\"news-tab\">\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links active\" data-class=\"trending-top\">Trending News</button>\n    <button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-0\">Recommended</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-1\">Popular Crypto Topics</button><button class=\"news-tab-links\" data-class=\"tab-top-2\">Price Predictions</button></p>\n<p class=\"news-tab-line\"></p>\n\n        \n        \n        \n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/kraken-rolls-out-ipo-style-token-sales-in-mica-compliant-launch-on-legion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It achieves this through dedicated RPC endpoints – essentially private data highways that connect directly to the blockchain – giving it faster visibility into the mempool, where pending transactions appear before reaching public order books. </p><p>By tracking liquidity injections, wallet flows, and new contract deployments in real time, the bot identifies tokens showing breakout potential and executes sub-second swaps directly inside Telegram. This gives retail traders a rare chance to act before the wider market catches on.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>Until recently, most of that trading happened on Raydium, Solana’s primary DEX, which meant Snorter’s reach was limited to a fraction of the opportunities. The latest update – first shared by the team on August 22 – expands support to Pump.fun and PumpSwap, Solana’s busiest launchpads for new meme coins.</p><p>With this integration, <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snor</a><a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/snorter/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">t</a><a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">er</a> can now plug directly into their smart contracts, scanning fresh pools and routing trades instantly. In practice, this widens coverage so retail users can catch plays at the very start of a coin’s lifecycle, when the upside is often greatest.</p><p>The updates also make trading more hands-off for users. Automated trading now runs on smarter infrastructure that watches the market continuously and pulls the trigger when targets are met, with real-time notifications sent the moment trades go through. </p><p>Copy-trading has been upgraded as well, with faster wallet mirroring that lets users reliably follow top traders without missing a move.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6\" target=\"_blank\">https://snortertoken.com/en/updates/6</a></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-snorter-is-fine-tuning-withdrawals-and-copy-trading-to-protect-retail-profits\">Snorter is Fine-Tuning Withdrawals and Copy-Trading to Protect Retail Profits</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>On September 11, the project released new updates that show the team fine-tuning some of <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snorter’s</a> core features. </p><p>Withdrawals are now in testing, with added security checks and fee calculations being refined to ensure smooth transfers of SOL and other tokens to third-party wallets. </p><p>Copy-trading is also undergoing early testing, with the team refining mirror logic to ensure trades from tracked wallets are matched smoothly and accurately. </p><p>At the same time, reliability upgrades are being implemented to strengthen failover systems and improve transaction handling, keeping the bot consistent even under heavy load.</p><p>These refinements matter because they push <a href=\"https://snortertoken.com\" target=\"_blank\">Snorter</a> beyond raw speed and early detection. In crypto – where retail often struggles with failed transactions, unreliable copy-trading, or clunky withdrawal processes – stability and security can make the difference between securing profits and losing them.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-why-traders-see-30x-potential-in-snort\">Why Traders See 30x Potential in SNORT</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Taken together, these updates show that Snorter is progressing from concept to a fully operational system tailored for retail traders. </p><p>They lay the foundation for a bot built to give smaller players the same kind of edge whales have long enjoyed, packaged in a tool that runs accessibly inside Telegram.</p><p>Investor interest in the presale reflects that potential as $4 million could be hit in a matter of hours. Traders see Snorter as a rare chance to back a bot that could soon rival – or even surpass – incumbents like Banana Gun, Maestro, and Trojan.</p><p>And at the center of it all is the SNORT token, which powers the ecosystem by unlocking the lowest fees in the market at just 0.85%, while also serving as the currency for staking rewards, governance, and advanced features that make the bot more effective.</p><p>It’s no surprise then that top crypto news outlets like Cryptonews have already predicted SNORT could deliver a 30x return once it launches.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</p></figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-here-s-how-to-buy-snort\">Here’s How to Buy SNORT</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>To join the presale, head to the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/snorter/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Snorter Bot Token site</a> to secure your SNORT tokens using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.</p><p>For the smoothest transaction, use a WalletConnect-certified non-custodial wallet such as Best Wallet, which is regarded as one of the <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/ext/best-wallet/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">best crypto and Bitcoin wallets</a> in the space. </p><p>Balances from the presale display directly in-app, with claiming made easy.

Staking is about taking on a solemn duty to defend the chain,”</em> Buterin <a href=\"https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1968428048086352285\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>, emphasizing that <em>“friction in quitting is part of the deal.”</em></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ethereum Validator Queue (Source: <a

Tensions Over User Experience</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>The exchange highlighted growing tensions between Ethereum’s technical design priorities and mainstream user expectations for digital asset liquidity.</p><p>Sags criticized the disconnect between wallet messaging that promotes <em>“easy yield”</em> and the reality of unpredictable withdrawal delays that can trap funds when users need them most.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p><em>“What about the average user who is suffering with the delay and needs to pay bills?”</em> Sags questioned, arguing that clearer disclosure about redemption periods would help users make informed decisions.</p><p>Buterin acknowledged these UX concerns, admitting the Ethereum Foundation <em>“needs to be more active at the UX layer”</em> and has been working to address usability issues over recent months.</p><p>The Ethereum founder argued that reducing exit delays would make the chain <em>“much less trustworthy from the PoV of any node that does not go online very frequently,”</em> positioning the delays as essential for maintaining network stability.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-queue-dynamics-create-market-tension\">Queue Dynamics Create Market Tension</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>The current validator queue mechanics operate through strict churn limits of 256 validators per epoch, creating bottlenecks when exit demand surges beyond the network’s processing capacity.</p><p>Recent market data shows the exit queue peaked at over 1 million ETH worth approximately $5 billion in late August, before settling to current levels, still requiring 43 days to clear completely.</p><p>Meanwhile, the entry queue containing 432,077 ETH faces just a 7-day wait, creating an asymmetric dynamic that traps more supply than it releases in the short term.</p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Ethereum Queue Wait Time (Source: <a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ValidatorQueue</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>This imbalance has created what analysts describe as artificial supply shortages, with<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/833k-eth-trapped-in-validator-queue-creates-supply-shortage-4500-breakout-next/\"> previous Cryptonews reports</a> highlighting how 833,000 ETH trapped in queues reduced available trading supply.</p><p>The 9.1-day sweep delay adds additional friction to the exit process, meaning validators face multiple layers of waiting even after initiating unstaking requests.</p><p>Exchange flow data reveals these queue dynamics are reducing sell pressure, with Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows hitting<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-inflows-hit-1-year-low-as-crypto-investors-brace-for-fed-decision-btc-eyes-120k/\"> 1-year lows</a> as larger holders avoid moving assets to trading platforms.</p><p>Staking demand has continued growing despite the exit delays, with the queue reaching<a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-staking-queue-hits-3-7b-highest-level-since-2023/\"> $3.7 billion in early September</a>, its highest level since the Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in 2023.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-security-versus-liquidity-trade-offs-spark-broader-debate\">Security Versus Liquidity Trade-offs Spark Broader Debate</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>Notably, the unstaking controversy is a fundamental tension between blockchain security models and modern financial expectations for asset liquidity.</p><p>Buterin’s military analogy reflects Ethereum’s proof-of-stake design philosophy, where validator commitments must be sticky enough to prevent coordinated attacks or mass exodus events that could destabilize consensus.</p><p>Critics argue this creates a dangerous precedent where large holders face material liquidity constraints, potentially amplifying sell pressure when exits do occur or forcing investors toward liquid staking derivatives.</p><p>The debate has sparked discussions about potential protocol modifications, including proposals for faster validator key switching that would allow repositioning without full exits.</p><p>One X user suggested implementing <em>“a faster process to unstake and restake with different clients that’s not adding to the queue”</em> to improve client diversity without compromising security guarantees.</p><p>Buterin responded favorably to a <em>“switch your keys”</em> function where validators would remain vulnerable to slashing from old keys temporarily while continuing to stake, describing it as something that <em>“would only help, and would not hurt any guarantees.”</em></p><p>However, any changes to the current queue system would require broad consensus among Ethereum developers and stakeholders, given the security implications of reducing validator commitment friction.</p>\n

Most analyst price prediction for PI coin have leaned bearish, and the chart hasn’t given much reason to think otherwise. Still, the Pi Core Team is pushing ahead with network upgrades.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://x.com/cryptoleakvn/status/1968487275916050640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">latest Pi Node Docker</a> now includes Stellar Core v23 and Horizon v23, confirming Pi Network has started rolling out its V23 upgrade. This boosts both performance and compliance. Pi’s official account also noted that “Testnet1 blockchain has been upgraded from protocol version 19 to version 22,” calling it the first step toward unlocking new layers of functionality and control.</p><p>This news sparked only a small bounce, with PI coin up about 3% in the past 24 hours and 4% on the week. Encouraging, maybe, but the chart tells a different story. A clear bearish Head-and-Shoulders pattern is forming, and with the network expected to temporarily go offline during the upgrade, price pressure could easily increase, something history has shown again and again in crypto.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-pi-coin-price-prediction-bearish-chart-signals-trouble-ahead\">PI Coin Price Prediction: Bearish Chart Signals Trouble Ahead</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: PIUSD / <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/PIUSDT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TradingView</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>The PI coin chart is throwing a clean head and shoulders, the classic bearish vibe. The right shoulder looks done after that bounce, and the neckline is sitting right at $0.33. If price slips under it, its probably heading for $0.31, which would mark a new all-time low.</p><p>For bulls to fight back, PI needs to reclaim $0.37 with solid volume. Until that happens, every bounce is more like a trap than a rally, setting things up for another leg down.</p><p>Backing this up, the RSI is sitting mid-range around 44, not oversold yet, so there is room for more downside. MACD is flat to leaning bearish too, which lines up perfectly with the breakdown scenario.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-snorter-bot-could-be-solana-s-next-big-thing\">Snorter Bot Could Be Solana’s Next Big Thing</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</p></figure><p>Wall Street has been <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-helius-raises-500m-for-sol-buys-wall-street-just-getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">dropping billions into Solana treasuries</a>, showing how fast new money and narratives can shift markets.

crossed $1,000 for the first time, achieving a new all-time high of $1,005 while pushing its market capitalization near $140 billion. </p><p>The historic milestone prompted former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to declare “<strong><em>To the next 10,000x together</em></strong>” after witnessing the token’s journey from $0.10 ICO price eight years ago.</p><p>Technical analysis reveals BNB completing a five-wave Elliott Wave structure with Fibonacci projections targeting $1,200 as the next major resistance level. </p><p>The breakout coincides with reports of Binance nearing a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice to potentially end court-appointed monitoring requirements from its 2023 settlement.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span

of Justice</a> to eliminate its court-appointed monitor requirement from the $4.3 billion 2023 settlement for anti-money laundering violations. </p><p>Federal prosecutors are discussing ending the three-year oversight obligation that has operated since the compliance agreement.</p><p class=\"dslot row mb-20 \" did=\"5\"></p><p>The Trump administration has already terminated monitors for three companies appointed during the Biden era, including two Glencore units that accumulated $142 million in combined oversight costs. </p><p>Enhanced compliance reporting requirements would replace external monitoring before DOJ approval.</p><p>CZ changed his Twitter bio from “<strong><em>ex-binance</em></strong>” back to “<strong><em>@binance</em></strong>,” sparking speculation about a potential leadership return. </p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: X/@cz_binance</figcaption></figure><p>While no official indication exists regarding his reentry into operations, the crypto community views the narrative as momentum-building for BNB’s continued advance.</p><p>The wider crypto market gained approximately 3% following the Federal Reserve’s anticipated 25 basis point rate cut.</p><p>Notably, a long-term investor’s $1,000 BNB investment from 2017 <a href=\"https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1968620305988923411\" target=\"_blank\">reached</a> over $1 million in value, representing a 1,000-fold return over eight years.</p><p>BNB also reclaimed its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, edging past Solana with its $140 billion valuation. </p><p>The milestone coincides with growing institutional interest as digital asset treasuries (DATs) focus on high-quality assets with proven utility and revenue generation.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-elliott-wave-completion-points-to-1-200-target\">Elliott Wave Completion Points to $1,200 Target</span></h2><span class=\"replacer\"></span><p>BNB’s 4-hour chart displays completion of a five-wave Elliott Wave impulse sequence from July lows around $400. </p><p>According to MoreCryptoOnline analyst, the wave structure shows clear progression through waves 1-5, with the recent explosive move representing completion of wave 5 in a larger degree impulse pattern.</p><figure

around $994. </p><p>The 50% extension projects toward $1,200, representing approximately 20% upside from current levels with a strong technical foundation.</p><p>The golden zone between $764-832 represents deeper retracement levels should a significant correction materialize. </p><p>However, the $918 level serves as immediate support for trend continuation, aligning with the analyst’s noted crucial support threshold.</p><p>Sub-wave markers indicate potential for further subdivision if current consolidation evolves into more complex corrective patterns. </p><p>The overall structure remains bullish for higher degree targets despite potential near-term consolidation following the historic breakout achievement.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span

transaction dominance creates natural buying pressure for BNB tokens required for gas fees and network participation.</p><p>The 7-day moving average shows consistent leadership throughout 2025, with peak transaction counts reaching 16-17 million during high-activity periods. </p><p>To take it even further, the weekly timeframe analysis emphasizes the significance of the $1,000 breakout in the historical context.</p><p>The decisive move above multi-year resistance levels suggests a fundamental shift in market perception rather than a temporary speculation-driven advance.</p><p>Successful retests of previous resistance levels have converted to support, creating a strong foundation for continued advancement. </p><p>The ascending trendline structure since early 2023 shows a consistent uptrend, with the recent breakout representing the acceleration of the established pattern.</p><p>BNB’s next clear trajectory depends on maintaining support above $950-$980 levels while building momentum toward the projected $1,200-$1,300 resistance zone. </p><p>Success at these levels could trigger extended moves toward $1,500, while failure might prompt retracement to the $850-$900 golden pocket before resuming upward momentum.</p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span id=\"h-is-maxi-doge-the-next-1000x-meme-coin-everyone-s-buying\">Is Maxi Doge the Next 1000x Meme Coin Everyone’s

On September 17, Ether products saw $1.89 million in net outflows, extending a streak of withdrawals that has persisted since early September. </p>\n<p>Fidelity’s FETH was the largest loser, with $29.19 million in redemptions. Bitwise’s ETHW also saw $9.67 million exit the fund. </p>\n<p>Inflows at BlackRock’s ETHA, which added $25.86 million, and smaller gains at Grayscale’s products were not enough to offset the broader weakness.</p>\n<p>Total assets under management for Ether ETFs now stand at $29.72 billion, or 5.47% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Cumulative inflows are reported at $13.66 billion. </p>\n<p>The figures follow a period of heavy selling earlier this month, when Ether ETFs lost more than $1 billion over six consecutive sessions, including a <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/alarming-1b-drain-hits-spot-eth-etfs-in-6-day-streak-is-a-deeper-crash-imminent/\">$446.7 million single-day withdrawal on September 9</a>.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have shown stronger resilience.

He wrote:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“From the victim’s perspective, he just clicked a few times to confirm the wallet’s pop-up signature requests, didn’t spend a single penny of gas, and $6.28 million was gone.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>How Permit exploits work</h2>\n    <p>Permit approvals were originally designed to simplify token transfers. Instead of submitting an on-chain approval and paying fees, a user can sign an off-chain message authorizing a spender.</p>\n    <p>That efficiency, however, has created a new attack surface for malicious players.</p>\n    <p>Once a user signs such a permit, attackers can combine two functions—Permit and TransferFrom—to drain assets directly. Because the authorization takes place off-chain, wallet dashboards show no unusual activity until the funds move.</p>\n    <p>As a result, the assets are gone when the approval executes on-chain, and tokens are redirected to the attacker’s wallet.</p>\n    <p>This loophole has made permit exploits increasingly attractive for malicious actors, who can siphon millions without needing complex hacks or high-cost gas wars.</p>\n    <h2>Phishing losses</h2>\n    <p>The latest theft highlights a wider trend of escalating phishing campaigns.</p>\n    <p>Scam Sniffer <a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1964235400593178793\">reported</a> that in August alone, attackers stole $12.17 million from more than 15,200 victims. That figure represented a 72% jump in losses compared with July.</p>\n    <p>According to the firm, the most significant share of August’s damages came from three large accounts that accounted for nearly half of the total. This included one wallet that lost $3.08 million in a single exploit.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the firm attributed the surge in losses to a rise in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-investor-loses-1m-in-uniswap-scam-exploiting-ethereums-eip-7702/\">EIP-7702 batch-signature scams</a> and direct transfers to malicious contracts.</p>\n    <p>Considering this, security experts have urged crypto users to be cautious when interacting with wallet requests and refuse demands that grant unlimited permissions to their wallets.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-whale-loses-6m-to-sneaky-phishing-scheme-targeting-staked-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/sponsored-post-disclaimer\">Learn more ›</a></p>\n    <p><strong>September 18, 2025 – Geneva, Switzerland</strong> – <a href=\"https://trondao.org/\">TRON DAO</a>, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), announced today that PayPal USD will be available on the TRON network through Stargate Hydra as a permissionless token, PYUSD0, leveraging LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard. PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.”</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.”</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains.</p>\n    <p>The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high.</p>\n    <p>This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide.</p>\n    <h2>\n      <strong>\n        <i>About TRON DAO</i>\n      </strong>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <i>About TRON DAO</i>\n    </p>\n    <p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>\n    <p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.”</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://tron.network/\">TRONNetwork</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.org/\"> TRONDAO</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/TRONDAO\">X</a> |<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\"> YouTube</a> |<a href=\"https://t.me/tronnetworkEN\"> Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/trondao\">Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/\"> Reddit</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/tronprotocol\"> GitHub</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.medium.com/\"> Medium</a> |<a href=\"https://forum.trondao.org/\"> Forum</a></p>\n    <p><strong> Media Contact</strong>Yeweon Park</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>\n    </p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/paypal-usd-expands-to-tron-network-via-layerzero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

In that light, frictions such as exit delays serve as safeguards.</p>\n    <p>“An army cannot hold together if any percent of it can suddenly leave at any time,” he wrote, stressing that Ethereum’s reliability depends on ensuring validators cannot abandon their role instantaneously.</p>\n    <p>However, Buterin conceded that the current design is not perfect. Nevertheless, he argued:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“That’s not to say that the current staking queue design is optimal, rather that if you reduce the constants naively then that makes the chain much less trustworthy from the PoV of any node that does not go online very frequently.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Buterin’s remarks echoed the perspective of Sreeram Kannan, founder of restaking protocol <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/eigenlayer/\">EigenLayer</a>.</p>\n    <p>In his own <a href=\"https://x.com/sreeramkannan/status/1968350778697142521?s=46\">post</a> on Sept. 17, Kannan described Ethereum’s prolonged exit period as “a conservative parameter” that acts as a vital security measure.</p>\n    <p>He explained that the wait time protects against worst-case scenarios, such as coordinated validator attacks where participants might attempt to exit before facing slashing penalties.</p>\n    <p>Considering this, Kannan warned:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Unstaking cannot be instantaneous.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>He continued that shortening the process to a matter of days could expose Ethereum to attacks that drain its security assumptions.</p>\n    <p>By contrast, the longer window allows for detecting and punishing malicious behavior such as double-signing. This design ensures that misbehaving validators cannot easily escape accountability.</p>\n    <p>Kannan highlighted that this buffer allows inactive nodes to reconnect and periodically validate the correct fork. He argued that competing forks could each claim to be valid without such a mechanism, leaving offline nodes unable to determine the truth when rejoining.</p>\n    <p>He concluded:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Instead of having a fixed long unstaking period, ethereum engineered its exit queue to be instantaneous if only a small amount of stake withdrew in a given period. But if lot of stake wants to withdraw the queue builds up – worst case to several months.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>This strong defense comes at a time when <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-staking-exit-wait-balloons-to-43-days/\">Ethereum’s exit queue</a> has hit historic highs.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.validatorqueue.com/\">Data</a> from the Ethereum Validators Queue shows that the unstaking backlog now spans 43 days, with over 2.48 million ETH, valued at approximately $11.3 billion, awaiting withdrawal.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/vitalik-buterin-defends-43-day-ethereum-exit-staking-queue-as-11-3b-waits-in-line-what-breaks-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n    <p>The United Kingdom’s minority party Reform has formally rejected the Bank of England’s proposal to cap stablecoin holdings and its broader plan to introduce a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bank-of-england-advances-design-phase-of-digital-pound-cbdc/\">central bank digital currency (CBDC)</a>.</p>\n    <p>In a Sept. 18 <a href=\"https://x.com/ziayusufuk/status/1968575233784160260?s=46\">statement</a> on X, the party’s head of policy, Zia Yusuf, alongside party figurehead Nigel Farage, warned that the measures would damage Britain’s competitiveness in the global digital economy.</p>\n    <p>Last week, the Bank of England proposed restricting stablecoin exposure for individuals and businesses. Under the draft proposal, citizens would be limited to holding between £10,000 and £20,000 in systemic stablecoins, while businesses would face a maximum cap of £10 million.</p>\n    <p>The regulator argues that the plan aims to reduce financial risks as digital assets become more mainstream.</p>\n    <p>However, the Reform party leaders framed the proposal as an attack on innovation rather than a safeguard.</p>\n    <p>They argued that limiting the use of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/insights/stablecoins-could-face-yield-compression-after-feds-rate-cut/\">stablecoins</a> risks choking off demand for British government debt while strengthening the position of global rivals.</p>\n    <p>According to the statement, dollar–pegged stablecoins like <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin/\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/\">USDT</a> funnel significant liquidity into US Treasuries, reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in digital finance. By contrast, the UK lacks any mechanism equivalent to a backstop demand for gilts.</p>\n    <p>Yusuf wrote:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“Now ask yourself: where is the British equivalent? Where is the pound-backed stablecoin with deep liquidity, one that global markets can trust, one that channels fresh demand into UK gilts? It doesn’t exist, because policymakers here have been openly hostile to innovators. Instead of building the future, Britain’s regulators have smothered it.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Considering this, Yusuf argued that “stablecoins are not a danger to financial stability.” Instead, he described the assets as:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>“[A] bridge between the digital world and the traditional banking system. A bridge between entrepreneurs and customers, between investors and opportunity. They are simply new wrappers around money – safer, faster, programmable money that can settle instantly across borders without costly intermediaries.”</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>No to CBDC</h2>\n    <p>The Reform Party has also fought hard against the creation of a digital pound.</p>\n    <p>According to the party, a state-backed CBDC would hand the Bank of England “unprecedented control” over financial activity, stifling competition and discouraging private-sector innovation.</p>\n    <p>Instead, they advocate for regulated, privately issued stablecoins that could drive growth without giving government entities direct control over citizens’ wallets.</p>\n    <p>To support that approach, the party said it would advance its proposed Cryptoassets and Digital Finance Bill to establish a transparent and proportionate regulatory framework.</p>\n    <p>By creating rules that balance consumer protection with market freedom, Reform argues the UK could emerge as a leader in the global stablecoin race and generate new employment opportunities in fintech and digital finance.</p>\n    <p>The stance marks another step in the party’s embrace of crypto. Earlier this year, it became one of the first political groups in the UK to accept donations in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> and other digital assets.</p>\n    <p>\n      <i>[Editor’s Note: Context on UK politics. </i>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <i>Reform holds five parliamentary seats within the current government behind Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Sinn Féin.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n<p>There’s little doubt that Tether has conquered the world with <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether\">USDT</a>. With a market cap of $171 billion, it outpaces <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/stablecoin/\">all other stablecoins combined.</a></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Tether <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-launches-compliant-usat-stablecoin-under-new-leadership/\">introduced</a> a new U.S. dollar stablecoin, USA₮, to compete with <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin\">USDC</a> in the domestic market under U.S. law.</p>\n<p>The company named Bo Hines to lead its U.S. unit and build issuance and custody around Anchorage Digital and Cantor Fitzgerald, a move disclosed after Congress enacted a federal framework for fiat-referenced tokens.</p>\n<p>USA₮, or USAT, is designed to meet the new regime’s reserve and disclosure requirements. The legislative backdrop arrived on July 18 when the GENIUS Act was <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trump-signs-genius-act-into-law-activating-americas-first-regulatory-framework-for-stablecoins/\">signed</a>, setting monthly reserve attestations, high-quality liquid asset backing, and clear supervisory lanes for both bank and qualified non-bank issuers.</p>\n<p>The competitive field tightened further after Circle completed an initial public offering that raised about <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/circle-raises-1-05-billion-230325081.html\">$1.05 billion</a>, with shares priced at $31.</p>\n<h2>The near-term contest now centers on onshore distribution and reserve income</h2>\n<p>U.S. merchants and payment processors want tokens that fit cleanly within money-movement and treasury policies. This means monthly reserve certifications, bankruptcy-remote structures, and straightforward redemption mechanics.</p>\n<p>The GENIUS Act bans issuer-paid yield, which puts the commercial model on a float scale and operating efficiency.</p>\n<p>Circle’s structure routes most reserves into BlackRock’s Circle Reserve Fund, a money-market-style vehicle invested in short-dated Treasuries and repurchase agreements, while Tether has reported a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-reports-5-7-billion-profit-amid-record-127-billion-us-treasury-investments/\">large U.S. Treasury footprint</a> that has grown with stablecoin demand.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin transfer <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/stablecoin-volume-outpaced-mastercard-paypal-in-2022-as-digital-payments-wars-loom/\">volumes</a> reached multi-trillion levels this year, reminding treasurers that liquidity and chain coverage now matter as much as brand.</p>\n<p>Policy harmonization outside the U.S. will shape merchant access. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority closed its consultation on issuance and custody in July, with the Bank of England considering caps on systemic holdings. Per the FCA consultation <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-14-stablecoin-issuance-cryptoasset-custody\">CP25/14</a>, authorization, safeguarding, and disclosure are set to tighten in parallel with central bank oversight.</p>\n<p>Hong Kong’s licensing regime took effect on August 1 under the HKMA, and Singapore’s MAS framework for single-currency stablecoins already prescribes reserve composition, capital, and five-day par redemptions.</p>\n<p>A U.S. coin that fits GENIUS rules, a UK coin that meets FCA and BoE requirements, and an MAS-labeled instrument create a pathway for issuers to distribute across major financial hubs without bespoke workarounds.</p>\n<h2>Payments rails will be the practical governor of share capture through 2027</h2>\n<p>Visa has expanded stablecoin settlement to additional networks and to EURC, a step that helps issuers reach acquirers and cross-border payouts with less friction. PayPal extended PYUSD to Arbitrum and outlined Stellar plans, which shows how processors can pull settlement off congested chains when throughput and fees matter for merchant experience.</p>\n<p>Distribution through wallets, acquirers, and card networks puts a premium on integration speed, reporting, fraud tooling, and fiat off-ramps, not only on the unit economics of reserve yields.</p>\n<p>Monthly volumes in USDT and USDC already rival major electronic payment corridors, so small checkout routing or payment settlement improvements can shift token preference in merchant flows.</p>\n<p>The onshore float that fits the U.S. framework will set the scoreboard for the next two years, and the numbers drive clear ranges.</p>\n<p>A base case assumes $400 billion of U.S. onshore stablecoins by late 2026 and $650 billion by late 2027.</p>\n<p>In that path, USDC holds 60 to 65 percent of the onshore pool as a public issuer with established bank and fintech integrations, while USAT reaches 20 to 25 percent as U.S. listings, custody, and settlement partners come online.</p>\n<p>An upside path for Tether lifts the onshore pool to $450 billion by 2026 and $750 billion by 2027, with USAT rising to 30 to 35 percent if Anchorage and Cantor-linked plumbing accelerates adoption in U.S. venues.</p>\n<p>A more conservative path for Tether and faster bank adoption of USDC will push USDC to a 70 to 75% share of a smaller $550 billion pool by 2027.</p>\n<p>These are merchant and policy outcomes, not marketing narratives, and the driver is partner coverage across issuers, acquirers, and custodians.</p>\n<h2>Reserves tell the macro story that sits underneath market share</h2>\n<p>If U.S. onshore stablecoins reach one trillion dollars of float by 2027, the implied Treasury bill bid ranges from $600 billion to $900 billion, depending on whether issuers run 60 to 90 percent in bills.</p>\n<p>The composition matters because front-end yields respond to large, persistent buyers. According to the Bank for International Settlements, strong net inflows to stablecoins have been associated with a modest fall in three-month bill yields over short windows, while outflows show larger adverse effects.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has warned that an asset shift into bills can lower credit supply elsewhere, which introduces questions for bank funding models if stablecoins absorb deposits at scale.</p>\n<p>The U.S. law reframes how merchants and banks treat tokenized dollars. Monthly reserve disclosures and asset quality rules move these instruments near regulated cash equivalents in many treasurer policies, even as the law bans issuer yield.</p>\n<p>That policy architecture favors issuers that already speak the language of attestation and custody segregation. It also gives U.S. banks and broker-dealers a clearer footing for custody and settlement services, which matters for U.S. exchanges, money transmitters, and fintech lenders that handle customer funds.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/after-usdts-global-victory-circles-usdc-battles-tethers-usat-in-650b-usa-showdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin price</a> trades near $117,000 after the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates, as the 1,065-day post-halving window approaches.</p>\n<p>The Fed cut rates by 25bps yesterday, placing Bitcoin’s near-term path at the intersection of policy and a cycle marker <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/16/bitcoin-price-pattern-halving\">Axios</a> says has historically captured a “final high” roughly 1,065 days after a prior cycle low.</p>\n<p>The test window runs through late September and early October, then the market will trade into Thanksgiving on flow, dollar, and rate dynamics that can either extend the advance or start the topping process that prior cycles paired with drawdowns of 40 to 60 percent, according to Axios.</p>\n<p>Spot ETF demand is the first lever to watch because it turns the cycle into a flow problem. According to CoinShares’ <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-etfs-attract-2-9-billion-in-fresh-capital/\">latest weekly fund-flow update,</a> U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw renewed net inflows in late August and early September, measured in billions of dollars, while SoSoValue tracked a mid-September multi-session inflow streak with a single-day print of around $260 million on September 15.</p>\n<p>Those figures contrast with the post-halving issuance of about 452 Bitcoin per day, calculated as 3.125 Bitcoin per block times roughly 144 blocks per day. When multi-day ETF demand absorbs several thousand Bitcoin per week, the market’s ability to distribute inventory at the highs narrows, and topping processes can lengthen into a plateau rather than a single peak.</p>\n<h2>Macro conditions set the second lever.</h2>\n<p>This month, the euro touched a four-year high against the dollar as cut expectations increased, while front-end Treasury yields eased into the meeting.</p>\n<p>A softer dollar lowers global financial conditions and often correlates with higher beta across risk assets. At the same time, domestic inflation has cooled from last year’s pace, with August headline CPI at 2.5 percent year over year and core at 3.0 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>The policy outcome will shape whether those tailwinds persist or fade. Throughout the rest of 2025, cuts with dovish language that emphasizes progress on inflation and downplays the need for quick reversals would support the dollar’s drift lower and extend the risk window.</p>\n<p>Cuts that emphasizes vigilance on inflation and a limited runway for further easing would keep rates sticky and reduce the impulse. A no-cut outcome was a low-probability branch, yet it would have tightened financial conditions into quarter-end and left ETF demand to carry more of the load.</p>\n<p>Mining economics frame how deeply price moves are transmitted to the supply side. Hashrate has hovered around 1.0 to 1.12 zettahash per second in recent weeks, with network difficulty near a record around 136 trillion, according to Hashrate Index tracking.</p>\n<p>That backdrop keeps <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-hashrate-at-record-margins-pinched-will-miners-sell-or-pivot-amid-ai-power-land%e2%80%91grab/\">hashprice</a> near 53 to 55 dollars per petahash per day, levels broadly consistent with Luxor’s spot readings this month. Because hashprice scales roughly with Bitcoin price and inversely with hashrate, bands for Q4 can be approximated by combining price paths with modest hashrate creep as new rigs energize. Fees remain a smaller component in the current lull, so price carries most of the signal into miner cash flow.</p>\n<p>A simple baseline clarifies the inputs that feed scenario bands through Thanksgiving, November 27.</p>\n<p>With those inputs, the grid below lays out price and miner hashprice ranges into late November across policy tone and ETF flow states. These are bands, not point targets, designed to reflect how cut tone and net flows propagate into price and miner revenue under low-fee conditions and modest hashrate growth.</p>\n<h2>The placement of the cycle clock matters for how those bands are interpreted</h2>\n<p>Axios frames prior “final highs” occurring near the 1,065-day mark, then transitioning to drawdowns that were less severe in the ETF era than in earlier cycles. That adds a second read-through for investors watching the tape into early October.</p>\n<p>My own analysis flagged Nov. 1 as a potential date for the cycle peak based on previous cycle peaks extending from the last halving by roughly 100 days.</p>\n<p>However, if the window delivers a high and ETF demand remains strong, the outcome can be a rounded top with shallower retracements.</p>\n<p>If the window passes without a new high and flows turn mixed, the market can migrate toward the middle cells of the grid where price oscillates under the prior peak while hashprice is constrained by gradual hashrate increases.</p>\n<p>Policy tone will color the flow of data almost immediately. Per Business Insider’s breakdown of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-rate-cut-this-week-fomc-powell-stock-market-outlook-2025-9\">meeting paths</a>, a dovish cut converts to an easier dollar backdrop and a steeper risk appetite curve, which historically pulls incremental demand into equities and crypto, while a hawkish cut narrows that curve and puts more weight on idiosyncratic flows.</p>\n<p>A no-cut outcome would have tested the lower bands in the table since it removes the near-term easing impulse and tends to firm the dollar. The CPI profile reduces the need for restrictive surprises, according to the BLS figures, yet the chair’s emphasis on data dependence can keep rate-path uncertainty in the foreground even if a first cut arrives.</p>\n<p>ETF flow streaks are the cleanest high-frequency metric to monitor against this policy backdrop. CoinShares’ weekly data provide size and regional composition, and SoSoValue’s daily tallies map whether the post-announcement sessions extend or fade the bid.</p>\n<h2>Translating those numbers into supply absorption is straightforward</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-cycle-clock-points-to-a-final-high-by-late-october-will-etfs-rewrite-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Over the last week, the token has risen by 9%, signaling stronger interest from traders.</p><p>On the 12-hour chart, PENGU had broken out above a descending channel that had kept prices moving lower since late July. The breakout was confirmed as $0.032 held as support during the retest. Fibonacci levels suggest next targets around $0.047, $0.064, and $0.076, with extended projections pointing toward $0.096 if <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pengu-primed-for-liftoff-bullish-retest-signals-180-move-ahead/\">momentum continues</a>.

She embodies what Origin Summit is about: visionary IP with global reach, creative integrity, and cultural relevance,” said SY Lee, co-founder and CEO of Story. “We’re beyond excited to have her as part of the event, because K-POP DEMON HUNTERS showcases the full spectrum of what IP can be. It’s a global cultural movement. It drives music charts, sparks fandoms, inspires merchandise, and reshapes how stories move through the world.

PYUSD0 on TRON reflects PayPal and LayerZero’s work to drive greater availability of PYUSD, enabling the stablecoin to reach the markets that demand it and the users who want it through LayerZero’s distribution network.</p><blockquote><p>“Stablecoins are one of the clearest examples of real-world adoption in crypto, driving everything from payments to remittances,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of PYUSD0 on TRON gives both users and institutions greater accessibility, and reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting assets that bring trust, efficiency, and broader access to the digital economy.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The US dollar is the foundation of finance. Stablecoins are the killer app within the crypto ecosystem,” said Bryan Pellegrino, Co-Founder and CEO, LayerZero Labs. With PYUSD0, PayPal USD expands its reach and flexibility to work across today’s networks and tomorrow’s. Launches like this make it obvious that we are at the start of a global financial market that breaks down borders and works around the clock.”</p></blockquote><p>This integration builds on LayerZero’s acquisition of Stargate. Stargate pioneered the Hydra model for extending assets from a hub blockchain to spoke blockchains. With Stargate integrated into LayerZero, the Hydra model is now applied directly to extend PYUSD to TRON and other blockchains. No action will be required by end users and whether someone holds PYUSD or PYUSD0, it is one unified PayPal USD stablecoin: fully fungible and interoperable across blockchains.</p><p>The integration is closely aligned with TRON’s mission to deliver efficient, accessible, and secure settlement infrastructure for users and institutions worldwide. TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure, dedicated to expanding access and inclusion, with a cumulative transfer volume exceeding $21 trillion since its mainnet launch in 2018. TRON currently hosts over 332 million user accounts on the blockchain, with over $28 billion in total value locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Furthermore, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue driven by real-world activity across the network in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high.</p><p>This integration points to a future where established payment systems, advanced interoperability frameworks, and scalable blockchain networks converge to build the next generation of global financial infrastructure. By aligning PayPal’s expertise in digital payments, LayerZero’s cross-chain architecture, and the TRON blockchain’s scale and global reach, the initiative drives the development of financial systems that are secure, transparent, and inclusive for users worldwide</p><p><strong>About TRON DAO</strong></p><p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p><p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $76 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 332 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.”</p><p><a href=\"https://tron.network/\">TRONNetwork</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.org/\"> TRONDAO</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/TRONDAO\">X</a> |<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OPOGRq02iK-0T9sKse_kA\"> YouTube</a> |<a href=\"https://t.me/tronnetworkEN\"> Telegram</a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/trondao\">Discord</a> |<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/\"> Reddit</a> |<a href=\"https://github.com/tronprotocol\"> GitHub</a> |<a href=\"https://trondao.medium.com/\"> Medium</a> |<a href=\"https://forum.trondao.org/\"> Forum</a></p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/paypal-usd-expands-to-tron-network-via-layerzero/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Bitcoin’s current stability near $117,500 is being shaped almost entirely by retail investors, according to Binance’s latest trading data.</p><p>Inflows show that smaller transactions dominate.</p><h2>Retail Traders Dominate BTC</h2><p>In its latest report, CryptoQuant <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb7efd6e8c203d2e216927-Binance-Data-Bitcoin-Steadies-Near-117500-as-Retail-Inflows-Dominate-and-Whales-\">revealed</a> that inflows of 0-0.001 BTC recorded nearly 97,000 BTC, and those in the 0.001-0.01 BTC range amounted to about 719,000 BTC. This breakdown highlighted the retail-driven nature of the market, where numerous small contributions are providing liquidity and balance.</p><p>Despite the relatively modest size of these inflows, their collective weight has been sufficient to keep Bitcoin steady at the current levels. At the same time, the absence of large whale inflows, specifically transactions of 100 BTC or more, is notable. This lack of large-wallet activity indicates that the market is not being swayed by concentrated buying power but instead by broader retail participation.</p><p>On the positive side, such a pattern reduces the immediate risk of a sharp downturn often associated with whale selling, and gives Bitcoin a firmer footing in the short term. However, the dependence on retail activity also highlights a structural fragility since, if enthusiasm among smaller investors wanes or if whales suddenly re-enter with significant inflows, the market could face abrupt volatility.</p><p>For now, the balance between consistent retail inflows and muted whale activity has created a period of relative calm, which has allowed Bitcoin to consolidate near its highs. If this trend continues, the market could gradually build momentum toward testing the $120,000 level.</p><p>Despite this, there is still the looming possibility of whale intervention, which is capable of either accelerating upward momentum or triggering a rapid correction.</p><h2>Supportive Setup</h2><p>The retail flows come in the backdrop of the US Federal Reserve making the first interest rate cut for 2025.</p><p>Kushal Manupati of Binance said the 25 bp cut creates a supportive setup for crypto, which would <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">boost</a> BTC, ETH, and potentially large-cap alts if funding and ETF inflows remain stable.

The asset is now testing the $3.11 mark, which lines up with a descending trendline that has capped price action for months. Analyst DefendDark noted,</p><blockquote><p>Breaking 3.1097?</p><a href=\"\">#XRP</a>on the daily RSI is strong, and the yellow resistance at $3.10 is getting weaker.<p>Believe</p><a href=\"\">#XRPArmy</a>.<a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/q54guxL90z</a><p>— Dark Defender (@DefendDark)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>The daily RSI is pushing higher and remains below the overbought level, showing continued strength. The metric has also crossed above its moving average, which often points to building momentum. The price is also holding above the Ichimoku Cloud on the daily chart, a signal that often appears during trend shifts.</p><h2>Support Holds as Price Climbs</h2><p>XRP retested support near $3.03 on September 15 and bounced, indicating that buyers may have defended the level. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO stated,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">#XRP</a>Upper and Lower Targets :<p>▫️Lower Targets:</p><br/>Retesting and bouncing from $3.03 is still in the cards, but I believe the retest was completed on September 15th.

A close above this area would mark a key step in confirming further strength. From there, the next levels to watch are $3.30 and $3.40. The asset has also <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-set-to-smash-records-as-fed-cut-and-etf-excitement-build/\">broken out</a> of a falling wedge pattern, which tends to support upward movement.</p><h2>Larger Structure Points to Breakout Potential</h2><p>On the monthly chart, XRP continues to form a bullish flag, similar to the <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-mega-cycle-signals-repeat-of-2017-face-melting-rally/\">setup</a> that led to the 2017 rally. In that cycle, Ripple’s token rose more than 1,100%. If a similar move plays out, the projected target stands near $24.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1HyB_hWYAAxbfO.jpeg\"><graphic class=\"size-full wp-image-413011\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjAwIDU0NSIgd2lkdGg9IjEyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNTQ1IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFIeUJfaFdZQUF4YmZPLmpwZWciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTIwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSI1NDUiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"XRP price chart\" width=\"1200\" height=\"545\"/></a></p><p>Fibonacci levels above the current price include $8, $13, and $26. These levels represent possible zones if the current structure expands. Analysts are watching for a strong monthly close to confirm any continuation.</p><p>In addition, XRP futures are now $9.16 billion, followed by open interest. This reflects sustained activity in the derivatives market as XRP went to $3. The trend denotes that traders are holding exposure.

The signal occurs when the blue %K line moves above the orange %D line from the oversold zone.</p><p>Analyst Ash Crypto commented,</p><blockquote><p>BTC WEEKLY STOCHASTIC RSI HAS CROSSED UP, CONFIRMING A STRONG BULLISH SIGNAL</p><p>EVERY TIME THIS SIGNAL CAME IN THE PAST, BTC WAS OVERSOLD AND THEN PUMPED UP.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/4nRSG2c0AX</a><p>— Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>Similar crossovers were recorded in September 2023, January 2024, September 2024, and March 2025. Each time, Bitcoin followed with a sustained rise. The latest crossover appeared on September 8, 2025, with BTC trading near $117,600.</p><h2>Resistance Levels to Watch</h2><p>Bitcoin is now testing resistance around $119,000–$119,500, an area that has capped price advances in recent months. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe <a href=\"https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1968594485593489492\">remarked</a>,</p><blockquote><p>“The more important part; will $BTC break through this crucial resistance zone?”</p></blockquote><p>Failure to push higher could bring BTC back toward $114,700, or even $111,900, which traders see as a possible entry zone. A clean break above $119,500 would open the way to $123,288, the most recent high where liquidity was taken.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1HaPtuXcAEM3N0.jpg\"><graphic class=\"wp-image-413029 size-full\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjAwIDkyNyIgd2lkdGg9IjEyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iOTI3IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFIYVB0dVhjQUVNM04wLmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSIxMjAwIiBkYXRhLWg9IjkyNyIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"Bitcoin (BTC) price chart\" width=\"1200\" height=\"927\"/></a></p><h2>The $117,200 Pivot</h2><p>Analyst Ted pointed to $117,200 as a level to watch. Bitcoin was rejected here earlier, sending it below $115,000. He noted,</p><blockquote><p/><a href=\"\">$BTC</a>is trying to reclaim the $117,200 level.<p>It got rejected the other day, which led to a correction below $115,000.</p><p>If BTC is able to reclaim this level, a move towards $120,000 will happen.</p><p>If Bitcoin fails to reclaim this, a dump towards $113,000 could happen.</p><a href=\"\">pic.twitter.com/y2aTrWojIw</a><p>— Ted (@TedPillows)</p><a href=\"\">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote><p>In the chart, a breakout beyond $117,200 could move prices toward $120,000–$123,300. Conversely, a decrease in <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-bulls-eye-137k-but-only-if-this-support-holds-strong/\">momentum</a> would expose the support areas around $113,600–$114,000 with further downside toward $107,400–$108,600 and $101,000–$102,000.</p><p>In addition, Ted also <a href=\"https://x.com/TedPillows/status/1968646687121113517\">commented</a> on the broader cycle, saying, “BTC has historically peaked 1,070–1,080 days after bottom. This time, I’m expecting a longer cycle due to institutional arrival.” He suggested a possible peak in January or February 2026.</p><p>Analysts feel Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture: either confirming a breakout over resistance zones or <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/2-worrying-signs-for-bitcoin-btc-despite-the-expected-rate-cuts/\">retreating</a> to test lower levels once more.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p>Ethereum’s mid-sized whale cohort is sitting on massive paper gains, reaching levels not seen since the network’s last market peak almost four years ago.</p><p>Analyst CryptoOnchain has shared data showing wallets with between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH seeing unrealized profits rise to cycle highs, a sign that historically came right before selling pressure increased.</p><h2>Whale Wallet Profits Mirror Previous Market Top</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68cb10c16e8c203d2e2168c4-ETH-Unrealized-Profits-of-Mid-Sized-Whales-Hit-Levels-Last-Seen-at-ATH-in-Nov-20\">analysis</a>, this uptick in unrealized profits among average-sized whales highlights a stage in the cycle where investor psychology can significantly shape price action.</p><p>In previous instances, including the 2021 peak, such levels coincided with either large-scale profit-taking or, at a minimum, heightened selling pressure. While the data does not guarantee an imminent correction, it suggests that the market has entered a zone where whale decisions could dictate Ethereum’s near-term trajectory.</p><blockquote><p>“This does not necessarily mean an immediate correction,” wrote CryptoOnchain. “It highlights a critical stage in the cycle where investor psychology and whale behavior could heavily influence price action.”</p></blockquote><p>The timing of these gains is also notable. Ethereum has rallied more than 95% in the last year and 8.7% over the past month, and was trading at $4,591 at the time of this writing, just 6.9% below its record high of $4,946.</p><p>Furthermore, in the last week, ETH has oscillated between $4,404 and $4,762, with intraday swings between $4,440 and $4,637 in the past 24 hours. This ideally puts whales in a position of strength, as many of them accumulated at significantly lower levels during Ethereum’s consolidation phase.</p><p>Still, the market backdrop is complicating the whale picture. For example, as chartist Ali Martinez reported previously, big investors <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/90000-eth-in-just-2-days-is-ethereum-headed-for-a-big-correction/\">sold</a> 90,000 ETH worth more than $400 million in just 48 hours, leaving them with only 15.4 million tokens. Those moves may have been opportunistic profit-taking before yesterday’s Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/us-fed-slashes-interest-rates-by-25-bps-how-will-bitcoins-price-react/\">meeting</a>, but they also showed how quickly whale actions can change the market if sentiment turns.</p><h2>Institutional Signals and Price Trajectory</h2><p>Renewed institutional participation is also helping offset the risk of whale-driven sell-offs. Evidence of this was provided by CQ analyst PelinayPA on September 17, who highlighted that Ethereum’s Fund Market Premium (FMP), which compares futures prices to spot prices, has been steadily <a href=\"https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/68caaaef756c0b23f07c4e61-Ethereum-Fund-Market-Premium-Signals-Strong-Institutional-Support-Above-68K\">rising</a> since July. That trend shows that institutional buyers are willing to pay more than the current price for exposure, which is often seen as a sign of long-term rallies.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the charts, ETH remains pinned below the $4,850 resistance level after months of climbing within a steep ascending channel, as <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis-can-eth-push-toward-5k-as-bullish-momentum-returns/\">noted</a> in <i>CryptoPotato’s </i>latest pulse check. The asset continues to print higher highs and higher lows, supported by a bullish moving-average crossover, yet momentum is fading as traders await a breakout.</p><p>If whales decide to lock in profits, ETH could revisit the $4,000 zone. But if they hold, or if institutions absorb the selling, analysts see a realistic chance of the altcoin breaking above $5,000 before the month’s end.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-mid-sized-whales-see-unrealized-profits-soar-to-2021-ath-levels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

As <i>CryptoPotato</i> <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-etf-launch-imminent-latest-updates-revealed/\">reported</a>, the REX-Osprey XRP exchange-traded fund (under the ticker XRPR) is scheduled for launch today (September 18).</p><p>While the issuer described the investment vehicle as a spot ETF, some industry participants identified features that distinguish it from other such products. The popular Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett claimed it will operate as a “spot ETF with extras.”</p><blockquote><p>“To my understanding, it’s a spot product in a ’40 Act wrapper that holds real XRP plus cash, Treasuries, and some derivatives. Basically a spot ETF with extras, and is more regulated than traditional spot products,” she said.</p></blockquote><p>Contrary to the upcoming product, spot crypto ETFs that have already been approved in the United States are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which governs commodity-based trusts. For a detailed breakdown of how REX-Osprey’s ETF compares to standard spot ETFs, please read our article <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-stalls-xrp-and-doge-etf-rollout-how-they-differ-from-btc-and-eth-counterparts/\">here</a>.</p><p>Grayscale has also displayed its intentions to introduce a product that tracks the performance of numerous cryptocurrencies, including XRP.</p><p>Earlier today, CEO Peter Mintzberg <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sec-approves-grayscales-digital-large-cap-fund-for-trading/\">said</a> the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) for trading along with the Generic Listing Standards. He also added that the team is working “expeditiously” to launch the first multi-crypto asset ETP with BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA as underlying assets. </p><p>The GDLC is specifically designed to give investors exposure to some of the biggest cryptocurrencies, without requiring them to buy and store the coins themselves directly. It will track the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index and will operate with daily cash creation and redemption of 10,000-share baskets.</p><h2>Ripple’s Prestigious Partnership</h2><p>In addition to the breaking ETF news, the company <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-dbs-bank-franklin-templeton-tap-xrp-ledger-to-launch-tokenized-repo-markets/\">shook hands</a> with the global investment company Franklin Templeton (which has over $1.6 trillion in assets under management) and the leading bank in Singapore, DBS Bank. </p><p>According to the signed memorandum of understanding (MoU), the financial institution will list sgBENJ and RLUSD. The former is a tokenized version of Franklin Templeton’s US dollar money market fund, while the latter is Ripple’s stablecoin, which is pegged to the greenback.</p><blockquote><p>“With this setup, eligible DBS clients can trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, enabling them to rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the official announcement reads.</p></blockquote><p>In the next phase of the collaboration, the Singaporean bank plans to explore helping clients unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/big-day-for-ripple-and-xrp-etfs-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The trading volume for the same period was over $1.7 billion. Over the past week, the token is up 5%. The price is now testing the top of a downtrend channel that has held since earlier this year.</p><p>Chart analysis shows that SUI is approaching the upper boundary of the structure. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital <a href=\"https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1968463920328323344\">said</a>,</p><blockquote><p>“SUI is on the cusp of breaking out from this Downtrending Channel (light blue). A breakout would see SUI revisit the old All Time High area.”</p></blockquote><p>Notably, the previous high sits near $5.35. SUI has formed a series of higher lows in recent weeks. These moves suggest growing interest from buyers. The top of the channel, near $3.80, is a key area. If the price moves above this level and holds, it may open the way toward higher levels.</p><p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/G1FjgHyW4AAyJ_2.jpeg\"><graphic class=\"size-full wp-image-412931\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjAwIDg2OSIgd2lkdGg9IjEyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iODY5IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGY3J5cHRvcG90YXRvLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAyNSUyRjA5JTJGRzFGamdIeVc0QUF5Sl8yLmpwZWciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTIwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSI4NjkiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"SUI price chart\" width=\"1200\" height=\"869\"/></a></p><p>If the <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/sui-eyes-3-90-as-supply-shrinks-and-bulls-defend-crucial-support/\">breakout</a> fails, SUI could move back to support near $3.40. Below that, the next range sits between $2.33 and $2.00.

Therefore, investors’ fears are alleviated, and the market is likely to rally further in the coming weeks.</p><p>By Shayan</p><h2>The Daily Chart</h2><p>Bitcoin’s daily chart demonstrates a clear bounce from the $107K demand zone and a rise back above the 100-day moving average, located around the $113K mark. After yesterday’s Fed rate cut, the asset is continuing its path toward the $124K supply zone, which aligns with the current BTC all-time high.</p><p>The RSI is also trending above the 50% level, indicating that the momentum has now shifted bullish once again. All these signals point to a potential continuation toward the $124K ATH and likely a further rally toward $130K and even higher.</p><h2>The 4-Hour Chart</h2><p>As the 4-hour chart demonstrates, Bitcoin’s recent rally has occurred after the price successfully broke out of a descending channel, following a swift double bottom rebound at the $108K supply zone.</p><p>The asset has now swept the liquidity pool above the previous $107K high, which can lead to two possible scenarios. The market can either carry on with the uptrend and attack the $124K area once again, or it can pull back at least to the $112K order block, which is the most notable demand zone nearby. Yet, with the RSI still below the overbought region, the price seemingly has more room to grow before a correction occurs.</p><h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2><h3>Open Interest</h3><p>This chart displays the Bitcoin aggregate open interest, which shows the number of open perpetual futures positions. Typically, during bullish market conditions, this metric climbs higher or consolidates, as more and more traders are taking leveraged positions. This is exactly what can be seen on the chart.</p><p>Meanwhile, another interesting observation is that even with the market going through a short-term correction a few weeks ago, the open interest has yet to drop. While this is generally a bullish sign, it also points to the fact that the futures market might still be overheated. Therefore, there is still the probability for a liquidation cascade to happen in the short term, which could cause a flash crash before the market stabilizes again.</p><p><strong>Binance Free $600 (CryptoPotato Exclusive):</strong>(</p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600f/\">Use this link</a>to register a new account and receive $600 exclusive welcome offer on Binance<p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/binance600d/\">full details</a>).</p><p><strong>LIMITED OFFER for CryptoPotato readers at Bybit:</strong></p><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/pl/bybit24/\">Use this link</a>to register and open a $500 FREE position on any coin!<p>Disclaimer: Information found on CryptoPotato is those of writers quoted.
