They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.</p>\n    <p>As well as being grand occasions with lots of pageantry, governments use the visits to further Britain's interests.</p>\n    <p>Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term - such as Trump - are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush.</p>\n    <p>However, in February <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxxpxe5qko\">Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Trump an invitation from King Charles III</a> during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal.

    "body": "<p>Robert Redford, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1dqe9ey0kgo\">who has died at the age of 89</a>, appeared in more than 50 Hollywood films, won an Oscar as a director, and became a champion of independent film-makers, founding the annual Sundance Film Festival to showcase their work.</p>\n<p>Success meant he could pick and choose his projects, with many chiming with his politically liberal views. And he campaigned on environmental issues and for the rights of Native Americans.</p>\n<p>His all-American good looks couldn't be ignored: Redford was once described as \"a chunk of Mount Rushmore levered into stonewashed denims\".</p>\n<p>Another critic said he had \"a fluid physical grace and an inner radiance that sometimes makes it seem as if he's lit from within\".</p>\n<p>But overall, Redford thought his beauty was more of a hindrance than a help to his career - and said karma had brought tragedy in his family life to punish him for his physical good fortune.</p>\n<p>Charles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica, California, on 18 August 1936 - the son of a milkman who later became an accountant with Standard Oil.</p>\n<p>At school, he became part of a street gang and was arrested for \"borrowing an automobile that had stolen jewellery in its trunk\".</p>\n<p>He won a scholarship to the University of Colorado thanks to his prowess at baseball, but was thrown out after 18 months for drunkenness. At the same time, his mother died - aged just 40.</p>\n<p>Stricken with grief, he drifted for a while, finding work in the Californian oilfields - before travelling to Paris and Florence, where he studied art.</p>\n<p>His sojourn in Europe encouraged him to take a fresh approach to the United States: \"I began to look at my country from another point of view,\" he later said.</p>\n<p>Returning home, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Art with ambitions to become a theatrical designer - but quickly switched to acting.</p>\n<p>Like many actors in late 1950s New York, he picked up a number of small roles on stage and television, including parts in popular series such as The Untouchables, Perry Mason and Dr Kildare.</p>\n<p>His big-screen debut came in 1960 with a minor role in Tall Story, where he found himself working alongside Jane Fonda.</p>\n<p>It was not an auspicious start to his film career. The film flopped - with Time magazine opining that \"nothing can save this picture\".</p>\n<p>However, it did mark the beginning of a lifetime's friendship with Fonda, who later admitted to falling in love with him each time they worked together.</p>\n<p>\"There was always a mystery because he didn't reveal anything. He's got an aura about him,\" she said.</p>\n<p>His first major stage success was as pompous lawyer Paul Bratter in Neil Simon's romantic comedy Barefoot in the Park. It was a role he would reprise in the 1967 film version, opposite Fonda.</p>\n<p>In 1965, he picked up a Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer for his role in the film Inside Daisy Clover with Natalie Wood.</p>\n<p>But he was turned down for the part of Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate because director Mike Nichols felt he was too good-looking - which made Redford wary of being stereotyped by his appearance.</p>\n<p>Global fame came in 1969 with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</p>\n<p>The 33-year-old's portrayal of the laidback Kid, in contrast to Paul Newman's fast-talking Butch, proved to be one of Hollywood's great partnerships.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Redford nearly missed out on the part after one studio executive said: \"He's just another Hollywood blond. Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you'll hit six like him.\"</p>\n<p>The studio did everything it could to avoid hiring Redford, until Newman - a huge established star - stepped in and insisted.</p>\n<p>The two actors found they shared a love of theatre, and remained firm friends until Newman's death in 2008.</p>\n<p>\"We'd play tricks on each other,\" Redford said of his relationship with Newman. \"The more sophisticated the joke the better.\"</p>\n<p>In 1973, their natural on-screen chemistry saw them team up again in The Sting.</p>\n<p>Redford was Oscar-nominated for his role as Johnny Hooker, a small-time grifter who joins forces with Newman's character to swindle a vicious crime boss.</p>\n<p>The film, with its distinctive ragtime soundtrack, eventually won seven Academy Awards including best picture - although Redford was beaten to the best actor award by Jack Lemmon.</p>\n<p>It was the only time Redford was ever nominated in the best actor category at the Oscars, although he would later win as a director - and received an honorary Oscar in 2002.</p>\n<p>Redford's acting roles were prolific throughout the 70s, although there were mixed reviews for his turn as the enigmatic Gatsby in The Great Gatsby, and he was overshadowed by Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were.</p>\n<p>But in 1974, Redford bought the film rights to All the President's Men, an account of the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - the two Washington Post reporters who uncovered it.</p>\n<p>\"The Washington Post were very nervous about us - that this was Hollywood and it could hurt them,\" he recalled.</p>\n<p>Released in 1976, with Redford playing Woodward alongside Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, the film was a critical success, winning four Oscars - including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Jason Robards.</p>\n<p>Four years on, and Redford made his directorial debut with 1980's Ordinary People, a study of the collapse of a middle-class family after the death of one of their sons. It won him his first and only Oscar.</p>\n<p>With recognition came wealth.</p>\n<p>Redford used much of his earnings to buy a ski resort in Utah, his wife Lola's home state, which he renamed Sundance after one of his most famous roles.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, he founded the Sundance Institute to provide creative and financial support to independent film-makers. He went on to become chairman of the Utah/US Film Festival, later renamed the Sundance Film Festival.</p>\n<p>Over time, the festival became a key event in the film calendar, showcasing the work of many directors who went on to become household names, including Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh.</p>\n<p>In acting terms, there were hits and misses over the last two decades of the 20th Century. Prison drama Brubaker was a commercial and critical success, and there was a positive reception for popular dramas The Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal.</p>\n<p>Out of Africa won a fistful of awards, but Havana was badly received and lost money at the box office.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, Redford continued to direct, including A River Runs Through It - which gave a career boost to a fledgling Brad Pitt - and The Legend of Bagger Vance, the last film to feature Jack Lemmon.</p>\n<p>There was a muted reception for Lions for Lambs, which saw him reunited with Out of Africa's Meryl Streep. There was high praise, however, for his role in the groundbreaking All is Lost - about an elderly yachtsman alone on his damaged boat in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p>\"There's no dialogue, none at all. And I'm the only actor on screen in the whole movie,\" Redford said. Many critics described his performance as the best of his career.</p>\n<p>He also starred as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Alexander Pierce in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film far removed from his usual fare.</p>\n<p>\"I like the idea of stepping into new territory,\" he told the LA Times, in 2013. \"This is the kind of film I would love to have seen as a kid.\"</p>\n<p>Away from the studio, Redford became a prominent advocate for the environment. \"Ours is a sick planet because of our behaviour on it,\" he said in a 2014 interview.</p>\n<p>Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, and the couple had four children.</p>\n<p>Their youngest, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome aged two months.</p>\n<p>In interviews, Redford said he believed that karma had punished him for possessing sexual magnetism and leading the hedonistic life of an actor.</p>\n<p>\"It felt like retribution,\" he says. \"I always had this thing that death was on my shoulder, 24/7. My dogs, as a kid. My mum. My firstborn.\"</p>\n<p>The couple divorced in 1985, and Redford had lengthy romances with Brazilian actress Sonia Braga and costume assistant Kathy O'Rear. He married Sibylle Szaggars - a German-born artist - in 2009.</p>\n<p>In 2020, his son, David, died in his fifties from complications of bile duct cancer. He had been ill since birth and had had two liver transplants.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Redford announced his retirement from acting soon after his cameo in Avengers: Endgame. But he found it hard to leave the limelight.</p>\n<p>Approaching the age of 90, he reversed his decision a few years later - to appear in several episodes of Dark Winds, the story of two Navajo police officers who try to solve a double murder.</p>\n<p>Redford often shunned the Hollywood limelight, preferring to plough his own furrow.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckke5522r23o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

It says that Israel has breached the Genocide Convention that was passed in 1948 by the newly established United Nations. The word genocide, and the convention that defined it as a crime, were directly inspired by the genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany.</p>\n    <p>Israel denies all allegations that its conduct in Gaza has broken the treaties and conventions that make up the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It justifies its actions as self-defence, in protection of its citizens and to force the release of the hostages taken by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 7 October 2023, around 20 of whom are believed still to be alive.</p>\n    <p>The Israelis have dismissed the report as antisemitic lies inspired by Hamas. It was compiled by a commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Israel and the US are boycotting the Council, which both countries say is biased against them.</p>\n    <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">findings of the report</a> will feed into the growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct, which is also coming from Israel's traditional western allies as well as the Gulf Arab monarchies that normalised relations with Israel in the Abraham Accords.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2540/live/176a43c0-92c8-11f0-a03a-79264f13f66e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A line of people walk down a dirt road, surrounded on each side by tall piles of destroyed buildings. \"/>\n    <p>Next week at the UN General Assembly in New York, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada and others are due to join the majority of UN members by recognising the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state.</p>\n    <p>The move will be more than symbolic. It will change the debate about the future of the conflict that began more than a century ago when Zionist Jews from Europe came to settle in Palestine. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has condemned recognition as antisemitic, and a reward for Hamas terrorism.</p>\n    <p>He says the Palestinians will never have independence in any part of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as a Palestinian state would put Israelis in danger. Israeli religious nationalists believe the land was granted to the Jewish people alone by God.</p>\n    <p>Genocide is defined in the 1948 convention, as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group – in this case, Palestinians in Gaza.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7746/live/2471d600-92c8-11f0-a03a-79264f13f66e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A bustling crowd of crying children hold out pots to be filled with food. \"/>\n    <p>The report details actions against Palestinians inside Gaza and in jails inside Israel.</p>\n    <p>Among a long list of accusations is Israeli targeting of civilians that it has a legal obligation to protect, and the imposition of \"inhumane conditions causing the death of Palestinians, including the deprivation of food, water and medicines\". That is a reference to the blockade that has produced a famine as well as widespread starvation, according to the IPC, the international body that assesses food emergencies.</p>\n    <p>The new UN report also details forced displacement, currently happening in Gaza City after the Israeli military, the IDF, ordered all civilians there to move south. Around one million people are believed to be affected. Israel's offensive is gathering pace, with air strikes and the destruction of many buildings, including high rises that are symbols of Gaza City, which the IDF calls Hamas \"terror towers\".</p>\n    <p>The report also says that Israel has imposed \"measures intended to prevent births\". That refers to an attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic that reportedly destroyed around 4000 embryos and 1000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.</p>\n    <p>As well as the results of military action, the UN report singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e6d0/live/5ffe8fe0-92c0-11f0-a44e-f5956a270ddc.jpg.webp\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Netanyahu, Herzog and Gallant stand aside several others at a ceremony. The expressions are serious, or sombre, and most people are wearing suits or military attire. \"/>\n    <p>They are Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister, who said on 9 October 2023 that Israel was fighting \"human animals\". Like Prime Minister Netanyahu, Gallant already faces an arrest warrant for war crimes from the International Criminal Court.</p>\n    <p>Netanyahu is also accused of incitement by comparing the Gaza war to the story of the Jewish fight against an enemy known as Amalek. In the bible God tells the Jewish people to eliminate all the Amalek men, women and children, as well as their possessions and their animals.</p>\n    <p>The third official singled out is President Isaac Herzog, who in the first week of the war condemned Gaza's Palestinians for not rising up against Hamas. He said on 13 October 2023 that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\".</p>\n    <p>Legally, it is hard to prove the crime of genocide. The people who framed the Genocide Convention, and interpretations made by the ICJ in more recent cases deliberately set a high legal bar.</p>\n    <p>At the International Court of Justice in The Hague, South Africa has brought a case that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians.

She is smiling wearing a black t-shirt with the polished wooden floor and a large mirror of the studio in soft focus in the background.\"/>\n    <p>At a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.</p>\n    <p>Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62lnzdndkeo\">a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April</a>, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.</p>\n    <p>Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home.</p>\n    <p>\"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"</p>\n    <p>Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.</p>\n    <p>The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.</p>\n    <p>Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.</p>\n    <p>The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet.</p>\n    <p>The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.</p>\n    <p>It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.</p>\n    <p>That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.</p>\n    <p>\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.</p>\n    <p>Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending.</p>\n    <p>And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head. She is wearing a black t-shirt and is standng in a dance studio. In the background there is a window with curtains on the left and a white door at the back.\"/>\n    <p>Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now.</p>\n    <p>That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.</p>\n    <p>As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.</p>\n    <p>The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".</p>\n    <p>So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation.</p>\n    <p>Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that.</p>\n    <p>Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.</p>\n    <p>The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4gnk7g228o\">the row over the winter fuel payment</a>, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.</p>\n    <p>That is not just the case with current retirees.</p>\n    <p>Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.</p>\n    <p>Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.</p>\n    <p>There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.</p>\n    <p>No-one said getting older was easy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Later on Tuesday, he ordered the deadline extended again, until 16 December.</p>\n    <p>The US president said a buyer will be announced soon.</p>\n    <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that under a deal being negotiated between the US and China, TikTok's U.S. business would be controlled by an investor consortium that would include tech company Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p>\n    <p>In a new US entity created under the deal, US investors would hold a roughly 80% stake and Americans would dominate the board, with one member selected by the US government, according to the Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter.</p>\n    <p>US users, meanwhile, would move to a new app, currently in the testing phase, that will have content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance. TikTok's algorithms are a top reason for the app's success.</p>\n    <p>Earlier, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/tiktok-bytedance-oracle-china.html\">CNBC reported</a> the deal would include a mix of current and new investors, and would be completed in the next 30 to 45 days.</p>\n    <p>It also said Oracle would keep its existing agreement to host TikTok servers inside the US.

In Scotland, ministers planned to mitigate some of those cuts.</p>\n    <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the move was needed owing to the state of the public finances.</p>\n    <p>The policy's impact on different areas of the country is revealed in the newly-published figures.</p>\n    <p>In areas with a higher proportion of low-income pensioners, many still received the winter fuel payment.

You either fight back or you die.\"</p>\n    <p>He also said there had to be \"a change of government in Britain\" and that there should be a \"dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held\".</p>\n    <p>Responding to his comments, Mahmood said: \"Whether you're a hostile state or a hostile billionaire, no-one gets to mess with British democracy.\"</p>\n    <p>She added that the \"vast majority\" of people would react to Musk's words with \"a shake of the head\".</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also criticised Musk, telling the BBC: \"He doesn't use language sensibly, he is deeply irresponsible, deeply dangerous.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, Sir Ed had said British democracy was \"too precious to be a plaything for foreign tech barons\" adding: \"Elon Musk doesn't care about the British people or our rights. He only cares about himself and his ego.\"</p>\n    <p>Musk said Sir Ed was \"a craven coward\".</p>\n    <p>Up to 150,000 people attended the \"Unite The Kingdom\" march in London organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson.</p>\n    <p>Around 5,000 joined a counter-protest organised by Stand Up To Racism.</p>\n    <p>Speakers at the main protest expressed anti-immigration sentiments and spoke in favour of freedom of speech.</p>\n    <p>As part of the event, Musk had a conversation with Robinson during which he made his controversial comments.</p>\n    <p>Musk said: \"I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.</p>\n    <p>\"This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives.</p>\n    <p>\"They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business.</p>\n    <p>\"My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comments in Parliament, Mahmood said Britain was \"a tolerant country and yes, we are a diverse country\".</p>\n    <p>\"You can be English with roots that stretched back a thousand years.</p>\n    <p>\"But you can also be English and look like me.\"</p>\n    <p>Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman echoed Mahmood's comments saying: \"The last thing the British people want is this sort of dangerous and inflammatory language which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets.</p>\n    <p>\"I don't think the British people will have any truck with that kind of language and rightly so.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked if the government would review its use of X, the spokesman said government communications were always kept under review.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to rule out awarding contracts to Musk's Tesla company which produces electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002jjr0\">Speaking to Newsnight,</a> Sir Ed said: \"He [Musk] has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v3333rlp7o \">applied to Ofgem</a> for a licence to sell and distribute energy in this country... they are the sorts of things we should look at.\" </p>\n    <p>He also said he would encourage people to leave Musk's social media platform X but that he would be staying, saying the Liberal Democrats were \"calling him out on his own platform\".</p>\n    <p>Taking questions at a press conference on Monday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was also asked about Musk's language.</p>\n    <p>He said there was a \"degree of ambiguity\" in his words but added: \"If the fight that Musk was talking about was about standing up for our rights and free speech, if it was about fighting in elections to overcome the established parties, then that absolutely is the fight that we're in.\"</p>\n    <p>Musk had previously expressed support for Farage and had reportedly been in talks over donating money to the party.</p>\n    <p>However, earlier this year he appeared to cool on the idea, saying Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party.</p>\n    <p>Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Musk's rhetoric was \"the wrong kind of tone\", but added \"we need to deal with some of the fundamentals of what is driving some of these comments\".</p>\n    <p>\"We live in an increasingly divisive society,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>\"We know that illegal migration is playing a part in that, and we need to have this government get a grip on that.\"</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m4rz0pvmno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

For each person returned to France, the UK will accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.</p>\n    <p>No one has been removed under the scheme. The first returns to France had been expected to begin from as early as Tuesday.</p>\n    <p>Over the last fortnight, some migrants being held in immigration removal centres, received letters that said they would be put on a scheduled Air France flight departing from Heathrow Airport for Paris at 9am this morning.</p>\n    <p>However, a number of sources told the BBC that some of the potential passengers had been told their departure would be deferred as further representations about their cases were made.</p>\n    <p>Asked by reporters before the High Court ruling if the scheme was a \"shambles\", a government spokesperson said \"no\".</p>\n    <p>They added that the government was \"confident in the legal basis for this pilot, we've taken steps to ensure it's compliant with domestic and international law, as with any policy, we're prepared to respond to any legal scrutiny that occurs\".</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dqe2443l1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Many have described severe congestion, endless queues of cars and trucks, and long delays, with families stranded on the roadside while airstrikes continue overhead.</p>\n    <p>The operation has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UN human rights chief and German foreign minister.</p>\n    <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the offensive \"utterly reckless and appalling\", saying it would \"only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages\".</p>\n    <p>But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to offer tacit support for Israel's operation during a joint press conference with Netanyahu on Monday, saying the US preferred a negotiated end to the war, but that \"sometimes when you're dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that's not possible\".</p>\n    <p>Israel's ramped up offensive comes as a United Nations commission of inquiry released a report on Tuesday that says <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8641wv0n4go\">Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza</a>.

So, we'll talk to them.\"</p>\n    <p>His comments will be welcomed by Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, who said that tariff relief for British steel is being negotiated.</p>\n    <p>Senior government sources insist there \"remains a path to zero\".</p>\n    <p>Over the weekend, Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the Commons Business and Trade Committee, said the state visit is \"no mere pageant\" and warned the government that \"we can't escape the truth that Britain now trades with its biggest partner on terms that are worse than the past\".</p>\n    <p>An agreement to reduce the tariffs to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July.</p>\n    <p>At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as \"devastating\".</p>\n    <p>However, industry sources told the BBC on Tuesday that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%.</p>\n    <p>One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry. Gareth Stace from UK Steel said the UK should do the same.</p>\n    <p>\"It is even more imperative now that the UK government beefs up its own trade defences to ensure UK steelmakers have a sustainable share of their own market. In these market conditions, the last country to protect their industry will be the first to lose it,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>A government spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change.\"</p>\n    <p>\"We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.\"</p>\n    <p>Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development.</p>\n    <p>\"The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UK's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027.</p>\n    <p>The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress.

Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.</p>\n    <p>But, in July, a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d6e4d8v8mo\">panel of senior high court judges ruled</a> that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\". </p>\n    <p>They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.</p>\n    <p>Later the same month, the IPT also rejected MI5's explanations and requested a new investigation.</p>\n    <p>The tribunal also said its concerns were not confined only to the possibility of contempt of court but to wider questions of whether the duty of candour was fully complied with by MI5 and the government, and whether it is possible to identify individuals who were responsible for that failure, potentially including government lawyers.</p>\n    <p>The duty of candour requires public bodies to be open and honest in disclosing relevant information in legal proceedings.</p>\n    <p>In a statement today, Sir Brian Leveson said: \"I have received Sir Ken McCallum's assurance that the inspection team will have access to legally privileged material where this is required.\"</p>\n    <p>The new investigation's terms of reference say it should consider the circumstances resulting in the \"provision of false evidence to both the High Court and to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, including the degree of compliance with the duty of candour, in proceedings connected with Agent X.\"</p>\n    <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Home Secretary is concerned that inaccurate evidence was provided to the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The Director General of MI5 has rightly apologised for this serious failing, both publicly and to the Courts.\"</p>\n    <p>Kate Ellis, the joint head of the Centre for Women's Justice who acts for Agent X's former girlfriend, said she welcomed the prime minister's decision on further investigation.</p>\n    <p>\"The reliance on false evidence in court is, self-evidently, profoundly serious and raises concerns that there may have been a deliberate contempt of court,\" she added.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn834zwe83lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

They told me there's insufficient evidence to prosecute and he's agreed to pay it back,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Another source involved with the business account said they also understood the ex-MP's agreement to repay funds to be part of the reason the police had closed the investigation.</p>\n    <p>Menzies is not thought to have found employment since he stood down as an MP but the Conservative party confirmed they had given him a hardship loan which is understood to be a five-figure sum.</p>\n    <p>He was first elected in 2010. He resigned as a ministerial aide in 2014, after being accused of paying for sex from a male sex worker, allegations which he denied at the time.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's political career ended in April last year after a newspaper report revealed that he had been accused of misusing campaign funds given by local donors in his constituency.</p>\n    <p>The money had been paid to a \"business group\", with a bank account set up and administered by Ms Fieldhouse and another local Conservative volunteer.</p>\n    <p>In December 2023, he called Ms Fieldhouse at 3am, waking her from her sleep and asking her to send him thousands of pounds of the donated money.</p>\n    <p>He claimed it was \"a matter of life and death\", she has said, with men holding him in a London flat and refusing to release him unless he paid up.</p>\n    <p>The former MP subsequently denied the men in the flat he labelled \"bad people\" were sex workers.</p>\n    <p>A source close to him instead told The Times that he'd met a man on an online dating website, subsequently gone to the flat of a second man,<strong> </strong>and then been falsely accused of being sick before facing demands for a large sum to pay for cleaning.</p>\n    <p>However, one of the men present at the flat has admitted they had agreed to have sex with Menzies for payment.</p>\n    <p>The man, who is Brazilian, advertises himself as a \"high-class male escort\" and said he had participated in a \"party\" with Menzies and several other escorts.</p>\n    <p>The gathering lasted from Wednesday night to Friday morning, with Menzies absent from a full day of parliamentary work.</p>\n    <p>At its conclusion, Menzies didn't have sufficient funds to pay his bill, which amounted to more than £14,000, according to an account he later gave a close aide.</p>\n    <p>The Brazilian man denied that Menzies had ever been locked in but said there were \"lots of other guys\" and the then-MP \"hadn't paid anyone\".</p>\n    <p>He said he was not aware that Menzies was a politician and when informed of this added that he was \"surprised [b]ut that's his problem, I have nothing to do with it\".</p>\n    <p>\"My contact with him was just for work and ended there,\" he said.</p>\n    <p>As well as telephoning Ms Fieldhouse to demand money from the campaign funds account, Menzies summoned a male aide in his 30s to travel from Manchester to London to meet him at the flat where the \"party\" had taken place.</p>\n    <p>The aide said he was also asked for money, and he and a family member ended up handing over around £1,500.</p>\n    <p>Menzies received a further £6,500 from his office manager. She was subsequently reimbursed from the campaign fund.</p>\n    <p>After meeting the MP at the flat, the male aide said he accompanied Menzies and two sex workers to a nearby bank, waiting in a neighbouring cafe while the politician withdrew cash.</p>\n    <p>Menzies's alleged efforts to repay the male aide led to an investigation by Ipsa, the expenses watchdog.</p>\n    <p>The aide said that Menzies's office manager gave him £1,000 from the money she had been reimbursed from the local business group's account, but he was still owed £500 which the MP told him he couldn't afford to pay.</p>\n    <p>He alleged that Menzies instead told him he would arrange for a bonus payment to be made through his parliamentary staffing budget.</p>\n    <p>Ipsa, which investigated this claim as an allegation of fraud, found that Menzies had signed off a bonus payment for the aide \"a few days after the incident in question\". This was the only time the aide received a bonus and was described as being for work he had done on a wind farm application.</p>\n    <p>The bonus was for £700, amounting to around £500 after tax.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/w59ykwiqehvh/3YnHUeKx52oK5dWRUMHMqO/e318efae337c17e4a3abb339f7a10826/Closure_report_MM.pdf\">In a report on its investigation published on Tuesday</a>, Ipsa's compliance officer said that he had found the case \"not proven\".</p>\n    <p>He wrote that there was \"evidence of wrongdoing\", including the timing of the payment, but stated that the aide was \"non-committal\" in his statement to the police on whether it was for wind farm work or to reimburse him, and that there was a discrepancy over the amount because he'd claimed to be owed £1,000.</p>\n    <p>Another of Menzies's former staffers also told Ipsa the payment was legitimately for the aide's wind farm work.</p>\n    <p>The aide told the BBC that he had done work on a wind farm, but that was just the excuse Menzies used for the bonus which he told him was actually to reimburse him for the money he had lent him to pay sex workers.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

They are both smiling.\"/>\n    <p>More than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on<strong> </strong>the government's approach to tackling addiction.</p>\n    <p>Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.</p>\n    <p>The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to correct data and it is understood ministers are now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.</p>\n    <p>A former senior civil servant said fewer people might have died if drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.</p>\n    <p>Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.</p>\n    <p>Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.</p>\n    <p>The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.</p>\n    <p>The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.</p>\n    <p>Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.</p>\n    <p>Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.</p>\n    <p>The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.</p>\n    <p>Sir Philip Rutnam, who was the most senior civil servant at the Home Office between 2017 and 2020, told the BBC it was \"quite possible\" that fewer people would have died, if the government's drug policies had been based on accurate statistics.</p>\n    <p>He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: \"It really does matter, first of all the level of attention given to these issues, but then specifically it will affect decisions on how much funding to put into health-related programmes, treatment programmes, or into different bits of the criminal justice system.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.</p>\n    <p>His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.</p>\n    <p>\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.</p>\n    <p>At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".</p>\n    <p>He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.</p>\n    <p>\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"</p>\n    <p>Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.</p>\n    <p>Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".</p>\n    <p>She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"</p>\n    <p>The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.</p>\n    <p>Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.</p>\n    <p>David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.</p>\n    <p>Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction.</p>\n    <p>Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"</p>\n    <p>She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"</p>\n    <p>The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"</p>\n    <p>The flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.</p>\n    <p>Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.</p>\n    <p>The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.</p>\n    <p>Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg3zxyj5l2o\">a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling</a>.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

That will take it to £9,607 a year, a rise of £431.60 compared with now.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>With inflation forecast to be 4% in September, it is likely Tuesday's average earnings growth figure will be used to set the increase in the state pension<strong> </strong>for the third year in a row.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.</p>\n    <p>The standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying income tax.</p>\n    <p>Sir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027.</p>\n    <p>\"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wdgk7ggezo\">Linda, a retired hairdresser from Wokingham, told the BBC</a> she was worried her state pension was being pushed towards the tax threshold.</p>\n    <p>\"They're giving it on one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a load of good,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>\"If they could raise the tax threshold it would make a huge difference.\"</p>\n    <p>The pensioner said she would struggle to manage on the state pension if she lived on her own.</p>\n    <p>\"I'm lucky that my husband's got a good pension so we have a fairly reasonable lifestyle but if left alone I don't know what would happen to be honest.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab20/live/f22a1d90-92ce-11f0-a72d-3fad567a173a.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Linda has a brown fringe and her hair is tied back behind her head.

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>Unassuming wooden crates filled with brake pads and metal springs are piled high in the loading bay of the Broadbent factory close to Huddersfield city centre. Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves\">Rachel Reeves</a>, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.</p>\n    <p>Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/14/national-farmers-union-uk-rachel-reeves-meeting-report-inheritance-tax-reforms\">caused shock and anger among farmers</a> – would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.</p>\n    <p>Once assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.</p>\n    <p>Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.</p>\n    <p>He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.</p>\n    <p>“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”</p>\n    <p>Broadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.</p>\n    <p>Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.</p>\n    <p>HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.</p>\n    <p>Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.</p>\n    <p>When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar way <a href=\"https://obr.uk/efo/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-october-2024/#:~:text=Table%203.4%3A%20Costing%20of%20changes%20to%20the%20inheritance%20tax%20regime\">would be £500m a year from 2027/28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.</p>\n    <p>Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.</p>\n    <p>Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.</p>\n    <p>Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.</p>\n    <p>A study by CBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">Economics</a> found that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.</p>\n    <p>CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.</p>\n    <p>Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.</p>\n    <p>He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.</p>\n    <p>These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.</p>\n    <p>“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-25\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“I get that the government needs tax revenues to improve public services, but I am concerned that changes to business assets relief is a backward step.</p>\n    <p>“The alternative is that firms like this are owned by private equity … focused on the money and not the people or the local community.</p>\n    <p>“Britain should follow the German model that recognises family businesses,” he says.</p>\n    <p>Germany’s Mittelstand business community is famous as the bedrock of the country’s manufacturing miracle. Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.</p>\n    <p>The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.</p>\n    <p>German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.</p>\n    <p>Only when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.</p>\n    <p>Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.familienunternehmer.eu/index.html\">Family Business Association</a> in Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.</p>\n    <p>“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”</p>\n    <p>Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.</p>\n    <p>“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.</p>\n    <p>A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.</p>\n    <p>“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.</p>\n    <p>Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.</p>\n    <p>He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/family-firms-labour-tax-rises-manufacturers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>State pension on course for 4.7% rise under triple lock</p>\n<p>UK pensioners can look forward to a 4.7% increase in their state pensions next year, if the government sticks with the triple-lock.</p>\n<p>This morning’s labour market data shows that average wage growth (including bonuses) was 4.7% between May to July.</p>\n<p>That is the figure used in the triple lock formula which dictates that the state pension will increase in line with average wages, inflation or 2.5% each year, whichever is higher.</p>\n<p>Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:</p>\n<p>“State pensioners look on course to get an 4.7% uplift in their state pension next year as average wage growth remained robust. Such an increase would see a full new state pension rise from its current level of £230.25 per week to £241.05 per week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 per week to £184.75.</p>\n<p>However, the hike is not yet set in stone. We are awaiting the final piece of the triple lock puzzle – September’s inflation data to be published next month and if this surpasses 4.7% then we could see an even bigger increase. However, given that inflation currently sits at 3.8% it seems likely that wage growth will be the key figure here.</p>\n<p>Morrissey adds that the system creates some complexity for pensioners:</p>\n<p>Those on the new state pension will receive the uplift but those on the basic state pension will only receive it on their main state pension. Any further top ups such as the state second pension are usually uprated in line with inflation instead, so they won’t get the full benefit of the triple lock on their entire payment.</p>\n<p>Rachel Vahey, head of public policy at AJ Bell, points out that the state pensions will be close to the personal allowance of £12,570 – pensioners with additional income (such as a second pension) would then pay income tax on earnings over that limit.</p>\n<p>Vahey says:</p>\n<p>“Pensioners will be rejoicing at the prospect of an inflation-busting rise to the state pension from April next year as a result of the triple lock guarantee, with the latest ONS earnings growth figure coming in at 4.7% for the period between May and July of this year.</p>\n<p>“Under the triple lock guarantee, the state pension will rise by the highest of average earnings growth in May to July, September’s inflation figure or 2.5%. Provided inflation doesn’t spike above 4.7% in September, all stars point to these latest earnings figures boosting the new state pension to £12,534.60 from April 2026 – putting it above £12,000 for the first time ever and perilously close to the frozen personal allowance.</p>\n<p>The triple lock is a political pledge, not laid down in legislation, so pensions aren’t guaranteed to rise as outlined above. But in July, then work and pensions secretary LizKendall said the government was commited to the pensions triple lock “for the entirety of this Parliament”….</p>\n<p>Millions of people are poised for an above-inflation 4.7% increase in their state pension payments, adding to pressure on the government finances as Rachel Reeves explores raising taxes at the autumn budget.</p>\n<p>Labour has committed to retaining the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees annual increases in line with whichever is the higher of 2.5%, inflation in September or annual earnings growth in the three months to July.</p>\n<p>Official figures published on Tuesday show average weekly earnings including bonuses were 4.7% higher in May to July than in the same period a year earlier.</p>\n<p>Experts said the increase put state pensioners in line for their payments to go up by that amount from next April because inflation in September – currently running at 3.8% – was unlikely to be higher.</p>\n<p>A final decision will be taken by the government before the budget. However, PatMcFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners. It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n<p>Jaguar Land Rover has extended its shutdown on car production, as Britain’s biggest carmaker grapples with the aftermath of a cyber-attack.</p>\n<p>JLR said it would freeze production until at least next Wednesday, 24 September, as it continues its investigations into the hack, which first emerged earlier this month.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer said:</p>\n<p>“We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.</p>\n<p>“We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.”</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow’s US interest rate decision, a hawkish tone from the Fed could spark a ‘sell the news’ pullback in the markets.</p>\n<p>So suggests Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at investment and trading platform IG:</p>\n<p>“Despite the dramatic build-up to tomorrow’s nailed-on rate cut, the dull reality is that a 25bps move is merely the expected result. What everyone is watching for is any hint of more cuts to come.</p>\n<p>“Markets have merrily priced in a progression of easing moves in October and December, but if the committee strikes a more hawkish note, then we may finally see some volatility emerge with traders ‘selling the news’.

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.</p>\n    <h2>What is the triple lock?</h2>\n    <p>The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">The average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n  <p class=\"dcr-130mj7b\">2.5%.</p></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <h2>How many people get the state pension?</h2>\n    <p>There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.</p>\n    <p>To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.</p>\n    <p>People born after those dates claim the new state pension.</p>\n    <p>The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.</p>\n    <p>The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.</p>\n    <h2>What is the rise from next April?</h2>\n    <p>It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.</p>\n    <p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\">annual growth in earnings was 4.7%</a> for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.</p>\n    <p>The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts\">It was 3.8% in July</a> and is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.</p>\n    <p>The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.</p>\n    <h2>Is the triple lock popular?</h2>\n    <p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.</p>\n    <p>Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.</p>\n    <p>Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.</p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/08/uk-public-finances-obr-national-debt-gdp\">cost about three times more than initially expected</a> and suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.</p>\n    <p>Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.</p>\n    <p>Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.</p>\n    <h2>Could the triple lock be ditched?</h2>\n    <p>The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.</p>\n    <p>The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.</p>\n    <p>“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”</p>\n    <p>He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.</p>\n    <p>Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.</p>\n    <p>“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.</p>\n    <p>“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/16/uk-state-pension-what-is-the-triple-lock-and-could-it-be-ditched\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

However, Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that the triple lock promise would be honoured.</p>\n    <p>“That’s a commitment from the Labour government to the UK’s pensioners,” he said. “It’s something that we said we’d do at the election and something that we will keep to.”</p>\n    <p>The latest figures are expected to translate into an annual rise worth more than £500 for those on the new state pension, which would increase from £230.25 a week to £241.05 a week from April. Those retiring on the basic state pension would see their weekly income increase from £176.45 a week to £184.75.</p>\n    <p>Successive governments have committed to the triple lock since it was first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">introduced by George Osborne in 2010</a>, despite criticism that protecting pensioner incomes comes with a costly price tag for the public purse and risks fuelling intergenerational inequalities.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/pensions-triple-lock/giv-32554W27OC1D30JFH/\">graphic</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that state pension costs will rise from about 5% of GDP now to about 8% by the 2070s. Half of the increase is driven by the triple lock, at a time of rising pressure on other areas of spending and social care.</p>\n    <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called for the policy to be scrapped. Heidi Karjalainen, a senior research economist at the thinktank, said: “The triple lock has so far been much costlier than initially expected, and it creates a lot of uncertainty in terms of future spending.</p>\n    <p>“If the economy is doing well then it won’t cost more than increasing the state pension in line with average earnings growth, whereas in volatile periods it can become very costly – as we have seen in the last decade and a half.”</p>\n    <p>It comes as official figures showed the UK’s jobs market has continued to cool, amid a slowdown in annual pay growth and rising redundancies.</p>\n    <p>The ONS said annual growth in regular earnings excluding bonuses slowed to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the three months to June, matching the forecasts of City economists.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-15\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The official unemployment rate was unchanged on the previous month in July, at 4.7%, the highest level in four years.</p>\n    <p>Business groups have complained since Reeves’s first autumn budget that her £25bn increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/30/a-bitter-blow-british-pubs-restaurants-and-hospitality-firms-brace-for-rise-in-nics\">employer national insurance contributions</a> and 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” would force them to cut jobs and raise prices for consumers.</p>\n    <p>Economists said there was clear evidence of the jobs market cooling. Separate figures from HMRC showed a decline in the number of workers on company payrolls of 8,000, matching City forecasts.</p>\n    <p>After taking account of inflation, annual growth in regular pay was 1.2% in the three months to July, down from 1.5%.</p>\n    <p>Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her autumn budget. However, business leaders have warned a weaker growth outlook will make it harder for her to raise taxes without further harming the economy.</p>\n    <p>Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said Labour had committed an act of “self sabotage” by pushing more people out of work. “[It has put] even more pressure on already stretched public services and leaving businesses scrambling just to keep the lights on.”</p>\n    <p>Strong wage growth has caused a headache for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> by stoking inflationary pressures, putting further interest rate cuts at risk after four reductions in the past year. However, a deeper slowdown in the jobs market could show the economy is deteriorating, supporting faster rate cuts.</p>\n    <p>The Bank is expected to keep its base rate unchanged at 4% at its next policy meeting on Thursday.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/16/uk-labour-market-pay-growth-job-losses-rachel-reeves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.</p>\n    <p>Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.</p>\n    <p>Trump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.</p>\n    <p>He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chair <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, when they repeatedly defied these calls.</p>\n    <p>While Powell has signaled the Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">gearing up to resume rate cuts</a>, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">the labor market has stalled</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">inflation picked up</a>, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.</p>\n    <p>The administration has played down these official reports – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">fired one of the officials</a> responding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-ej-antoni\">ardent supporter of his agenda</a>, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.</p>\n    <p>While Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.</p>\n    <p>The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/24/trump-lawfare-mortgage-fraud-lisa-cook\">unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud</a>. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.</p>\n    <p>Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.</p>\n    <p>Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates.

I'm making sure people understand what Conservative values are.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger's defection is damaging for Badenoch, not only as a Tory thinker and veteran, but also as the most significant among several from the party moving to Reform.</p>\n    <p>Speaking after the press conference, Kruger told the BBC he had come to the conclusion the Conservative Party doesn't have \"any chance\" of winning the next election.</p>\n    <p>A few weeks ago, Kruger said he agreed with Reform on many issues except public spending, <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-07-15/debates/5A153C4B-4507-48BB-B340-F8C9CDC85C17/WelfareSpending?highlight=%22drunken%22#contribution-4FBEEF75-D201-473F-88C0-4AA6CE76E83C\">telling MPs in July</a>: \"There is a problem: they would spend money like drunken sailors.\"</p>\n    <p>Asked about his comment, Kruger said: \"I think we're all sober sailors now, I'm glad to say, because since I said that Reform have corrected their position on welfare spending.</p>\n    <p>\"I was very concerned that we need to really reduce overall benefit spending... Nigel made clear he also wants to bring down overall benefit spending but he does want to support families with children.\"</p>\n    <p>Kruger is the second sitting MP to join Reform UK. Lee Anderson, who was previously a Tory MP, sat as an independent before joining Reform in 2024.</p>\n    <p>Reform now have five MPs in the Commons, having seen two of their MPs elected in the 2024 general election, Rupert Lowe and James McMurdock, leave the party.</p>\n    <p>In 2005, Kruger was working at Conservative campaign headquarters when he was selected as the Conservative candidate to stand against the then-prime minister Tony Blair.</p>\n    <p>However, he stepped back over comments about wanting a \"period of creative destruction\" in public services.</p>\n    <p>His political jobs have included serving as former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's speechwriter, penning the \"hug a hoodie\" speech, and as former political secretary to Boris Johnson when he was prime minister.</p>\n    <p>A keen Brexiteer, Kruger described the Brexit vote as \"a heroic blow for a better model\". In May this year, he criticised Reform for \"piggybacking\" on the Tories' work during a debate on Brexit \"in a desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the Conservative party\".</p>\n    <p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-65612836\">Kruger was one of the speakers </a>at a National Conservatism Conference, an event organised by a right-wing think tank from the United States, and told delegates that marriages between men and women were \"the only possible basis for a safe and successful society\" and one that \"wider society should recognise and reward\".</p>\n    <p>Kruger, the son of TV chef Prue Leith, is an old Etonian, and studied at Edinburgh and Oxford Universities before becoming a director at the Centre for Policy Studies and later a senior fellow at the Legatum Institute.</p>\n    <p>A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"Nigel Farage can recruit as many failed Tories as he likes – it won't change the fact that he has no plan for Britain.</p>\n    <p>\"Britain deserves better than Reform's Tory tribute act that would leave working people paying a very high price.\"</p>\n    <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper labelled the Conservative Party \"a shell of its former self\" and said Badenoch had pushed lifelong Tories towards her party \"in their droves\".</p>\n    <p>\"Nigel Farage's party is shapeshifting into the Conservatives in front of our very eyes,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Green Party co-deputy leader Rachel Millward said Kruger's defection \"does serve as a loud alarm bell for the rest of us about the threats to this country if Reform UK were ever to form a government.\"</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4c9f/live/d67d32f0-6b8f-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox”.

Britain's engineering firm Rolls Royce has been selected to design and build the first in the country.</p>\n    <p>One of the commercial deals set to be signed this week is with US nuclear group X-Energy and the UK's Centrica, which owns British Gas, to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool.</p>\n    <p>Unlike SMRs, which are water-cooled nuclear reactors, advanced modular reactors use gases such as helium as a coolant.</p>\n    <p>There are very few AMRs in the world operating on a commercial basis such as China's HTR-PM reactor.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy wants to build one in the US but, after announcing a partnership with US chemicals and plastics giant Dow in 2021, it has taken until March this year to submit a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project in Texas.</p>\n    <p>X-Energy has said it hopes the reactor at a Dow site could be a blueprint for others and \"manufacturers worldwide could replicate this model\".</p>\n    <p>The government said the Hartlepool deal has the potential to power 1.5 million homes and create up to 2,500 jobs.</p>\n    <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Nuclear will power our homes with clean, homegrown energy and the private sector is building it in Britain, delivering growth and well-paid, skilled jobs for working people.\"</p>\n    <p>But Greenpeace questioned the UK's focus on nuclear power.</p>\n    <p>\"If these proposals for new reactors scattered around Britain really materialise, the net effect will be higher bills from nuclear's relentlessly spiralling costs, and more CO2 as we wait for the builders to overcome their inevitable construction delays,\" said Dr Douglas Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK.</p>\n    <p>The cost of building large nuclear plants in the UK, such as Sizewell C in Suffolk, has jumped to £38bn from a previous estimate of £20bn. Centrica is one of the key investors in Sizewell C.</p>\n    <p>SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity, but have around a third of the generating output.</p>\n    <p>The modular element means they could be built to order in factories - as a kit of parts - then transported and fitted together, like a flat-packed power station.</p>\n    <p>However, the SMR industry is still young, and many different designs are being investigated.</p>\n    <p>Centrica's chief executive Chris O'Shea told the BBC's Today programme that increased costs and delays \"can happen in all large projects\".</p>\n    <p>But he said: \"What you need to do is you need to do more than just one every 20 years in order to get better. So, the more you practice, the better you get which is why small and advanced modular reactors are particularly interesting because they'll be repetitive so you'll produce the same thing over and over again.</p>\n    <p>\"That should bring improvements both in terms of cost and schedule and reliability and cost as well.\"</p>\n    <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously said he wants the UK to return <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o\">to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\"</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.</p>\n    <p>In November 2024, the UK and 30 other countries signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgzevzwxwro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

in Washington, DC on 26 February 2025.\"/>\n    <p>Sir Keir Starmer is facing mounting pressure from within the Labour party over his handling of the sacking of the US ambassador Peter Mandelson.</p>\n    <p>Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership, as he prepares to welcome US President Donald Trump on a state visit this week.</p>\n    <p>Lord Mandelson was sacked last week after a cache of emails reported by Bloomberg showed supportive messages he sent after convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offences.</p>\n    <p>Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be \"gone\" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour.</p>\n    <p>The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's judgement and the wider Downing Street operation.</p>\n    <p>Burgon is a longstanding left-wing critic of Starmer's leadership but his comments nevertheless underline the scale of discontent within Labour.</p>\n    <p>Burgon said: \"I think it's inevitable that if May's elections go as people predict and the opinion polls predict, then I think Starmer will be gone at that time.</p>\n    <p>\"In terms of where we are now, it feels like we're years and years into an unpopular government rather than a year into a government that's just got rid of the Conservatives.</p>\n    <p>\"We're losing votes to the left, we're going to be losing seats to the right.\"</p>\n    <p>His words echoed a weekend of briefing by Labour MPs in public and in private questioning Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>Labour MP Helen Hayes told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour on Sunday that if the sacking were to affect the party's chances in the May 2026 local elections, there would be questions about Sir Keir's leadership.</p>\n    <p>\"Questions about the nature of the leadership and whether things can continue as they are, but we're not at that point now,\" she said.</p>\n    <p>Hayes added that she felt \"devastated\" about Lord Mandelson, but said she believed he should not have been appointed in the first place.</p>\n    <p>With Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month, Downing Street will be hoping to reset the agenda.</p>\n    <p>This week also marks the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgqe26jvnno\">first flight sending asylum seeker deportees to France</a> under the \"one-in-one-out\" deal signed in July.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street sources acknowledge that Sir Keir's upcoming Labour party conference speech must make an impact and say MPs would be \"left in no doubt what he stands for and what drives him\".</p>\n    <p>But this is the second week in a row the prime minister has begun by trying to draw a line under a scandal that led to a high profile exit, and move to a new chapter.</p>\n    <p>The mood in the parliamentary Labour party is bleak, and there are fears the past two weeks may have crystalised MPs' concerns.</p>\n    <p>Government minister Baroness Smith, who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, told the BBC in her experience \"there will always be people in the Labour party worried about us going further and faster\".</p>\n    <p>\"It is difficult at the moment given people's insecurity and concern sometimes for mainstream politicians to cut through.\"</p>\n    <p>She also hit back at Burgon's prediction that Sir Keir will be replaced next year, telling BBC Breakfast the backbencher had never supported the prime minister.</p>\n    <p>She admitted that the sacking of Lord Mandelson as the ambassador to the US was \"not what we would have wanted to happen in the run up to this week\", but said the PM was doing a good job.</p>\n    <p>The BBC reported on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn82rdmzr20o\">Sir Keir explicitly asked Mandelson</a> about his links to the paedophile before deciding to appoint him as ambassador to the US.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives have demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment.</p>\n    <p>In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.</p>\n    <p>He said that the scandal had exposed the PM's \"appalling judgement\".</p>\n    <p>\"He ignored warnings about Peter Mandelson's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, forced through his appointment, and is avoiding scrutiny about what he knew,\" Burghart wrote.</p>\n    <p>The Conservative MP's letter also demanded the release of what he called the \"Mandelson-Epstein Files\" - government correspondence and internal documents related to the pair - and for Sir Keir and his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney to give evidence to Parliament.</p>\n    <p>Downing Street have already stressed that the prime minister only knew the contents of the emails on Wednesday evening and acted swiftly, sacking Mandelson within hours.</p>\n    <p>Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has warned Sir Keir's leadership is \"hanging by a thread\" and demanded the prime minister explain Mandelson's appointment in parliament.</p>\n    <p>Labour is facing a polling challenge from Reform UK, as leader Nigel Farage claimed

Inflationary challenges are just tremendously challenging.</p>\n    <p>“[For consumers, grocery inflation] comes on top of bills elsewhere going up. Household groceries have become a bigger proportion of household income, without question.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley’s comments came as the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) significantly raised its forecast for food and drink inflation to hit 5.7% by the end of the year, up from a previous prediction of 4.8%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said the impact of April’s rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/packaging-waste-prepare-for-extended-producer-responsibility\">extended producer responsibility</a> for packaging had “rippled through to prices on the shelf edge”.</p>\n    <p>Last month, more than 60 retailers wrote to Reeves urging her to avoid implementing further taxes on the industry in the budget.</p>\n    <p>However, while acknowledging that there is “no doubt” the 26 November budget was injecting uncertainty into the market, he added that the importance of the festive tradition means that “when it comes to groceries and Xmas, British consumers always find a way to celebrate”.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said there was a trend for shoppers to increasingly focus on spending a little more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/12/upmarket-finest-range-helps-lift-tesco-sales-amid-uk-home-dining-boom\">on a home dining experience instead of going out</a>, with its premium own-label range recording 14% growth last year.</p>\n    <p>“We expect that trend to continue this Christmas,” he said. “Shoppers are prioritising value. There definitely is a trend we are seeing with customers treating themselves at home rather than going out.”</p>\n    <p>Hurley also said shoppers could face higher food prices if the government introduced further measures in the budget that increased costs for employers.</p>\n    <p>The warning came as the supermarket chain released annual results showing sales increased slightly to £18.1bn last year while profits fell more than a fifth.</p>\n    <p>“The government need to consider very carefully any measures that might inadvertently add to operating costs as there is a risk they could find their way into the food sector,” said Hurley.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The German discounter said its decline in profits – from £552.9m to £435.5m – was in part due to the budget chain’s spending in price promotions and raising pay for staff, as well as an intensive store opening programme.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said that Aldi spent £14bn with British suppliers last year – with more than 75% of sales coming from UK suppliers, manufacturers and producers – and called on the government to invest in the agriculture sector.</p>\n    <p>“We would also welcome investment in the British farming sector,” he said. “We know an investment in British agriculture can ensure our food sector is resilient and secure. So we don’t have to rely on what can be more volatile imports [that could ultimately impact prices in stores].”</p>\n    <p>Aldi said it intended to invest a further £1.6bn in the UK to open 80 new stores over the next two years. The retailer has 1,060 stores in the UK and Ireland, with plans to increase that to 1,500.</p>\n    <p>The discounter is snapping at the heels of Britain’s third-biggest supermarket, Asda, with figures out earlier this year from analysts Kantar showing it was just one percentage point behind in terms of market share – 10.8% v 12.1%.</p>\n    <p>Hurley said shoppers were “still finding things difficult”, which is why it was “laser focused” on keeping its prices low.</p>\n    <p>“We’re more determined than ever to meet that demand,” he said. “And that’s why we’re investing a record £1.6bn over the next two years, to bring Aldi prices closer to millions more customers.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/15/aldis-uk-boss-warns-shoppers-face-higher-food-prices-if-budget-heaps-extra-costs-on-retailers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The 12 Hartlepool reactors are expected to generate enough power for up to 1.5m homes.</p>\n    <p>Other ventures announced include plans by the US nuclear firm Holtec, EDF Energy and the property developer Tritax, for advanced datacentres powered by small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire, in an £11bn project.</p>\n    <p>Another US reactor company, Last Energy, is partnering with the port and P&amp;O Ferries owner DP World, to develop one of the world’s first micro modular nuclear power plants. It would supply the DP World’s London Gateway port and business park.</p>\n    <p>The government said more nuclear facilities were needed for clean homegrown power to ensure energy security, with the commercial deals after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/keir-starmer-unveils-plan-for-large-nuclear-expansion-across-england-and-wales\">Starmer’s announcement this year</a> of the biggest expansion of nuclear power in generations, and the eventual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment\">go-ahead for the new Sizewell C</a> station in Suffolk with billions in state funding.</p>\n    <p>Ministers also hope to attract major US tech investment in AI datacentres with the promise of abundant electricity to meet their huge power requirements.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-13\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>The US secretary of energy, Chris Wright, said the US was looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution”. He said: “Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”</p>\n    <p>The deals, he added, would “unleash commercial access in both the US and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening US energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”</p>\n    <p>Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the transatlantic deals would contribute to the sector’s “industrial revival, creating thousands of high-value jobs, and strengthening the UK’s energy security”.</p>\n    <p>As well as attempting to reduce broader reliance on overseas energy, the UK-US agreement – known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy – will look to eliminate any remaining dependency on Russian nuclear material by the end of 2028.</p>\n    <p>The deal will mean both countries fast-track reactor design checks by collaborating and accepting regulatory assessments from the other, avoiding duplicating bureaucracy.

They were followed by other Mediterranean countries including Spain, Italy and Portugal.</p>\n    <p>The economists from the University of Mannheim and the European Central Bank described the results as “conservative” because they did not account for the record-breaking wildfires that torched southern Europe last month or the compounding impact of extreme weather events that strike at the same time.</p>\n    <p>Sehrish Usman, an economist at the University of Mannheim and the lead author of the study, said the study’s “timely estimates” could help policymakers target support in the absence of official data. “The true costs of extreme weather surface slowly because these events aﬀect lives and livelihoods through a wide range of channels that extend beyond the initial impact.”</p>\n    <p>Scientists have raced to work out the extent to which global heating has worsened punishing weather extremes this summer, with studies suggesting climate breakdown made scorching fire weather <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/04/spain-portugal-wildfire-weather-climate-crisis-study\">40 times more likely</a> in Spain and Portugal, and <a href=\"https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/weather-conditions-leading-to-deadly-wildfires-in-turkiye-cyprus-and-greece-made-10-times-more-likely-due-to-climate-change/\">10 times more likely</a> in Greece and Turkey. The death toll from the “quietly devastating” June heatwave is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/09/europe-june-heatwave-study-climate-breakdown-tripled-death-toll\">tripled in 12 big cities</a> because of planet-heating pollution.</p>\n    <p>While most research into the economic costs of climate breakdown looks at direct impacts, such as destroyed assets or insured losses, the authors of the new study used historical relationships between violent weather and economic output to account for ripple effects, such the limited hours that builders can work during heatwaves or the disruption to commute times after floods damage railways.</p>\n    <p>Stéphane Hallegatte, the chief climate economist at the World Bank, who was not involved in the study, said it confirmed that the wider economic impacts of extreme weather were larger than the direct effects and last longer than people imagine.</p>\n    <p>“I’ve been arguing for a long time to shift our focus from the direct damages from disasters to broader metrics that capture a fuller economic impact, so I’m very happy to see the study doing exactly that,” he said.</p>\n    <p>But he warned that it used “imperfect proxies” to identify extreme weather, which would likely lead to underestimating the full costs. The GVA did not capture the full cost of extreme weather on people and firms, he added, or the benefits of reducing vulnerability.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-11\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>“Especially when disasters affect poor communities and people, the impact on GVA may be minimal, because these people are poor,” said Hallegatte. “But it does not mean they won’t suffer.”</p>\n    <p>Gert Bijnens, an economist at the National Bank of Belgium, who was not involved in the study, said supply chain disruption was one of the most significant “hidden costs” that usually went uncounted. A <a href=\"https://www.nbb.be/doc/ts/publications/wp/wp466en.pdf\">study he coauthored</a> on the costs of the devastating Belgian floods in 2021 found that sales at manufacturing firms far from the disaster fell sharply if they had long-standing suppliers in the flood zones.</p>\n    <p>Ignoring such effects could underestimate damages by as much as 30%, Bijnen said.</p>\n    <p>“Of course, such estimates come with uncertainty as they rely on historical averages and can’t yet fully capture compounding events,” he added. “But the big message is clear: extreme weather is already leaving a sizeable economic footprint, and the indirect effects can be just as damaging as the direct destruction.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/europes-summer-of-extreme-weather-caused-43bn-of-short-term-losses-analysis-finds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>\n      <strong>Listen to James read this article </strong>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.</p>\n<p>All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.</p>\n<p>This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception.</p>\n<p>There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real.</p>\n<p>And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.</p>\n<h2>How Windsor became 'Trumpton'</h2>\n<p>For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.</p>\n<p>Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.</p>\n<p>For Palace officials, attention to detail is all.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.</p>\n<p>It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p>\n<p>There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.</p>\n<p>\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider.</p>\n<p>\"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"</p>\n<p>Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".</p>\n<p>King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.</p>\n<p>Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.</p>\n<h2>'Pressure to make this massive'</h2>\n<p>So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.</p>\n<p>The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.</p>\n<p>\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.</p>\n<p>The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)</p>\n<p>For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.</p>\n<p>One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"</p>\n<p>Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"</p>\n<h2>The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests</h2>\n<p>Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world.</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"</p>\n<p>Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.</p>\n<p>They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong.</p>\n<p>\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"</p>\n<p>For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.</p>\n<h2>Serious business behind the pageantry</h2>\n<p>Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.</p>\n<p>Ministers hope to complete a deal to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yp5qzeer6o\">exclude UK steel</a> and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.</p>\n<p>The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.</p>\n<p>This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".</p>\n<p>All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.</p>\n<p>The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.</p>\n<p>\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.</p>\n<p>\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"</p>\n<p>Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.</p>\n<p>\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"</p>\n<h2>The Mandelson question</h2>\n<p>For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.</p>\n<p>The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.</p>\n<p>Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?</p>\n<p>Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.</p>\n<p>According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job.</p>\n<p>It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.</p>\n<p>Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw25w9841o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Not reducing it would be completely tone deaf to what’s happening in the global bond markets.”</p>\n    <p>Threadneedle Street intervened during the depths of the financial crisis to buy UK government bonds – aiming to crash borrowing costs close to zero – in a programme that was ultimately expanded up to reach £895bn in total.</p>\n    <p>The Bank is now winding down quantitative easing – a process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – and has shed about £100bn of bonds in the past year through active sales and allowing maturing debts not to be replaced.</p>\n    <p>It still has a portfolio worth about £560bn, having disposed of most of its holdings at a loss.</p>\n    <p>City investors widely expect the Bank to scale back its QT programme to about £70bn for the year ahead. However, this would involve maintaining active sales at current levels because fewer gilts are due to expire over the next 12 months.</p>\n    <p>Sushil Wadhwani, who was on the MPC between 1999 and 2002, called for a halt to active sales entirely amid worries over the impact of QT on the bond market.</p>\n    <p>“On monetary policy grounds, the Bank should switch to passive QT [only allowing maturing debt to expire],” he said. “Irrespective of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/andrew-bailey\">Andrew Bailey</a> says, the 30-year yield has a significant impact on confidence in the UK economy. I have foreign investors bring it up all the time.”</p>\n    <p>Scaling back the Bank’s QT programme could help the chancellor by easing some of the pressure on long-term gilt yields. Such a step would also save the Treasury money because Threadneedle Street has been selling its bonds at a loss.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-17\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Andrew Sentance, another former MPC member, said cutting the Bank’s QT programme to about £70bn was sensible because markets expected such a reduction. However, he warned Reeves against banking on any windfall.</p>\n    <p>“The job of the Bank is not to make the chancellor’s life easy. Its job is to control inflation. And a modest winding back on QT would be quite consistent with that.”</p>\n    <p>In a rare piece of upbeat news for the chancellor, a survey by trade body Make UK suggests an upturn in the key manufacturing sector in the third quarter, with output and export orders rising.</p>\n    <p>Make UK’s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said all the indicators in the survey, carried out by consultancy BDO, had improved.</p>\n    <p>“After a period of considerable uncertainty in global markets, these figures are an encouraging sign that manufacturers’ confidence is improving and, more importantly, being translated into growth and investment.</p>\n    <p>“However, one swallow doesn’t make a summer, and with UK and European markets in particular remaining anaemic it wouldn’t take much to knock prospects for further growth.”</p>\n    <p>The IPPR thinktank has estimated that halting active sales – matching the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank – could save the Treasury more than £10bn a year.</p>\n    <p>However, holding on to the bonds would not be cost free, because the Bank earns less interest on its gilt portfolio than it pays out on commercial bank reserves.</p>\n    <p>Last month, the IPPR called on Reeves to raise taxes on the country’s biggest banks amid windfall profits on their reserves parked at Threadneedle Street. Some economists have also called for the Bank to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/04/a-simple-solution-to-rachel-reeves-spending-cuts-stop-subsidising-the-banks\">pay lower rates of interest</a> on some commercial bank reserves.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/bank-of-england-urged-to-slow-bond-selling-plan-to-help-cut-record-uk-borrowing-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Prices are rising, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/august-us-jobs-report-explainer\">jobs growth</a> has stalled, uncertainty is everywhere and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets\">stock markets</a> have soared to record highs. Against this background a scary word last used in the 1970s is being uttered again: stagflation.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/LxXFM/2/\">GDP chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Stagflation is the term that describes “stagnant” growth combined with “inflation” of prices. It means that companies are producing and hiring less, but prices are still going up. It’s a scenario that some economists say can be worse than a recession.</p>\n    <p>The last time the US saw a period of prolonged stagflation was in the 1970s during the oil shock crisis. Higher oil prices caused inflation to rise, while unemployment rose as consumers cut back on spending.</p>\n    <p>For now, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a> isn’t experiencing stagflation, but recent data has shown it is edging closer to it.</p>\n    <p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs\">tariffs</a> were announced in the spring, official data initially suggested the economy was shaking them off. New jobs were being added to the economy at a stable pace, while inflation went down to 2.3% – the lowest it had been since 2021.</p>\n    <p>However, when new labor market data was released in August, it became clear that there had been an impact on hiring that had been slow to appear in the data. Initial job figures for May and June were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/jobs-report-july-trump-tariffs-trade-war\">revised down</a> by 258,000. While figures in July and August were slightly stronger, it was still a marked drop compared with earlier in the year.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, inflation started crawling back up in April. In August, the annualized inflation rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\">hit</a> 2.9%, the highest since January.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/wrFdZ/1/\">Inflation chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>Brett House, an economist at Columbia Business School, said that surveys of economists showed expectations of a recession for the year ahead was at a three-year low in January. Growth was expected to remain solid, and inflation was expected to continue easing.</p>\n    <p>“Both of those expectations have been turned around by the set of policies and their erratic implementation,” House said. “We’ve seen growth forecasts for the remainder of this year cut substantially, and we have seen inflation forecasts pushed up.”</p>\n    <p>In other words, the economy has both become more stagnant and inflationary – stagflation.</p>\n    <p>Economists are pointing to two policies coming out of the White House that are pushing the economy closer toward stagflation.</p>\n    <p>Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention\">crackdown on immigration</a> has cut down the number of available workers and also increased the cost of hiring. And when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs\">prices</a>, tariffs have just started to have a noticeable impact as companies pass tariff costs on to consumers.</p>\n    <p>Investors are banking on hopes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> cutting interest rates next week, but the future of the US economy remains uncertain.</p>\n    <p>In his closely watched speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">outlined</a> the “shifting balance of risks” that have appeared over the summer.</p>\n    <p>“While the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,” Powell said. Meanwhile, “higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods.”</p>\n    <p>Stagflation weakens the Fed’s ability to balance the economy. Adjusting interest rates can help balance out unemployment and inflation, but only if one is rising. When inflation surged to 9.1% in summer 2022, raising interest rates helped bring prices down. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">Inflation</a> went down to below 2.5%, but the unemployment rate went up in the meanwhile, from a low of 3.4% in 2023 to 4.3% this past August.</p>\n    <p>The Fed actually has more power during a recession, which economists broadly define as a period of slowed economic activity. When Covid lockdowns caused a recession, with massive unemployment, in 2020, the Fed lowered interest rates down to near zero to stimulate the economy.</p>\n    <p>Because we’re not seeing stagflation yet, the Fed moving rates down next week could help the labor market without causing prices to soar. But the move comes with uncertainty.</p>\n    <p>“Say stagflation is happening, but at a very slow pace, because firms are waiting to pass through [the cost of tariffs],” said Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, an economist at Brown University. “Firms are going to start seeing demand increase and say: ‘Oh, now I can pass through my higher costs on to more consumers.’ … Then we are going to see inflation.”</p>\n    <p>One <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trump-goldman-sachs-chief-david-solomon\">analysis</a> from Goldman Sachs said that US consumers had already absorbed 22% of the cost of tariffs, and that they could eventually take on 67% if current tariffs continue.</p>\n    <p>If prices continue to rise, and the labor market continues to slow, stagflation will get stronger.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eLKLy/1/\">jobs chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>“If [stagflation] happens, it’s a very depressive situation because people are going to lose their jobs, unemployment is going to increase and people who are looking for jobs are going to have a very hard time finding jobs. That’s going to be the hard part,” Kalemli-Ozcan said.</p>\n    <p>The Yale Budget Lab <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/effect-tariffs-poverty\">estimated</a> that Trump’s tariffs could increase the number of Americans living in poverty by at least 650,000 as tariffs become what the lab calls an “indirect tax”.</p>\n    <p>The Trump administration has urged Americans to be patient with the impacts of the tariffs and has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/trump-fires-erika-mcentarfer-labor-statistics\">claimed</a> that recent economic data has been “rigged” against the president.</p>\n    <p>“The real numbers that I’m talking about are going to be whatever it is, but will be in a year from now,” Trump said earlier this month. “You’re going to see job numbers like our country has never seen.”</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/13/stagflation-economy-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.355 against the US dollar this morning.</p>\n<p>The pound against the US dollar over the last 24 hours (timings in GMT) Photograph: LSEG</p>\n<p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, points out there is “not much to like” from the July monthly GDP update, with zero growth in the economy at the start of the third quarter.</p>\n<p>If the third quarter is not going to be a disaster for the UK economy, then growth in August and September will need to do the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>The pound is extending losses on this news and is eroding some of Thursday’s gains. For now, GBP/USD is hanging on to $1.3550, however, if bond yields start to rise on the back of this data, then we could see pound weakness later on Friday. The pound is the third worst performer in the G10 FX space so far today.</p>\n<p>The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget.</p>\n<p>It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>\n<p>GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half.</p>\n<p>The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing.</p>\n<p>The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy.</p>\n<p>A Treasury spokesperson said:</p>\n<p>“We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.”</p>\n<p>Oof! The London stock market has just closed, cementing a terrible day for Ocado.</p>\n<p>Ocado’s shares have ended the day down 19.9%, at 240p, as City investors react to the news that its US partner Kroger was considering a potential retreat from investment in automated warehouses.</p>\n<p>That knocks £500m off Ocado’s market value, as the company was worth just over £2.5bn at the start of the day.</p>\n<p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says:</p>\n<p>“It is hard to overstate how damaging this news is for Ocado. Kroger was one of the linchpins of its expansion strategy, and was a poster boy for the use of Ocado’s technology worldwide.</p>\n<p>Others may now follow suit. Sadly Ocado has been a losing proposition for most investors over the course of its life as a listed company, with only a brief period in 2013/14 and then from 2018-2021 really delivering the goods. Today’s news casts a dark shadow over the company and its long-suffering investors.”</p>\n<p>US consumer sentiment hit by worries about jobs and prices</p>\n<p>US consumer sentiment has fallen this month, as Americans worry about rising prices and a weakening jobs market.</p>\n<p>The University of Michican’s index of consumer morale has declined to 55.4 from 58.2 in August; according to Bloomberg that’s the lowest reading since May.</p>\n<p>Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu reports that sentiment about the economy fell particularly strongly among lower and middle income consumers, adding:</p>\n<p>Consumers continue to note multiple vulnerabilities in the economy, with rising risks to business conditions, labor markets, and inflation. Likewise, consumers perceive risks to their pocketbooks as well; current and expected personal finances both eased about 8% this month.</p>\n<p>Trade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month. Still, sentiment remains above April and May 2025 readings, immediately after the initial announcement of reciprocal tariffs.</p>\n<p>Consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell to an index value of 55.4 in September (est was 58.0), driven by a big decline in the future expectations component. pic.twitter.com/XCgxqRbaso</p>\n<p>Ocado shares slide after US partner warns on robotic warehouses</p>\n<p>Shares in Ocado have now slumped even deeper into the red – down a hefty 17% today.</p>\n<p>As flagged earlier, Ocado’s shares are under pressure after key customer Kroger, the US grocery giant, said it would undertake a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network. That has raised fears of weaker demand for its robotic warehouses.</p>\n<p>Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, comments:</p>\n<p>Kroger also said it was using stores ‘very heavily’ to fulfil e-commerce orders and implied that was its key focus from now on.</p>\n<p>“These comments imply that Ocado might find it harder to sell more automated solutions to Kroger, and that existing agreements might come under review. It’s the worst kind of news imaginable for Ocado investors as they’ve bought into a company which has positioned itself as the technology solution to grocery providers’ needs. While Ocado has continued to win new contracts, the pace has been erratic. The prospect of existing relationships starting to deteriorate adds another level of risk. Then there is the big question of when Ocado will ever make a sustainable profit.”</p>\n<p>The oil price has jumped today, as Russia faces more sanctions over the Ukraine war.</p>\n<p>This morning, the UK government implemented 100 new sanctions designed to hit Russia’s revenues and military supplies, including against its so-called shadow fleet carrying oil and electronics companies.</p>\n<p>US President Donald Trump has also threatened Moscow with new economic sanctions, saying that his patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin was “running out fast”.</p>\n<p>Trump told Fox News:</p>\n<p>“It’ll be hitting very hard on – with sanctions to banks and having to do with oil and tariffs also.”</p>\n<p>Brent crude is up almost 2% today, at $67.65 per barrel.</p>\n<p>A Ukranian drone attack on Russia’s northwestern port of Primorsk, which led to a suspension of oil loading operations overnight, is another factor.</p>\n<p>The UK economy could get a boost next week, during Donald Trump’s state visit.</p>\n<p>According to Bloomberg, the leaders of OpenAI and Nvidia plan to pledge support for billions of dollars in UK data centre investments when they head to the country next week, as part of Trump’s trip.</p>\n<p>SamAltman, the boss of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and chipmaker Nvidia’s chief executive JensenHuang are reportedly working with London-based data centre business NscaleGlobalHoldings on the project.

That would be slightly faster growth than the 0.3% recorded in the second quarter of this year.</p>\n<p>NIESR says:</p>\n<p>We expect GDP to grow by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, as we forecast better monthly growth outturns for August and September. However, elevated uncertainty among businesses and households continue to pose downside risks to this forecast.</p>\n<p>Fergus Jimenez-England, associate economist at NIESR, warns that economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments, adding:</p>\n<p>“Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the Chancellor this Autumn.”</p>\n<p>⚡️OUT NOW⚡️ Our latest #GDP Tracker expect #UKGDP to grow by 0.4% in the third quarter 📈</p>\n<p>Back in the financial markets, shares in Ocado have slumped by 12% on fears that one of its key customers could be pulling back from automation.</p>\n<p>Online grocery firm Ocado is the top faller on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after US supermarket chain Kroger said it plans to conduct a site-by-site analysis of its automated fulfilment network.</p>\n<p>This suggests Ocado might struggle to sell more automated solutions to Kroger, who has been an important customer in the past.</p>\n<p>Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets, explains:</p>\n<p>Last night on its earnings call, the US retailer, which is Ocado’s biggest partner for its warehouse automation technology, said it would take a “hard look” at some of its automated facilities and carry out a “full site-by-site analysis” of its existing network.</p>\n<p>The comments are clearly a negative for Ocado as Kroger seems likely to move away from the kind of large CFCs provided by the British company and instead seems to be looking to lean on local stores to fill orders.</p>\n<p>Back in 2018, Ocado’s shares soared after it announced a deal to provide its technology to Kroger – a breakthrough in its push to licence its services to grocers around the world.</p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/12/uk-gdp-report-economy-july-tariffs-inflation-consumer-confidence-business-live\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Most economists had anticipated a slowdown after Britain recorded the strongest growth in the G7 in the first half of the year.</p>\n    <p>Manufacturers and exporters had rushed to beat the introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs early in 2025. However, with US stockpiles now filled, and global uncertainty weighing on industry, new orders have slumped – reflected by a 1.1% plunge in manufacturing output in July.</p>\n    <p>Tax changes this spring had also pulled forward activity in the property market and influenced car sales, leading to more monthly volatility in the GDP numbers.</p>\n    <p>Households are under pressure from rising inflation. Consumer-facing services recorded no growth in July, despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/retail-sales-rise-but-ons-apologises-as-statistics-crisis-deepens\">decent month for retailers as hot weather and England winning the Euro 2025</a> women’s football tournament helped to lift sales. But, taken together over the past three months, spending was in the doldrums, with a 0.6% slump in consumer-facing services.</p>\n    <p>The government also blames years of underinvestment under the Conservatives. But while it is evident that the economy has lacked a cash injection in recent years, there are also signs Reeves has added to the UK’s headwinds.</p>\n    <p>Economists highlight the damage to businesses and jobs from the chancellor’s first autumn budget. Reeves’s £25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) in particular has been blamed for hitting hiring demand and sapping investment.</p>\n    <p>As the chancellor prepares for her second budget on 26 November, the challenge is considerable: growth is weak, yet tax increases or spending cuts could be required to cover an anticipated shortfall in the government finances.</p>\n    <p>Business leaders warn that any further tax rises would add to the considerable headwinds facing the economy, by sapping investment and hitting consumer spending. Government spending cuts would be hugely politically damaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/uk-hit-by-fresh-sell-off-in-government-bond-markets-as-pound-weakens\">Bond market investors</a> are watching closely.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-12\">skip past newsletter promotion</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>after newsletter promotion</p>\n    <p>Among the big concerns is that speculation over the tax changes in the budget will dampen business activity over the coming months, even before November arrives, in a carbon copy of Labour’s first months back in office last year.</p>\n    <p>Meanwhile, the global backdrop remains challenging as Trump’s tariff policies weigh on international trade. Household finances in the UK are being squeezed afresh by elevated inflation, while pay growth is slowing – hitting consumer spending power.</p>\n    <p>On the more positive side, growth is clearly under pressure but is not collapsing. The latest snapshot of private sector business activity from the monthly services PMI suggested August was a robust month. Most economists – including those at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/29/imf-global-growth-forecast-trump-tariffs-eu-trade-us\">International Monetary Fund</a> – anticipate growth this year of just over 1%. While historically weak, it is growth all the same despite the challenges.</p>\n    <p>Politically, however, a message that the economy is just about muddling through is hardly helpful. For the chancellor it will be a high-stakes challenge to unstick the British economy.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/12/stagnant-gdp-shows-scale-of-challenge-for-rachel-reeves-at-autumn-budget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>In the UK, the owner of John Lewis and Waitrose has said its losses nearly tripled to £88m in the first half of this year, as it took a hit from restructuring costs as well as new tax and regulatory charges.</p>\n<p>John Lewis Partnership, which operates 36 department stores and more than 300 Waitrose supermarkets, said new packaging regulations and increased national insurance contributions had cost it £29m, while it spent £54m on restructuring its business, mainly on replacing outdated technology.</p>\n<p>As a result, the employee-owned group’s half year pre-tax losses widened from £30m over the same period a year before, despite a 4% rise in sales to £6.2bn in the six months to 26 July.</p>\n<p>Wall Street’s main indexes have opened higher, despite today’s data showing a jump in unemployment claims and consumer prices.</p>\n<p>Rather than worrying about the state of the labor market, traders seem to be betting that the USFederalReserve is on track to cut interest rates next week.</p>\n<p>The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 218 points, or 0.5%, in early trading to 45,708 points.</p>\n<p>The broader S&amp;P 500 index is 0.25% higher.</p>\n<p>Analysts at ING agree that the Fed’s focus is now the jobs market.</p>\n<p>James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist, explains:</p>\n<p>Inflation was a touch higher than expected and tariffs are likely to keep it elevated over coming months, but the the weakening of the jobs market is now the Fed’s priority, with rising jobless claims hinting at a pick-up in lay-offs at a time when hiring is subdued</p>\n<p>The number of initial claims (a proxy for layoffs) in Texas almost doubled in the week to 6 September, to 31,908 from 16,604 in the previous seven days.</p>\n<p>There was also an increase of 2,980 in Michigan, but many other states recorded a drop in claims (before seasonal adjustments).</p>\n<p>Bloomberg economist Eliza Winger says:</p>\n<p>The surge in initial jobless claims in the first week of September came primarily from Texas, while claims declined in most states. While any deterioration in the labor market bears watching given growing labor-market weakness, a broader increase in claims would have been much more concerning.”</p>\n<p>Experts: Fed likely to cut rates to help weak jobs market</p>\n<p>The jump in US jobless claims last week, and the pick-up in inflation in August, are a worrying sign for America’s economy.</p>\n<p>Together, they paint a picture of an economy losing jobs, as consumers are hit by rising prices in the shops, as tariffs are passed onto consumers.</p>\n<p>Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank, explains:</p>\n<p>“The August CPI inflation report was a hot one, no matter how you slice or dice it. President Donald Trump’s inflationary policies – tariffs and restrictive immigration measures – are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers’ purchasing power. Although inflation came in hotter than expected, the Fed is likely to prioritise signs of labour market weakness for now.</p>\n<p>“Supporting this view, initial jobless claims data – released at the same time as the CPI report – showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits jumping to 263k in the week of 6th September, up from 237,000 the week prior, which is the fastest pace of increase since October 2024 and the highest level since October 2021.</p>\n<p>This reinforces the Fed’s view of an increasingly fragile labour market. Markets placed more weight on the weak jobless claims data than on the hot August inflation print – a leading to a drop in 2-year and 10-year yields, and traders fully pricing in three rate cuts this year.”</p>\n<p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, agrees that the Fed should prioritise the ‘weak’ jobs market, saying:</p>\n<p>While a 2.9% CPI rate is not exactly dovish, the lack of feed through from tariffs into the CPI report could ease Fed concerns about the future path of inflation. Added to this, there was more weakness in the US labour market. Initial jobless claims jumped from 236k to 265k last week, which is one of the highest levels over the last 4 years.</p>\n<p>This supports the view that the Fed should be focused on the deterioration in the labour market rather than inflation risks, and it supports a 50bp rate cut, in our view.</p>\n<p>New US unemployment claims hit near four-year high</p>\n<p>Ouch!

Core CPI, which excludes energy and food costs, stayed stable at 3.1% after going up in July.</p>\n    <p>Despite this slight uptick in inflation, Wall Street remains optimistic that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> will cut interest rates at the central bank’s board meeting next week. The Fed is under intense pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> to cut rates, but the decision looks likely to be led by fears that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025\">US jobs market is weakening</a>.</p>\n    <p>Investors are anticipating a quarter-point rate cut. Rates currently stand at a range of 4.25% to 5.5%.</p>\n    <p>US stocks shot up on Wednesday after the producer price index, which tracks wholesale prices, showed a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/10/ppi-inflation-august-2025-.html\">slight dip</a> in August after a steep rise in July, making investors hopeful that inflation – while still rising – is going up at a slow pace.</p>\n    <p>\n      <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/7pYlh/1/\">latest inflation chart</a>\n    </p>\n    <p>The Fed has refrained from cutting rates over the past year, citing instability in the economy introduced by federal immigration and trade policies. The central bank has been on a years-long mission to bring inflation down to a target of 2%, a level that has not been seen since early 2021. Higher interest rates help temper rising costs, but at the risk of slowing other parts of the economy, including the labor market.</p>\n    <p>At his closely watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/22/jerome-powell-speech-jackson-hole\">speech</a> at the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium last month, its chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell\">Jerome Powell</a>, said that recent economic circumstances “may warrant adjusting our policy stance”, which many investors took as a signal that the Fed will drop rates.</p>\n    <p>Powell said that while tariffs had started pushing prices up, with no clear end, a slowdown in the jobs market had caught the attention of the Fed. Powell said that the “downside risks to employment are rising”.</p>\n    <p>“If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” Powell said.</p>\n    <p>Data released in early August painted a concerning picture of the labor market, as initial jobs figures for May and June were revised down by a total of 258,000. The White House quickly blamed the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the government agency that collects and reports employment data, for the gaps. But economists pointed out that uncertainty introduced by Trump’s tariffs probably caused delays in survey collection.</p>\n    <p>Last week, the BLS revised down figures from June again, and the number of jobs added to the economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs\">went into the negative</a> for the first time since December 2020. The unemployment rate also went slightly up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021.</p>\n    <p>The Fed is scheduled to announce any changes to the interest on 17 September.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/11/us-inflation-august-trump-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
