Fans will be able to assemble rosters, speculate on rising talent, and earn rewards tied to their predictions and engagement.</p>\n    <p>“The way fans value and perceive players should be different than owners and news networks,” Teherany said in an interview with CoinDesk. “We’re trying to give power back to the fan — not just to predict who they think is great, but to actually earn incentives from it. Imagine being able to prove that the fan consensus on a rookie’s potential is more accurate than a team’s front office.”</p>\n    <p>Teherany stressed that the app won’t launch with a native token, distancing itself from projects like Socios that hinge on token price. Instead, players will hold in-app value that reflects fan sentiment and game outcomes.</p>\n    <h3>Why Somnia, Not Solana?</h3>\n    <p>Asked why the team chose to build on Somnia instead of more established chains like Solana or Avalanche, Teherany pointed to both relationships and philosophy.</p>\n    <p>“Everything in this industry comes from authentic relationships,” he said. “When we met Herman Narula, it was an alignment of vision. He’s not chasing short-term token hype but is committed to building sports and entertainment on-chain for the long term. That gave us confidence that this wouldn’t just be valued on market speculation.”</p>\n    <p>The decision also came after lessons learned from a previous project, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tracyai-by-virtuals\">TracyAI</a>, which Teherany said became too dependent on token performance. This time, the focus is on infrastructure, gamification, and sustainability.</p>\n    <h3>Somnia’s Technical Edge</h3>\n    <p>Somnia went live on Sep. 2, following a six-month testnet that processed over 10 billion transactions and onboarded 118 million wallets. Backed by UK-based metaverse company Improbable, the network is positioning itself as the fastest EVM-compatible chain, claiming to handle more than one million transactions per second with sub-second finality.</p>\n    <p>At launch, Somnia <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/02/somnia-mainnet-goes-live-along-with-native-somi-token-after-10b-testnet-transactions\">onboarded 60 validators</a>, including Google Cloud, and has integrated with protocols like LayerZero, Sequence, and Thirdweb. Its native token, SOMI, has nearly doubled in value since launch and is already processing billions in daily volume.</p>\n    <p>For Teherany, Somnia’s traction adds credibility: “They’ve done billions in daily volume, bigger than some of the major exchanges. That’s a testament to what they’re building—and what we’re building on top of it.”</p>\n    <h3>Road to Tip-Off</h3>\n    <p>The project’s first major reveal is scheduled for Korea Blockchain Week, where Thompson will share his vision alongside Narula and Teherany.

Instead, it will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives.</p>\n    <p>While XRPR is structured to hold XRP directly, it will also invest in spot ETFs from outside the U.S. to achieve exposure, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart <a href=\"https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1967639995365331251\">wrote</a> on X.</p>\n    <p>XRP, the native token of the financial institutional payments-focused network XRP Ledger, and memecoin DOGE are the third-largest and eighth largest crypto tokens by market cap, according to CoinDesk data.</p>\n    <p>Spot crypto ETFs debuted in the US. in January 2024 after many years of rejections and delays by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin\"/> funds were approved first, followed a few months later by ETFs offering spot exposure to ether (ETH).</p>\n    <p>Buying shares of ETFs offers exposure to assets without having to take ownership of the underlying asset themselves. As such, crypto ETFs offer a means of direct exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to worry about storage, custody and so on, making them a more practical and secure means of investment for deep-pocketed institutional investors.</p>\n    <p>Meer voor jou</p>\n    <p>Chainlink's LINK Surges 6% on Treasury Purchase, ETF Anticipation</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F417143387146cde8642cb8b429d4936be907e4f3-700x430.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75\" alt=\"&quot;Cryptocurrency LINK price chart showing a 6% increase to $24.49 with strong support at $22.82 and high trading volumes amid geopolitical and institutional factors.&quot;\"/>\n    <p>Caliber bought $6.5 million in tokens as part of its digital asset treasury strategy, while the Chainlink Reserve's token buybacks near $8 million since last month.</p>\n    <p>Wat u moet weten:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Chainlink's native token surged 6% to over $24.5 as altcoins led crypto markets higher in anticipation of spot-based ETFs entering the market soon.</li>\n      <li>Caliber purchased $6.5 million worth of LINK tokens as part of its digital asset strategy, while the Chainlink Reserve bought another $1 million tokens.</li>\n      <li>LINK is gaining momentum with multiple resistance levels breached, CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model said.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/18/etfs-offering-exposure-to-xrp-doge-debut-in-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Ethereum and Solana already dominate stablecoin volumes, while newer chains continue to optimize for similar flows. Plasma’s bet is that its architecture, dubbed PlasmaBFT, will give it an edge. The system is designed for fast, composable stablecoin transactions the team said, and from launch, users will be able to move USDT with zero fees through Plasma’s dashboard — a feature the team hopes will stand out in a crowded DeFi landscape.</p>\n    <p>Token distribution is also aimed at broad accessibility. Prior to launch, 10% of XPL was sold in a public offering. At launch, 25 million tokens will be allocated to the community, with another 2.5 million reserved for members of the so-called Stablecoin Collective.</p>\n    <p>Backing <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/13/plasma-raises-usd20m-to-develop-bitcoin-based-network-for-stablecoins\">the project are heavyweights</a> from the crypto and venture worlds: the $24 million in seed and Series A funding was led by Framework Ventures, with participation from Bitfinex, Peter Thiel and Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, among others.</p>\n    <p>“Plasma’s mission is to become the foundation for global money movement.
