Two former leaders of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25vDjs0iy_k\">explained the reasons for their sudden departures from the agency</a> in a Senate hearing. And they described how CDC employees are being instructed to turn their backs on scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>The CDC’s former director Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Debra Houry took questions from a Senate committee on Wednesday. <strong>They painted a picture of a health agency in turmoil—and at risk of harming the people it is meant to serve.</strong></p>\n<p>On Thursday, an advisory CDC panel that develops vaccine guidance met for a two-day discussion on multiple childhood vaccines. During the meeting, which was underway as <i>The Checkup</i> went to press, members of the panel were set to discuss those vaccines and propose recommendations on their use.</p>\n<p>Monarez worries that access to childhood vaccines is under threat—and that the public health consequences could be dire. “If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the current secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees federal health and science agencies that include the CDC, which monitors and responds to threats to public health. Part of that role involves developing vaccine recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>As  we’ve noted before, RFK Jr. has long been a prominent critic of vaccines.</strong> He has incorrectly linked commonly used ingredients to autism and made other incorrect statements about risks associated with various vaccines.</p>\n<p>Still, he oversaw the recruitment of Monarez—who does not share those beliefs—to lead the agency. When she was sworn in on July 31, Monarez, who is a microbiologist and immunologist, had already been serving as acting director of the agency. She had held prominent positions at other federal agencies and departments too, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-secretary-kennedy-swears-in-susan-monarez-as-cdc-director-to-advance-make-america-healthy-again.html\">described her as “a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials.”</a></p>\n<p><strong>His opinion seems to have changed somewhat since then. </strong>Just 29 days after Monarez took on her position, she was turfed out of the agency. And in yesterday’s hearing, she explained why.</p>\n<p>On August 25, Kennedy asked Monarez to do two things, she said. First, he wanted her to commit to firing scientists at the agency. And second, he wanted her to “pre-commit” to approve vaccine recommendations made by the agency’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), regardless of whether there was any scientific evidence to support those recommendations, she said. “He just wanted blanket approval,” she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk\">said during her testimony</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>She refused both requests.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Monarez testified that she didn’t want to get rid of hardworking scientists who played an important role in keeping Americans safe. And she said she could not commit to approving vaccine recommendations without reviewing the scientific evidence behind them and maintain her integrity. She was sacked.</p>\n<p>Those vaccine recommendations are currently under discussion, and scientists like Monarez are worried about how they might change. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the previous committee in June. (Monarez said she was not consulted on the firings and found out about them through media reports.)</p>\n<p><strong>“A clean sweep is needed to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy wrote in  a piece for the </strong>He went on to replace those individuals with eight new members, some of whom have been prominent vaccine critics and </p>\n<p><i>Wall Street Journal</i>at the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76#xd_co_f=OGFkNmQ3ZjItZGE1Ny00ODBiLThjNjktMWM5MzUwOTMyYTA0~\">have spread misinformation about vaccines</a>.

    "body": "\n  \n    <p>The chemical industry relies on hydrogen, which is typically made using fossil fuels today.Getty Images</p>\n    <p>Hydrogen is sometimes held up as a master key for the energy transition. It can be made using several low-emissions methods and could play a role in cleaning up industries ranging from agriculture and chemicals to aviation and long-distance shipping.</p>\n    <p>This moment is a complicated one for the green fuel, though, as a new report from the International Energy Agency lays out. A number of major projects face cancellations and delays, especially in the US and Europe. The US in particular is seeing a slowdown after changes to key tax credits and cuts in support for renewable energy. Still, there are bright spots for the industry, including in China, and new markets could soon become crucial for growth.</p>\n    <p>Here are three things to know about the state of hydrogen in 2025.</p>\n    <p>1. Expectations for annual clean hydrogen production by 2030 are shrinking, for the first time.</p>\n    <p>While hydrogen has the potential to serve as a clean fuel, today most is made with processes that use fossil fuels. As of 2025, about a million metric tons of low-emissions hydrogen are produced annually. That’s less than 1% of total hydrogen production.</p>\n    <p>In last year’s Global Hydrogen Report, the IEA projected that global production of low-emissions hydrogen would grow to as high as 49 million metric tons annually by 2030. That prediction has been steadily climbing since 2021, as more places around the world sink money into developing and scaling up the technology.</p>\n    <p>In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA’s production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.</p>\n    <p>That’s still a major expansion from today’s numbers, but it’s the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia.</p>\n    <p>2. China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world’s electrolyzers.</p>\n    <p>A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.</p>\n    <p>But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it’s roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that’s cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>3. Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.</p>\n    <p>There’s an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.</p>\n    <p>International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there’s been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.</p>\n    <p>Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.</p>\n    <p>Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we’ve seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.</p>\n    <p>This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

Now the same technology can compose a working genome.</p>\n<p>A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses—and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.</p>\n<p>The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the “the first generative design of complete genomes.”</p>\n<p>The work, described in a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675911v1\">preprint paper</a>, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an “impressive first step” toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by <i>MIT Technology Review</i>.  </p>\n<p>Boeke says the AI’s performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. “They saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,” he says.</p>\n<p>This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That’s because viruses are not alive. They’re more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes.</p>\n<p>In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria—called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters.</p>\n<p>To do so, they used two versions of an <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/generative-ai-tool-marks-a-milestone-in-biology\">AI called Evo</a>, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses.</p>\n<p>But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with <i>E. coli</i> bacteria.</p>\n<p>That led to a profound “AI is here” moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.</p>\n<p>“That was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,” says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out.</p>\n<p>Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working—that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them.</p>\n<p>J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/08/25/200992/how-to-remake-life/\">organisms with lab-made DNA</a> nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”</p>\n<p>For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. “We did the manual AI version—combing through the literature, taking what was known,” he says.</p>\n<p>But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\">claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024</a> for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses<strong>. </strong>For instance, doctors have sometimes tried “phage therapy” to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria.</p>\n<p>“There is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,” says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei’s lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients’ bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones.</p>\n<p>The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven’t taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists—out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice—could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality.</p>\n<p>“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it’s random so you don’t know what you are getting,” says Venter. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123801/ai-virus-bacteriophage-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multi-Agent Systems: The Next Frontier in AI-Driven Cyber Defense<br>\nImage by Editor | ChatGPT<br></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The increasing sophistication of cyber threats calls for a systemic change in the way we defend ourselves against them. Traditional security solutions, and legacy solutions, function in silos, and often struggle with dynamic and coordinated attacks. Multi-agent systems (MAS), on the other hand, utilize collaboration and agent dependent solutions, which enable a combination of AI agents to work together, mimicking human collaboration, as a “system”, while providing machine speed and scale when enhancing the cybersecurity posture of an organization.</p>\n<h2>The Power of Decentralized, Collaborative AI</h2>\n<p>At the heart of a MAS are many intelligent agents that act together, where agents are software entities capable of autonomous actions. In cyber security, the agents in a multi-agent system are intelligent systems that can observe their environments, arbitrate optimal actions, and act collectively to collaboratively detect, respond and respectively reduce cyber threat risk. AI agents are special because they can dynamically analyze new data or context from their investigations and autonomously adapt their actions based on similarities and growth, as they can presumably synthesised large amounts of information across multiple domains and generally develop from experimentation.</p>\n<p>The main advantages of using MAS in cybersecurity include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: Agents can be added or removed at will and, because of this, MAS can be more easily scaled to a diverse range of network sizes and complexities from small businesses to huge enterprises\n</li><li>Adaptability: Agents adapt to new data points, in that they can learn and adjust their algorithms for detection and response, they can adapt to new data without human intervention, allowing organizations to have a strong (proactive) defence against threats which evolve\n</li><li>Fault Tolerant: Failures in one agent do not prevent other agents from operating leading to guaranteed continued protection and resilience\n</li><li>Collaboration: Agents share information and coordinate responses, resulting in faster mitigation, fewer false positives, and a larger understanding of the threat landscape and increased situational awareness\n</li></ul>\n<h2>Practical Applications in Cyber Defense</h2>\n<p>Multi-Agent Systems are already revolutionizing security operations in several key areas:</p>\n<h3>Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS)</h3>\n<p>Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) typically offer a centralized approach to analysis, which can lead to latencies, or possible delays. With MAS, DIDS allow agents to monitor their own slice of the network in isolation, but share information to make sense of how seemingly coordinated attacks across multiple network segments occurred. For example, one agent may identify suspicious traffic patterns around a server, while another agent may relate this suspicious activity to anomalous user logins on a different endpoint, which collectively points to a multi-stage attack.</p>\n<h3>Automated Incident Response</h3>\n<p>MAS has the potential to automate complex incident response processes, and potentially prevent delays in incident response by allowing agents to perform the appropriate response tasks without the need for human intervention. Agents can be assigned to isolate infected machines, block suspicious IP’s, quarantine files, or roll back compromised configurations. This capability can reduce incident response time to minutes; ultimately preventing an attacker from harming even more systems. For example, an AI agent may identify a malware, analyze it, identify how it propagates, and could easily instruct agents to block its network connections, quarantine affected machines, etc.</p>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Sharing</h3>\n<p>Agents in an MAS environment can also use communication and real-time threat intelligence from other agents that are leveraging external databases, threat intelligence platforms or other MAS deployments. It has collective defense capabilities which enhances an organizations’ capabilities to spot, understand, and defend against current or emerging threats while they are still forming into attacks by creating a “common picture” of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>\n<h3>Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)</h3>\n<p>The multifaceted nature of multi-cloud environments poses enormous challenges for security teams. AI agents may be able to assess the context of alerts produced by CSPM tools and prioritize high-risk misconfigurations, and in some cases, autonomously remediate the issues by updating infrastructure-as-code or raising a pull request for the human user. AI agents can also understand the correlation of data across multiple cloud providers and offer a coherent and unified security posture.</p>\n<h3>The Human-Agent Collaboration</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-agent-systems-the-next-frontier-in-ai-driven-cyber-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">ROC AUC vs Precision-Recall for Imbalanced Data<br>\nImage by Editor | ChatGPT<br></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>When building machine learning models to classify <strong>imbalanced data</strong> — i.e. datasets where the presence of one class (like spam email for example) is much less frequent than the presence of the other class (non-spam email, for instance) — certain traditional metrics like accuracy or even the <strong>ROC AUC</strong> (Receiving Operating Characteristic curve and the area under it) may not reflect the model performance in realistic terms, giving overly optimistic estimates due to the dominance of the so-called negative class.</p>\n<p><strong>Precision-recall curves</strong> (or PR curves for short), on the other hand, are designed to focus specifically on the positive, typically rarer class, which is a much more informative measure for skewed datasets due to class imbalance.</p>\n<p>Through a discussion and three practical example scenarios, this article provides a comparison between ROC AUC and PR AUC — the area under both curves, taking values between 0 and 1 — across three imbalanced datasets, by training and evaluating a simple classifier based on logistic regression.</p>\n<h2>ROC AUC vs Precision-Recall</h2>\n<p>The ROC curve is the go-to approach to evaluate a classifier’s ability to discriminate between classes, namely by plotting the TPR (True Positive Rate, also called recall) against the FPR (False Positive Rate) for different thresholds for the probability of belonging to the positive class. Meanwhile, the precision-recall (PR) curve plots precision against recall for different thresholds, focusing on analyzing performance for positive class predictions. Therefore, it is particularly useful and informative for comprehensively evaluating classifiers trained on imbalanced datasets. The ROC curve, on the other hand, is less sensitive to class imbalance, being more suitable for evaluating classifiers built on rather balanced datasets, as well as in scenarios where the real-world cost of false positive and false negative predictions is similar.</p>\n<p>In sum, back to the PR curve and class imbalance datasets, in high-stakes scenarios where correctly identifying positive-class instances is crucial (e.g. identifying the presence of a disease in a patient), the PR curve is a more reliable measure of the classifier’s performance. </p>\n<p>On a more visual note, if we plot both curves alongside each other, we should get an increasing curve in the case of ROC and a decreasing curve in the case of PR. The closer the ROC curve gets to the (0,1) point, meaning the highest TPR and the lowest FPR, the better; whereas the closer the PR curve gets to the (1,1) point, meaning both precision and recall are at their maximum, the better. In both bases, getting closer to these “perfect model points” means the area under the curve or AUC becomes maximum: this is the numerical value we will seek in the examples that follow.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example ROC curve and precision-recall curve<br>\nImage by Author<br></p>\n<p>To illustrate the use and comparison between ROC AUC and precision-recall (PR curve for short), we will consider three datasets with different levels of class imbalance: from mildly to highly imbalanced.

One of the most well-established validation approaches is <strong>cross-validation</strong>, which splits the dataset into several subsets, called folds, and iteratively trains on some of them while testing on the rest. While scikit-learn offers standard components and functions to perform cross-validation the traditional way, several additional tricks can make the process more efficient, insightful, or flexible.</p>\n<p>This article reveals seven of these tricks, along with code examples of their implementation. The code examples below use the scikit-learn library, so make sure it is imported.</p>\n<p>I recommend that you first acquaint yourself with the basics of cross-validation by checking out <a href=\"https://www.statology.org/complete-guide-cross-validation/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>. Also, for a quick refresher, a basic cross-validation implementation (no tricks yet!) in scikit-learn would look like this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">datasets </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">load_iris</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-2\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-3\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">linear_model </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-i\">LogisticRegression</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-4\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-5\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">load_iris</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">return_X_y</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-t\">True</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-6\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-7\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">LogisticRegression</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">max_iter</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">200</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-8\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-9\"><span class=\"crayon-p\"># Basic cross-validation strategy with k=5 folds</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-10\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-11\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-12\"><span class=\"crayon-p\"># Cross validation results: per iteration + aggregated</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-13\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">print</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"Cross-validation scores:\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-14\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">print</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"Mean score:\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">mean</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following examples assume that the basic libraries and functions, like <code>cross_val_score</code>, have already been imported.</p>\n<h2>1.

Shuffled K-fold for Robust Splits</h2>\n<p>By using a <code>KFold</code> object along with the <code>shuffle=True</code> option, we can shuffle instances in the dataset to create more robust splits, thereby preventing accidental bias, especially if the dataset is ordered according to some criterion or the instances are grouped by class label, time, season, etc. It is very simple to apply this strategy:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">KFold</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">KFold</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">n_splits</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">shuffle</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-t\">True</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">random_state</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">42</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-4\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3.

Simply assign <code>n_jobs=-1</code> to run the process at the fold level on all available CPU cores. This can result in a significant speed boost, especially when the dataset is large.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca388985696570-1\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">n_jobs</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">-</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">1</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Cross-Validated Predictions</h2>\n<p>By default, using cross-validation in scikit-learn yields the accuracy scores per fold, which are then aggregated into the overall score. If instead we wanted to get predictions for every instance to later build a confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc., we can use <code>cross_val_predict</code> as a substitute for <code>cross_val_score</code>, as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_predict</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">y_pred</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_predict</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Beyond Accuracy: Custom Scoring</h2>\n<p>It is also possible to replace the default accuracy metric used in cross-validation with other metrics like recall or F1-score. It all depends on the nature of your dataset and your predictive problem’s needs. The <code>make_scorer()</code> function, along with the specific metric (which must also be imported), achieves this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">metrics </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">make_scorer</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">recall_score</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">make_scorer</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">average</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"macro\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-p\"># You can use recall_score too</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-4\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scoring</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Leave One Out (LOO) Cross-Validation</h2>\n<p>This strategy is essentially k-fold cross-validation taken to the extreme, providing an exhaustive evaluation for very small datasets. It is a useful strategy mostly for building simpler models on small datasets like the iris one we showed at the beginning of this article, and is generally not advisable for larger datasets or complex models like ensembles, mainly due to the computational cost.

This evolution has enabled them to solve increasingly difficult problems effectively.</p>\n<p>One of the mechanisms that has proven especially influential in the advancement of neural network-based models is <strong>batch normalization</strong>. This article provides a gentle introduction to this strategy, which has become a standard in many modern architectures, helping to improve model performance by stabilizing training, speeding up convergence, and more.</p>\n<h2>How and Why Batch Normalization Was Born?</h2>\n<p>Batch normalization is roughly 10 years old. It was originally proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy in their paper <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167\" target=\"_blank\">Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The motivation for its creation stemmed from several challenges, including slow training processes and saturation issues like exploding and vanishing gradients. One particular challenge highlighted in the original paper is <strong>internal covariate shift</strong>: in simple terms, this issue is related to how the distribution of inputs to each layer of neurons keeps changing during training iterations, largely because the learnable parameters (connection weights) in the previous layers are naturally being updated during the entire training process. These distribution shifts might trigger a sort of “chicken and egg” problem, as they force the network to keep readjusting itself, sometimes leading to unduly slow and unstable training.</p>\n<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>\n<p>In response to the aforementioned issue, <strong>batch normalization</strong> was proposed as a method that<strong> normalizes the inputs to layers</strong> in a neural network, helping stabilize the training process as it progresses.</p>\n<p>In practice, batch normalization entails introducing an additional normalization step before the assigned activation function is applied to weighted inputs in such layers, as shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">How Batch Normalization Works<br>\nImage by Author<br></p>\n<p>In its simplest form, the mechanism consists of <strong>zero-centering, scaling, and shifting the inputs</strong> so that values stay within a more consistent range. This simple idea helps the model learn an optimal scale and mean for inputs at the layer level. Consequently, gradients that flow backward to update weights during backpropagation do so more smoothly, reducing side effects like sensitivity to the weight initialization method, e.g., He initialization. And most importantly, this mechanism has proven to facilitate faster and more reliable training.</p>\n<p>At this point, two typical questions may arise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Why the “batch” in batch normalization?</strong>: If you are fairly familiar with the basics of training neural networks, you may know that the training set is partitioned into mini-batches — typically containing 32 or 64 instances each — to speed up and scale the optimization process underlying training. Thus, the technique is so named because the mean and variance used for normalization of weighted inputs are not calculated over the entire training set, but rather at the batch level.</li>\n<li><strong>Can it be applied to all layers in a neural network?</strong>: Batch normalization is normally applied to the hidden layers, which is where activations can destabilize during training. Since raw inputs are usually normalized beforehand, it is rare to apply batch normalization in the input layer. Likewise, applying it to the output layer is counterproductive, as it may break the assumptions made for the expected range for the output’s values, especially for instance in regression neural networks for predicting aspects like flight prices, rainfall amounts, and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A major positive impact of batch normalization is a strong reduction in the vanishing gradient problem. It also provides more robustness, reduces sensitivity to the chosen weight initialization method, and introduces a regularization effect. This regularization helps combat overfitting, sometimes eliminating the need for other specific strategies like dropout.</p>\n<h2>How to Implement it in Keras</h2>\n<p>Keras is a popular Python API on top of TensorFlow used to build neural network models, where designing the architecture is an essential step before training. This example shows how simple it is to implement batch normalization in a simple neural network to be trained with Keras:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p

The study is a position paper that lays out several insightful postulates about the potential of <strong>small language models</strong> (SLMs) to drive innovation in <strong>agentic AI systems</strong>, compared to their larger counterparts, the LLMs, which are currently the predominant component fueling modern agentic AI solutions in organizations.</p>\n<p>A couple of quick definitions before we jump into the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agentic AI systems</strong> are autonomous systems capable of reasoning, planning, making decisions, and acting in complex and dynamic environments. Recently, this paradigm, which has been investigated for decades, has gained renewed attention due to its significant potential and impact when used alongside state-of-the-art language models and other cutting-edge AI-driven applications. You can find a list of <strong>10 Agentic AI Key Terms Explained</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-agentic-ai-key-concepts-explained\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Language models</strong> are natural language processing (NLP) solutions trained on large datasets of text to perform a variety of language understanding and language generation tasks, including text generation and completion, question-answering, text classification, summarization, translation, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout this article, we will distinguish between small language models (SLMs) — those “small” enough to run efficiently on end-consumer hardware— and large language models (LLMs) — which are much larger and usually require cloud infrastructure. At times, we will simply use “language models” to refer to both from a more general perspective.</p>\n<h2>Authors’ Position</h2>\n<p>The article opens by highlighting the increasing relevance of agentic AI systems and their significant level of adoption by organizations today, usually in a symbiotic relationship with language models. State-of-the-art solutions, however, traditionally rely on LLMs due to their deep, general reasoning capabilities and their broad knowledge, gained from being trained on vast datasets.</p>\n<p>This “status quo” and assumption that LLMs are the universal go-to approach for integration into agentic AI systems is precisely what the authors challenge through their position: they suggest <strong>shifting some attention to SLMs that</strong>, despite their smaller size compared to LLMs, <strong>could be a better approach for agentic AI in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and system adaptability</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some key views underpinning the claim that SLMs, rather than LLMs, are “the future of agentic AI” are summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SLMs are sufficiently powerful to undertake most current agentic tasks\n</li><li>SLMs are better suited for modular agentic AI architectures\n</li><li>SLMs’ deployment and maintenance are more feasible\n</li></ul>\n<p>The paper further elaborates on these views with the following arguments:</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Aptitude for Agentic Tasks</h3>\n<p>Several arguments are provided to support this view. One is based on empirical evidence that SLM performance is rapidly improving, with models like Phi-2, Phi-3, SmoILM2, and more, reporting promising results. On another note, as AI agents are typically instructed to excel at a limited range of language model capabilities, properly fine-tuned SLMs should often be appropriate for most domain-specific applications, with the added benefits of efficiency and flexibility.</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Suitability for Agentic AI Architectures</h3>\n<p>The small size and reduced pre-training and fine-tuning costs of SLMs make them easier to accommodate in typically modular agentic AI architectures and easier to adapt to ever-evolving user needs, behaviors, and requirements. Meanwhile, a well-fine-tuned SLM for selected domain-specific prompt sets can be sufficient for specialized systems and settings, although LLMs will generally have a broader understanding of language and the world as a whole. On another note, as AI agents frequently interact with code, conformance to certain formatting requirements is also a concern to ensure consistency. Consequently, SLMs trained with narrower formatting specifications would be preferable.</p>\n<p>The heterogeneity inherent in agentic systems and interactions is another reason why SLMs are argued to be more suitable for agentic architectures, as these interactions serve as a pathway to gather data.</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Economic Feasibility</h3>\n<p>SLM flexibility can be easily translated into a higher potential for democratization. The aforementioned reduced operational costs are a major reason for this. In more economic terms, the paper compares SLMs against LLMs concerning inference efficiency, fine-tuning agility, edge deployment, and parameter usage: aspects in which SLMs are considered superior.</p>\n<h2>Alternative Views, Barriers, and Discussion</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/small-language-models-are-the-future-of-agentic-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
