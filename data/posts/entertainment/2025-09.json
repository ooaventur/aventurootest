At the same time, Rick Flag Sr. (</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/frank-grillo/\">), the new acting director of ARGUS, pursues Peacemaker as a threat after the death of his son, Rick Flag Jr. (</a>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/joel-kinnaman/\">), at his hands, putting pressure on Emilia Harcourt (</a>\n    </p>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Holland</strong>) to betray him.</p>\n<p>During this interview with Collider, co-stars Holland and Grillo discussed how much they truly love working with Cena, getting to explore the Harcourt and Peacemaker relationship in different dimensions, getting to explore Harcourt’s history with Rick Flag Jr., and what it was like for Grillo to beat up Cena for a very intense moment between them.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>Collider: Frank, you’ve mentioned how fantastic John Cena’s behind is, which I think he’d be fine with us talking about since he puts it on display. What have you most enjoyed about working with him and about going up against him? How is he as an acting sparring partner?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>FRANK GRILLO: He’s a terrific actor. He’s fantastic. With all the stuff that he does, he’s got a very complex role. He makes it look easy, but it’s not. He really is doing something that is difficult, and I appreciate him for that. And then, he’s John Cena, on top of it, and he’s got to make you forget that for a little while. I love working with him. The guy is a consummate professional. He’s always positive. There’s no diva stuff. He’s just so giving and self-effacing. I can say that about everybody in the cast.<strong> It’s a great group of people who are all very seasoned and accomplished, and everybody’s there for the same reason.</strong> They want to serve this, they love doing it, and it shows on screen. And the captain of the ship is James Gunn, so he’s equally crazy.</p>\n<h2>\n                        <strong>Jennifer Holland Had Fun With the Harcourt and Chris Relationship in Two Different Dimensions in ‘Peacemeaker’ Season 2</strong>\n               </h2>\n<h3>\"I love the story that James [Gunn] crafted.\"</h3>\n<p>\n      <strong>Jennifer, what have you most enjoyed about getting to explore the relationship with Chris and Harcourt, and the journey that this season takes them on? There’s a lot going on between your characters this season, and in more than one dimension.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>JENNIFER HOLLAND: Yes. It’s just been so much fun to explore both the relationship with Carcourt in our dimension, and then the relationship with Christopher Smith and Harcourt in the other dimension, and getting to play both of those characters. I love the story that James crafted.<strong> I’m excited for everyone to maybe get some answers</strong> about what happened on the boat. It’s a really wonderfully crafted story. I had so much fun working with John. He’s so available. When you look into his eyes, you can tell that he’s present and he’s listening. He’s very quick-witted and quick on his feet and available. He’s such a great actor. He’s so present. I just have a fantastic time working with him. I feel so grateful for both of us to get to explore this relationship between Harcourt and Christopher Smith, and what that means and where it goes and where it doesn’t go, and all of that.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>In episode three, we get to see the relationship that Harcourt had with Rick Flag. What stood out most to you about their relationship, and how was it to have Joel Kinnaman pop in and out for that?</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://collider.com/peacemaker-season-2-jennifer-holland-frank-grillo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Far from a beat-by-beat interpretation of writing pioneer</p>\n<p><strong>Isaac Asimov</strong>'s series of the same name,</p>\n<p><strong>. Creating new characters out of whole cloth, uniting individuals who never meet in Asimov's canon, inventing heightened, more</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-anthology-format-david-s-goyer-comments/\">television-friendly steps</a>toward a segment's endgame — at this point, the list of changes is long yet rarely tedious.</p>\n<p>Between always playing fast and loose with the 10-book series and the many ways <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-3-finale-recap/\">Season 3's final episode</a> specifically resets the board, most bets are off regarding the recently announced fourth season. Likewise, co-creator <a href=\"https://collider.com/tag/david-s-goyer/\"> David S. Goyer</a> has handed the showrunner reins to new architects </p>\n<p><strong>Ian Goldberg</strong>and</p>\n<p><strong>David Kob</strong>. Fresh eyes can either improve or hinder a meticulously crafted series, although</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/foundation-season-3-episode-10-ending-explained-david-s-goyer/\">Goyer confirmed to The Wrap</a>that the new duo \"have his outlined plans for Season 4 and beyond, and stressed that he built off-ramps for the series in his design where it could potentially conclude after Season 4, after Season 6 or after Season 8.\" All these disclaimers aside, one can</p>\n<p><strong>cautiously predict Season 4’s main structure based on the other seasons' approach and the events of the next several books</strong>.</p>\n<h2>How Could ‘Foundation’ Season 4 Handle the Mule and Gaal Dornick’s Rematch?</h2>\n<p><i>Foundation</i>'s <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-2-story-arc-david-s-goyer-comments/\">multi-century timeline</a> is one of its staples and a major selling point. Covering such an extended scope of time requires frequent leaps into the future, the majority occurring in between seasons. Although nothing is written in stone that would prevent Goldberg and Kob from following this template, keeping any time-skips to a few months or years would be a refreshing break from tradition and, arguably, a necessary change. <strong>Jumping too far ahead risks undermining both the finale's urgency and its  immediate, raw aftermath</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since Season 3 adapts the sophomore novel's second half in broad strokes, there's little reason to assume Season 4 won't follow suit with the next novel, titled <i>Second Foundation</i>. The Mule, recently revealed in Apple TV+'s adaptation as <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-3-finale-mule-twist-bayta/\">charming socialite Bayta Mallow</a> (<strong>Synnøve Karlsen</strong>), will undoubtedly continue <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-3-the-mule-future-teased/\">her cat-and-mouse chase</a> after both Gaal Dornick (<strong>Lou Llobell</strong>) and the titular organization. This time, <strong>the Mule has a significant advantage over her weakened rival in the form of converted intelligence officer Han Pritcher</strong> (<strong>Brandon Bell</strong>). Following the Second Foundation's trail leads Han, the Mule, and one of the Mule's unconverted followers to investigate (and obliterate when necessary) several suspicious locations — one of them being Rossem, the agricultural society <i>Foundation</i> Season 3 makes <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-3-episode-7-recap/\">the Mule's home planet.</a></p>\n<p>The Second Foundation's relocation to Trantor positions First Speaker and new leader Preem Palver (<strong>Troy Kotsur</strong>) to follow his book counterpart's trajectory by leading a united army of trained Mentalics against the Mule. It's unlikely <i>Foundation</i> will downplay Gaal and the Mule's reunion, but <strong>Preem's resources could let him strike the final blow</strong> — be that the Mule's irreversible death or Asimov’s quieter, if no less dramatic, path of turning the Mule's arrogance, fear, and telepathic tactics against him. Since Asimov's version of Bayta contributes to <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-3-the-mule-demerzel-showdown/\">the Mule's downfall</a>, in part because she's the only person to genuinely care for the Mule's alter ego, Magnifico Giganticus (<strong>Tómas Lemarquis</strong>), Toran Mallow (<strong>Cody Fern</strong>) could assume a similar role.</p>\n<h2>The Robot Survivors Will Likely Bring ‘Foundation’ Season 4 Back to Earth</h2>\n<p> As for those secret robot survivors hanging out on Earth's moon and the mysterious \"pieces\" that are now \"in place,\" <strong> Season 4 can streamline several different options</strong>. </p>\n<p><i>Foundation’s Edge</i>, the fourth entry, introduces the Anti-Mules, a group suspected of interfering with Foundation for their unknown ends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://collider.com/apple-tv-plus-originals-book-adaptations-explained-2025-2026-slate/\">The next novel</a>,</p>\n<p><i>Foundation and Earth</i>, dedicates itself to a small human team's search for their origins.

Curiouser and curiouser, no one knows who scrubbed Earth's coordinates from every known historical record.</p>\n<p><i>Foundation</i>the show follows a similar mythology; memories of Earth only live on through Demerzel (</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Birn</strong>), who also called her creators' planet home.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://collider.com/foundation-season-4-storyline-books-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

When they're brought together by whimsical circumstances, they discover a door that sets them off on a journey through time and memories. <i>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</i> also stars <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong> (<i>Fleabag</i>), <strong>Hamish Linklater</strong> (<i>Midnight Mass</i>), <strong>Lily Rabe</strong> (<i>American Horror Story</i>), and <strong>Billy Magnussen</strong> (<i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i>).</p>\n<p>During his conversation with Collider's <a href=\"https://collider.com/author/steve-weintraub/\"> Steve Weintraub</a>, Kogonada discusses how Sony took a chance on </p>\n<p><i>A Big Bold Beautiful Journey</i>and its original concept. He talks about the message of the film, about \"restoring belief\" in humanity, and taking chances. Kogonada also discusses working with composer</p>\n<p><strong>Joe Hisaishi</strong>(</p>\n<p><i>Spirited Away</i>), the anime influences on the film, and shares the filmmaker who has had the biggest impact on him.</p>\n<h2>This Filmmaker Altered Kogonada's Reality</h2>\n<h3>\"It had a real profound effect, and I didn't really understand why, to be honest.\"</h3>\n<p> <strong>COLLIDER: So I did a little recon, and I didn't realize how much you’ve done short films on all these different filmmakers, like [Stanley] Kubrick, [Quentin] Tarantino, [Terrence] Malick, [Richard] Linklater, and restoring the Apu Trilogy. You've studied cinema. Do you have a favorite filmmaker?</strong></p>\n<p>KOGONADA: It's always been [Yasujirō] Ozu. I've done a couple of pieces on Ozu. I think that his films were life-altering for me. It wasn't just like, “Oh, this is a great filmmaker.” I was like, “Oh, there's something about the way he's presenting the world that is reshaping my metabolism and really altering the way I can navigate this modern world.” So, it had a real profound effect, and I didn't really understand why, to be honest. The first time I saw a film, I had read about him, and I was like, “Oh, I should watch an Ozu film,” and I was unimpressed. I was like, “This is about nothing.” I had an idea of what films should be. Then, I could just never shake it. Like, a week had passed, and I was like, “I have this feeling about this film. Not even an opinion, but the film is inside of me, and it feels like I'm experiencing a time in this Ozu way.” I was like, “What is this about?”</p>\n<p>So, I started watching his other films, and they always had this same impact with me. I think some of it probably was, at that point, too, kind of wrestling with my own Asian identity, but there was something about it that kind of felt like home, felt like my parents. But it was also at a deeper level because I think I was struggling with, like, how does one find meaning in a modern world? And all of those kinds of deeper questions that you have when you're younger and in pursuit of meaning. That had a profound change in me, so I would say Ozu for deeper reasons.</p>\n<p>\n      <strong>How do you view the health of the movie industry right now? Because I feel like in the decades past, films were really taking big chances and pursuing big ideas. For me, right now, it just feels like we're not taking as many risks. I don't know how you feel about that.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://collider.com/a-big-bold-beautiful-journey-your-name-anime-kogonada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
