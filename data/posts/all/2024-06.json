But <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/pixar/\">Pixar</a>‘s “<a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/inside-out-2/\">Inside Out 2</a>” <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/box-office/inside-out-2-and-bad-boys-boost-theaters-1235016788/\">delivered</a> and then some, with a rousing $155 million domestic gross plus $140 million international, the best opening of the year so far, and since last year’s “Barbie.” Screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/t/meg-lefauve/\">Meg LeFauve</a>, nominated in 2016 for writing the Oscar-winning animated original, rejoined Pixar for the sequel, starting before the pandemic pushed animated releases onto streaming. Now, Disney and Pixar are luring audiences back into theaters.</p>\n<p>“We didn’t know what was coming,” LeFauve said on Zoom. “The only pressure was it had to be sequel-worthy Pixar. You have to explain why. Can we go to new places and discover new things in this world? And can we dig into something personal and emotional and vulnerable to share?”</p>\n<p>At Pixar, the writing process for an animated feature is radically different than live-action movies. First, there’s the Brain Trust. Led by Pixar chief <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/why-pete-docters-oscar-frontrunner-inside-out-was-so-tough-to-make-into-must-see-pixar-175654/\">Pete Docter,</a> who dreamed up “Inside Out” in the first place, it’s a changing group of animators who give periodic feedback at each stage of the process. Sometimes, the all-stars show up, like “Wall-E” creator Andrew Stanton, or “Coco” director Lee Unkrich. \n\n</p>\n<p>“The Brain Trust is always evolving, because it is a living thing in terms of who’s at Pixar at that time,” said LeFauve. “Who’s working on what projects; can they take time off to come into a Brain Trust? Pete Doctor is the creative leader but is attuned to the same philosophies of a Brain Trust of getting multiple voices creatively to turn it up and give you ideas and places to look and maybe blind spots. So that has stayed much the same.”</p>\n<p>“Inside Out 2” director Kelsey Mann pitched three ideas to Docter, but the Anxiety emotion story was clearly the one. “Kelsey went to the personal, to himself,” said LeFauve, “and was vulnerable talking about himself at that cusp [of adolescence]. He showed me pictures of himself when he was six and had a birthday party (‘Look at me!’) and the next birthday party, he’s getting a little bit more remote; by the time he’s 13: ‘I wish everyone would just go away.’ I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s me.’ My dad called me Moody Meg. I can relate.”</p>\n<p>Mann and LeFauve’s first task was to convince Docter and the Brain Trust that with the advent of puberty, Riley needed to add new emotions like Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui to the core group: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. At the beginning, when the writers are trying to find a movie, the Brain Trust starts small. “I want to investigate anxiety, but what’s the story?” said LeFauve. “Pixar is all about, ‘Is this the best story?’ It’s about iteration, and it’s about fail fast. So you’re always pushing, pushing, pushing out to the edge of your creativity. They want you to fail, because then they know you’re trying for something, but fail fast, because we’ve got to get a movie going here. At the beginning we’re at that delicate stage of putting together our ideas.”</p>\n<p>And then once you have an outline, “or a scriptment,” said LeFauve, “then you have a larger Brain Trust, because now you’re ready to go to script. And then you go to script, and you have another one. And those can blow up. They can be ‘we like this half,’ or ‘this could be the best thing ever, go forward.’ You never know what you’re going to get. But there’s always good ideas coming. From the script, you’re churning, churning, churning, and then they’re starting to draw, you have to have some character design going on.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/film/film/inside-out-2-writer-meg-lefauve-pixar-brain-trust-1235017147/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
