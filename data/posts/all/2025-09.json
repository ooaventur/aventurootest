Two former leaders of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explained why they suddenly departed in a Senate hearing. They also described how CDC employees are being instructed to turn their backs on scientific evidence.<br/>They painted a picture of a health agency in turmoil—and at risk of harming the people it is meant to serve. And, just hours afterwards, a panel of CDC advisers voted to stop recommending the MMRV vaccine for children under four. <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/18/1123844/meeting-vaccine-guidance-former-cdc-leaders-alarmed/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*\">Read the full story</a>.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>—Jessica Hamzelou</i>\n    </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>This article first appeared in The Checkup, MIT Technology Review’s weekly biotech newsletter.

    "body": "<p>Everyone online is searching for “free speech” right now.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google\">Google</a> Trends <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=free%20speech&amp;hl=en\">data</a> of the past 30 days, searches for “free speech” have skyrocketed since conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination on a college campus ― and there have been many reasons for it over the past few days. </p>\n<p>There’s Kirk’s death to begin with. The late conservative activist advocated on behalf of free speech, and then was killed while speaking on a college campus. And the reactions to his death are also raising First Amendment concerns as pilots, teachers, and many other workers across America have been <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/url-charlie-kirk-people-fired-free-speech_l_68c86e62e4b00ea64839c70e\">getting doxxed</a> and losing their jobs for sharing their opinions about his death. </p>\n<p>Now, most recently, the latest target has been late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.</p>\n<p>“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">Kimmel said</a> in his Monday show. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr said that Kimmel’s comments were part of a “concerted effort to lie to the American people,” and he threatened penalties for ABC if it didn’t take action to discipline Kimmel for his comments.</p>\n<p>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">said</a> on a right-wing podcast.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, ABC swiftly <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk_n_68cb3778e4b0a2e5bdc6f10b\">said</a> it was suspending “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” indefinitely. President <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> celebrated the news, congratulating “ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” on a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/topic/truth-social\">Truth Social</a> post, which then got reposted on the official White House <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOuSQCrjxAE/?hl=en\">account</a>. </p>\n<p>So it’s no surprise that one of the top online Google searches right now is free speech related to Jimmy Kimmel, because his firing is especially alarming to free speech experts.</p>\n<p>“Now people are going to be even more hesitant to speak,” said Mark A. Graber, a regents professor of law at the University of Maryland, and a leading scholar on constitutional law and politics. “The way a society drifts from a democracy to a competitive authoritarian regime is not in one blow, but lots of drips.”</p>\n<p>Graber said ABC’s actions will make it easier for other businesses to do the same with speech they do not like.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why So Many People Are Searching To Understand ‘Free Speech’ Right Now</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Kimmel’s suspension raises First Amendment concerns because of the government’s involvement. Carr’s words, at minimum, imply that regulatory action might depend on how a company responds to Kimmel’s remarks, said Adam Steinbaugh, senior attorney for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.</p>\n<p>“If Carr had said nothing, had done nothing, and ABC said, ‘You know what? Jimmy Kimmel, we don’t like what you said. We’re going to pull you off the air’ –– that’s not a First Amendment problem. That might be a cultural free speech issue, but it’s not a legal First Amendment issue,” Steinbaugh said. But because of Carr’s involvement, “Now it’s a First Amendment problem,” he said.</p>\n<p>That’s because the Supreme Court has unanimously <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/supreme-court/national-rifle-association-v-vullo\">ruled</a> that “what the government can’t do through direct action, it can’t do through coercion either,” Steinbaugh said, citing the 2024 National Rifle Association v. Vullo case. </p>\n<p>What might also be causing more confusion for people this week is how a key member of the Trump administration is interpreting the First Amendment. Attorney General Pam Bondi recently said the administration plans to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/pam-bondi-first-amendment-hate-speech-prosecution-00566424\">broadly target “hate speech”</a> centered around Kirk ― even though the Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/hate-speech-protected-first-amendment\">found</a> no general exception for offensive, repugnant or hateful expression. Bondi later walked back her statements. </p>\n<p>The First Amendment doesn’t protect everything you say, though. Hateful speech is not protected when a person’s words incite imminent lawless action or threaten serious bodily harm, for example.</p>\n<p>Steinbaugh said that in the wake of Kirk’s death, he would hope that “as a nation, we would have a renewed commitment to say, ‘All right, there is speech out there that we don’t like or that people might find deeply offensive, but the solution can’t be violence and the solution can’t be state censorship,’” he said.</p>\n<p>“Instead, it seems like... what’s happening is even more questions around free speech being raised,’” he said. “We are right now, I think, making the nation less educated about the First Amendment and about free speech as we go through a period of social and political turmoil.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-google_n_68cc0dd3e4b0aa8d99fe85fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

My maternal grandfather passed last year and it unearthed a lot of trauma on my mom’s side. My mom has been the one caring for my grandparents, both financially and in terms of managing their medical appointments, shopping for groceries, and even ordering an electric stair lift after my grandma had a fall. It was incredibly painful watching my aunts call my mom selfish for wanting to stop life-prolonging measures for my grandpa, something his care team advocated for, too. I spent many nights trying to comfort him as he choked on mucus, translating to Chinese whatever the nurses were doing to him, just in case he could hear. Now that grandpa has passed, the sisterly conversations have turned towards who will manage and pay for my grandma’s care.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br/></strong>I was a peer tutor in sixth grade, making $1.50 an hour.

The cosmos is offering us a moment of reprieve, something we haven't had in a long time. Now, we can sit back and plan our fall easily, knowing that the best is yet to come.<p>The sun will be in an airy Venusian sign, so we will be inclined to spend our days and nights socializing and even </p><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch\">hitting up dating apps</a>to find a new crush. If you're in a relationship, you'll find that Venus’s movement into Libra, which begins on October 13th, is a prime time to deepen the bond. Plan a getaway together to take photos of the<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/propaganda-trend-social-media-problem\">foliage for social media</a>. Unattached? Hit the road with friends and upload the pics to your Hily profile.<p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Beware of the Supermoon in Aries on October 6th. We might believe in the goodness of others too much, so we become blindsided by who they are. The lesson is to trust your instincts. Even though we'll want to intellectualize and make excuses for them (a tendency brought on by Libra energy), we must be real and honest about matters. Yes, this does include our own actions. Listen to the voice within or the advice you're given now. The universe is trying to protect you and have your back, so pay attention. If people want to be shady, that’s on them. Know that you don’t have to play games and can maturely walk away.</p><p>The flip side is that another might consume us so much that we forget our obligations. Since the sun is in Libra, no one wants to be a bad pal who doesn't give their besties enough attention. The situation is easy to overcome; you only have to acknowledge the issue and apologize. Like I said before, Libra season is drama-free. Even the most frustrating moments aren't awful… as long as we deal with matters ASAP and move forward. </p><p>The best way to get through Libra season is to celebrate all that life has to offer. Honor the past, present, and future. You’ll be happy that you took time out of your schedule to do so, because the year is almost ending, and it's important to commemorate the small wins. You only get one chance to embrace the sweetness of fall and this is it! </p><p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><h4>Important Astrological Dates for Libra Season:</h4><p><strong>September 22nd:</strong>The sun enters Libra the same day as the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, igniting our spirits with bliss.</p><p><strong>October 6th:</strong>Mercury dives into Scorpio, urging us to suss out the truth. For the next few weeks, we’ll take on the role as an investigator, searching for wisdom and insight.</p><p><strong>October 6th:</strong>The Super Full Moon in Aries, known as the Hunter’s Moon, ignites our desires. It will be a spicy time for us to get our passions going. The sparky and fiery energy within burns bright due to the Supermoon in Aries.</p><p><strong>October 13th:</strong>Venus moves into tender Libra, heightening the desire for romance. Write a love letter, send flowers, or serenade that special person. For the daring peeps, go on an adventure with your crew. Relish the seasonal beauty and the breeze in your hair.</p><p><strong>October 21st:</strong>The New Moon in Libra encourages us to commit to a financial plan or a relationship. The caveat is that we might rush matters instead of letting them occur naturally. The heart wants what the heart wants.</p><p><strong>October 22nd:</strong>Neptune retrograde swims back into Pisces, highlighting mid-March. Think about how your dreams have evolved and what you wish to attain. You can also revisit creative ventures from the past and transform them into greatness.</p><p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

That suggests the buyers are not rushing to the exit as they anticipate a move toward the all-time high of $124,474.</p>\n<p>BTC researcher Axel Adler Jr. said in a post on X that the “market is neither overheated nor oversold” at the current level. That could result in one to two weeks of consolidation before <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-has-70percent-chance-of-hitting-new-highs-in-2-weeks-analyst\" title=\"null\">BTC rises to a new all-time high</a>.</p>\n<p>Several analysts expect BTC to hit a new all-time high. Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said in an interview that the rally could peak quickly after making a new high. Once the top is in, Cowen does not rule out <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-drawdown-bear-market-buying-dip-benjamin-cowen\" title=\"null\">a 70% fall in the next bear market</a>.</p>\n<p>Could BTC break out of its overhead resistance, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>BTC pierced the $117,500 overhead resistance on Thursday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($114,457) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A close above $117,500 opens the gates for a rally to $124,474.</p>\n<p>Contrary to this assumption, a break below the 20-day EMA signals that the bulls are closing their positions in a hurry. The BTC/USDT pair could then drop to $110,000, remaining inside the $107,000 to $117,500 range for a while longer.</p>\n<h2>Ether price prediction</h2>\n<p>Ether (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price\" title=\"null\">ETH</a>) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the buyers and sellers.</p>\n<p>If the price turns down and breaks below the support line, it signals that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The ETH/USDT pair could collapse to $4,060 and, after that, to the pattern target of $3,426.</p>\n<p>Buyers will be back in the driver’s seat if they kick the price above the resistance line. That improves the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. The Ether price could then rally toward the pattern target of $5,586.</p>\n<h2>XRP price prediction</h2>\n<p>XRP (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index\" title=\"null\">XRP</a>) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2.99) on Tuesday, but the bulls could not clear the overhead barrier at $3.20.</p>\n<p>The bears are striving to pull the price below the moving averages to seize control. If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could descend toward the strong support at $2.73. Such a move suggests the breakout above the downtrend line was a bull trap. A close below $2.69 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern, clearing the path for a fall to $2.20.</p>\n<p>The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above $3.20 to signal a short-term trend change. The XRP price may then ascend to $3.40 and eventually to $3.66. </p>\n<h2>BNB price prediction</h2>\n<p>BNB (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index\" title=\"null\">BNB</a>) jumped over the psychological level of $1,000 on Thursday, indicating sustained demand from the bulls. </p>\n<p>The bears will try to defend the $1,000 level, but if the buyers prevail, the BNB/USDT pair could extend the rally to $1,090.</p>\n<p>The 20-day EMA ($915) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the up move.</p>\n<p>Sellers will have to pull and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA to signal strength. The BNB price may then collapse to the 50-day SMA ($855).</p>\n<h2>Solana price prediction</h2>\n<p>Solana (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index\" title=\"null\">SOL</a>) turned down from $253 on Thursday, indicating that the bears are aggressively defending the $260 level.</p>\n<p>The pullback is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA ($225). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with force, the bulls will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at $260. If they manage to pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could skyrocket toward $295.</p>\n<p>Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are booking profits. That could pull the Solana price to the uptrend line, which is likely to attract buyers.</p>\n<h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2>\n<p>Dogecoin (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index\" title=\"null\">DOGE</a>) turned up from the $0.26 level on Tuesday, but the bulls are facing stiff resistance from the bears at $0.29.</p>\n<p>If the price rebounds off the $0.26 level again, it shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That increases the likelihood of a break above $0.31. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could start a new up move to $0.35 and subsequently to $0.44.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.25) suggests that the bulls have given up. The Dogecoin price may then tumble to the 50-day SMA ($0.23). That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.21 and $0.29 for some time. </p>\n<h2>Cardano price prediction</h2>\n<p>Cardano (<a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index\" title=\"null\">ADA</a>) turned down from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling that the bears are fiercely defending the level.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/price-predictions-9-19-btc-eth-xrp-bnb-sol-doge-ada-hype-link-avax?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.</strong></p><p>Grab a coffee because the year’s final stretch is shaping up to be pivotal for Bitcoin (BTC). With the Federal Reserve (Fed) beginning what looks like its rate-cutting cycle, analysts believe the pioneer crypto could be setting up for a record-breaking run.</p><h2>Crypto News of the Day: Analysts Eye $145,000 Bitcoin by December as Liquidity Shifts After Fed Cuts</h2>Sponsored<p>Bitcoin bulls are finding fresh momentum after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">Fed’s September rate cut</a>, with analysts now projecting a potential year-end rally toward record highs.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">liquidity dynamics shifting</a> and institutional flows accelerating, some analysts believe Bitcoin could end 2025 near the $145,000 mark.</p><p>John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Investment Officer, told BeInCrypto he expects a sharp move higher as investors reposition for a weaker dollar.</p><blockquote><p>“I’m forecasting a BTC price of circa $140,000 to $145,000 by year’s end. The rate cuts will help to push this narrative as money moves to BTC for safe haven among expectations of a USD devaluation,” Glover said.</p></blockquote><p>This forecast suggests a growing conviction that the Fed’s policy pivot will funnel capital into non-yielding, alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p><p>With real interest rates under pressure, digital assets are increasingly framed as macro hedges and liquidity beneficiaries. Jake Kennis, Senior Research Analyst at Nansen, echoed the bullish tone.</p><blockquote><p>“With the Fed cutting 25 bps and its projections indicating two additional cuts by December, the macro backdrop turns more supportive for Bitcoin into year-end,” Kennis told BeInCrypto.</p></blockquote><p>However, the Nansen executive articulated that the Fed’s path is not the only driver. In his opinion, end-of-year levels hinge more on real rates, dollar strength, liquidity, and broader market dynamics.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>Kennis highlighted that lower policy rates reduce the opportunity cost of <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps\">holding Bitcoin</a> and can ease financial conditions.</p><p>If real yields drift lower and <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf\">Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds)</a> inflows persist, he believes the “path of least resistance is higher.”</p><p>Still, Nansen’s Kennis warned that recessionary cuts could weigh on broader risk assets, potentially tempering crypto upside.</p><h2>Institutional Flows and Options Markets Signal Growing Confidence in Bitcoin</h2><p>Institutional participation also marks a major shift from previous cycles. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf\">US spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, alongside the rise of digital asset treasuries (DATs), reported in a recent <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/standard-chartered-ethereum-treasuries-us-crypto-news/\">US Crypto News</a> publication, have simplified allocations for funds, pensions, and corporates.</p><p>If the SEC finalizes a <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-benefit-sec-new-etf-listing-standards/\">generic listing framework for spot digital-asset ETFs</a>, as reports suggest, product breadth could expand further, accelerating mainstream adoption.</p><p>Markets appear to be adjusting in real time. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/rate-cut-roulette-0-25-50-bps-bitcoin-altcoins/\">Bitcoin has held above $115,000 in the post-FOMC rally</a>, with Glassnode data showing 95% of supply now in profit.</p><p><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Options markets also reflect the bullish tilt</a>. Open interest has surged toward record levels ahead of next week’s massive September 26 expiry, where $18 billion in notional contracts come due.</p><p>While skeptics caution that <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> spikes and profit-taking remain likely, the narrative of rate cuts fueling Bitcoin as a macro hedge is gaining ground.</p><p>If Glover’s and Kennis’ projections hold, Bitcoin could run 24% above current levels by year-end and realize the $145,000 target.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<h2>Chart of the Day</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZNJaovz9/\">TradingView</a></p><h2>Byte-Sized Alpha</h2><p>Here’s a summary of more US crypto news to follow today:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/binance-cz-trust-wallet-token-twt-utility-roadmap/\">Binance founder CZ sparks 25% Trust Wallet Token (TWT)</a>rally after utility roadmap reveal.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\">Bitcoin may drop to $105,000</a>if it loses this level.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\">Over $4.3 billion Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum options expire today</a>–<a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">Volatility</a>ahead for BTC and ETH?</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/upbit-lists-four-altcoins-ethfi-resolv-init-spk/\">Upbit expands market</a>with four new altcoin listings.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cathie-wood-backs-300m-solana-deal-on-italian-soccer-team-owner/\">Cathie Wood backs $300 million Solana deal</a>on Italian soccer team owner.</li><li>This is why <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/cardano-traders-should-prepare-for-liquidations/\">Cardano traders should prepare for $73 million liquidations</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\">Bitcoin price hints at a 2% dip</a>before resuming $120,000+ journey.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/xrp-etf-launch-breaks-records-but-price-lags/\">XRP ETF launch breaks records</a>, but price lags behind market rally.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/kalshi-overtakes-polymarket-nfl-season-prediction-market/\">Kalshi overtakes Polymarket</a>as NFL season fuels $500 million prediction market surge.</li><li><a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/paypal-usd-stellar-xlm-price/\">PayPal USD officially launches on Stellar</a>– What does this mean for XLM price?</li></ul><h2>Crypto Equities Pre-Market Overview</h2><table><row span=\"3\"><cell><i>Company</i></cell><cell><i>At the Close of September 18</i></cell><cell><i>Pre-Market Overview</i></cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Strategy (MSTR)</cell><cell>$349.12</cell><cell>$348.44 (-0.19%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Coinbase (COIN)</cell><cell>$343.13</cell><cell>$341.00 (-0.62%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY)</cell><cell>$33.08</cell><cell>$32.70 (-1.15%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>MARA Holdings (MARA)</cell><cell>$18.50</cell><cell>$18.34 (-0.86%)</cell></row><row span=\"3\"><cell>Riot Platforms (RIOT)</cell><cell>$17.51</cell><cell>$17.39 (-0.71%)</cell></row><row><cell>Core Scientific (CORZ)</cell><cell>$16.75</cell><cell>$16.90 (+0.90%)</cell></row></table><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/\">Google Finance</a></p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/fed-rate-cuts-bitcoin-145000-us-crypto-news/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

The firm warns that a failure to do so could lead to a drop to $105,500.</p><h2>Record Options Expiration Looms</h2><p>Glassnode’s data shows that fears of a major price decline have lessened since the Fed’s announcement. While the spot market showed some minor selling pressure, risk-off positions in the derivatives market noticeably increased.</p>Sponsored<p>Open interest in the perpetuals market has slightly decreased. Glassnode noted that open interest, which had peaked at 3.95 million BTC, has now dropped to 3.78 million BTC. An analysis of liquidation data shows that while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/high-spread-between-bitcoin-derivatives-and-spot/\">short positions were squeezed</a> just before the rate announcement, the proportion of long position liquidations increased after the rate cut.</p><p>The potential for major <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> remains, however, as the open interest in the options market has hit a record high of 5 million BTC. A record amount of these options are set to expire next Friday, on September 26.</p><h2>Drop Below $115,200 Could Break Momentum</h2><p>Glassnode suggests paying close attention to the Bitcoin options’ “max pain” price. With both a price increase and decrease on the table, a large-scale liquidation event on either side could have a significant impact on the spot price.</p><p>The current <a href=\"https://%244.3%20Billion%20Bitcoin%20&amp;%20Ethereum%20Options%20Expire%20Today%20%20BeInCrypto%20https://beincrypto.com%20%E2%80%BA%20bitcoin-ethereum-options-expi...\">max pain</a> price for long positions is $112,700, while for short positions it’s $121,600. As of this article’s writing, Bitcoin’s price is fluctuating around $116,990.</p><p>Most of the Bitcoin traded on-chain since the September FOMC has been above $115,200. Glassnode states that maintaining this price level is key to preserving momentum, while losing it risks a drop to $105,500.</p><p>Ultimately, staying above $115,200 would maintain demand-driven momentum, while a drop below that level risks a retraction into the $105,500 to $115,200 range. Glassnode concludes that a comprehensive look at the on-chain signals suggests that market participants may be in a state of waiting for Bitcoin’s direction to be decided.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-may-slide-down-to-105k-if-it-loses-this-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

At press time, it was trading near $117,100, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The breakout from a head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10 still points higher, with a first target of $120,800.</strong></p><p>But not everything is smooth. Two on-chain red flags, selling from large balance groups and younger coin holders, hint at a possible 2% correction before the rally resumes.</p><h2>Selling Pressure Builds From Large Balance Groups</h2>Sponsored<p>Two of Bitcoin’s biggest wallet groups have trimmed their holdings since September 15. These groups are often referred to as “whales” and “sharks” — wallets holding 1,000–10,000 BTC and 10,000–100,000 BTC, respectively.</p><ul><li>The 1,000–10,000 BTC group dropped their holdings from 4.35 million BTC to 4.33 million BTC.</li><li>The 10,000–100,000 BTC group fell from 2.17 million BTC to 2.16 million BTC.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://app.santiment.net/charts/BK58RjBT__sCl\">Santiment</a></p><p>That’s a net outflow of about 30,000 BTC in just four days. With today’s <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-soars-following-fed-rate-cut/\">Bitcoin price</a> above $117,000, nearly $3.5 billion worth of BTC has been trimmed from holdings.</p><p><strong>Want more token insights like this? </strong>Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter <a href=\"https://go.beincrypto.com/4lUzHZj\">here</a>.</p><p>Such drops often signal that large investors are booking profits or preparing for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a>.</p><h2>Younger Coins Show Fresh Selling</h2><p>Another key on-chain signal confirms the picture: Spent Output Age Bands. This metric shows what percentage of coins from different “age groups” are being moved or sold. In other words, it tracks how much of the supply last moved weeks or months ago is now being spent again.</p><p>Over the past two weeks, every younger age cohort has increased its share of spent coins:</p><ul><li>1 week to 1 month holders: rose from 8.72% to 9.78%.</li><li>1 to 3 month holders: rose from 3.67% to 6.08%.</li><li>3 to 6 month holders: rose from 2.04% to 3.26%.</li><li>6 to 12 month holders: rose from 1.64% to 3.18%. (relatively younger considering BTC’s history)</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/indicators.Soab?a=BTC&amp;mScl=lin&amp;s=1757047420&amp;u=1758257020&amp;zoom=14\">Glassnode</a></p><p>These cohorts are considered “younger” because they bought or moved their coins within the last year. Unlike long-term holders who keep Bitcoin for multiple years, younger holders are quicker to sell into Bitcoin price rallies.</p><p>The rise across all four bands means more short- to mid-term holders might be cashing out. This aligns with the selling already visible from the big balance groups, forming a clear picture of near-term supply pressure.</p><h2>Bitcoin Price Chart Still Points Higher, But With Risks</h2>Sponsored<p>Despite the selling signs, the broader technical setup remains bullish. <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-flag-breakout-hurdle/\">Bitcoin broke above</a> an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on September 10, and the breakout level has held since then. As long as the Bitcoin price stays above $114,900, the immediate upside target remains at $120,800.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/HEOJm180/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT\">TradingView</a></p><p>However, a dip toward $114,900 looks more realistic in the short term, as <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> data has flashed another risk. Between August 22 and September 18, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-grip-weakens-heres-why/\">Bitcoin’s price </a>formed lower highs while <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/\">RSI</a> made higher highs. </p><p>This hidden bearish divergence often signals that momentum is slowing, leaving room for a brief 2% pullback (the immediate and strongest support level).</p><p>Yet, if the Bitcoin price dips under $114,900, the pullback could stretch further toward $110,000. A daily close under that level would weaken the bullish structure.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dip-before-120k-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body><p><strong>Despite Bitcoin (BTC) showing strength over the last few days, traders and investors should expect some  volatility during the early hours of the European session on Friday amid the anticipation of options expiry.</strong></p><p>However, the impact could be short-lived, given that markets quickly adjust to new trading environments shortly after.</p><h2>What Traders Should Know About Today’s Options Expiry</h2>Sponsored<p>Data on Deribit shows that over $4.3 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) options will expire today. For Bitcoin, the expiring options have a notional value of $3.5 billion and a total open interest of 30,208.</p><p>With a Put-to-Call ratio 1.23, the maximum pain level for today’s expiring Bitcoin options is $114,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>For their Ethereum counterparts, the notional value for today’s expiring ETH options is $806.75 million, with total open interest of 177,398.</p><p>Unlike Bitcoin, however, today’s expiring Ethereum options have a Put-to-Call Ratio (PCR) below 1, with Deribit data showing 0.99 as of this writing. Meanwhile, the maximum pain level, or strike price, is $4,500.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/ETH/metrics/options\">Deribit</a></p><p>The maximum pain point is a crucial metric in <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/\">crypto options trading</a>. It represents the price level at which most options contracts expire worthless. This scenario inflicts the maximum financial loss, or “pain,” on traders holding these options. </p><p>Notably, today’s expiring Bitcoin and Ethereum options are <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-4-billion/\">slightly higher than last week’s</a>. On September 12, BeInCrypto reported nearly $4.3 billion expiring options, highlighting 29,651 BTC and 189,700 ETH contracts, with notional values of $3.42 billion and $858.2 million, respectively.</p><p>However, the main difference between this week’s expiring options and those seen last week is that this time, Ethereum expiring options have a PCR below 1.</p><p>A PCR below 1 indicates that more Call (Purchase) options are traded than Put (Sale) options. Therefore, this suggests a bullish market sentiment for Ethereum, and bearish sentiment for Bitcoin, which has more Puts than Calls.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s PCR at 1.23 and Ethereum’s at 0.99 suggest an almost balanced bet among traders between sale and purchase orders.</p><p>This balanced outlook comes as investors speculate whether the market will move higher or are hedging their portfolios in case of a sell-off.</p><h2>Options Market Signals Caution After Fed Cut as Record Expiry Looms</h2>Sponsored<p>In hindsight, it is worth noting that options had repriced ahead of the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/feds-25bps-cut-labor-risks-inflation-liquidity-bets/\">Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>With this, implied <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> for options contracts rose while trading volume declined, suggesting market caution.</p><blockquote><p>“Options are repricing ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate meeting, with implied</p><a href=\"\">volatility</a>on options expiring tomorrow rising significantly. Recent actual<a href=\"\">volatility</a>has also been substantial, showing a marked increase compared to last month, yet actual trading volume has declined instead,” analysts at Greeks.live had<a href=\"\">noted</a>.</blockquote><p>Glassnode highlights a post-rate-cut patience in the market, with Bitcoin trading above 115,200 and 95% of supply in profit after the <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-as-us-federal-reserve-opts-for-25bps-rate-cut/\">FOMC rally</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“</p><a href=\"\">Futures</a>show short squeezes, and options open interest hit a record 500,000 BTC ahead of the September 26 expiry. Holding above 115,200 is key while a drop risks a move back toward 105,500,”<a href=\"\">wrote</a>Glassnode analysts.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that next Friday, September 26, the largest weekly Bitcoin options expiry in history will be seen. On that day, over $18 billion in notional value will expire.</p>Sponsored Sponsored<p>At the $118,000 Bitcoin price level, over $2.4 billion is in the money, with a maximum pain of $110,000. The Put open interest is minimal until $110,000.</p><p>Therefore, next week could be interesting. The margin usually drives short-term price action, so markets should not be surprised to see a flush despite the sentiment.</p><p>In the meantime, however, traders should brace for <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/\">volatility</a> because the max pain concept often influences market behavior.</p><p>According to the Max Pain theory, the asset’s price tends to gravitate toward this level as options near expiration.</p><p>As the options near their expiry time, 8:00 UTC on Deribit, the Bitcoin price, <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/\">trading for $117,147 as of this writing</a>, could pull toward its max pain at $114,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum, which was <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/\">trading for $4,590</a>, could drop toward $4,500.</p><p>Nevertheless, markets usually stabilize soon after traders adapt to the new price environment. With today’s high-volume expiration, traders and investors can expect a similar outcome, potentially influencing market trends into the weekend.</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-options-expire-today-volatility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

One to six individuals can come together to form an SMSF.</p>\n<p>SMSFs are largely unique to Australia.

These investors plan to allocate an average of $67,000 to cryptocurrency, indicating a growing mainstream interest in digital assets for retirement portfolios.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, OKX took the lead by launching its SMSF product in June 2025, and the demand has exceeded expectations. OKX’s advantage lies in its simplified approach, providing not only crypto access but also connecting clients with accountants and legal advisers to facilitate SMSF setup and <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-okx-crypto-australia-retirement-system\">compliance</a>.</p>\n<p>These efforts highlight how global exchanges are tailoring their strategies to Australia’s distinctive retirement savings market, where the scale and regulatory environment position SMSFs as a key entry point for cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/36d86b39596f23c8ae34451b82f50db2.jpg\" title=\"Digital assets held in Australian SMSFs\"></p>\n<h2 data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-title\">                Multiple catalysts behind the move of Coinbase and OKX            </h2>\n<p data-ct-widget=\"explained-block-content\">                </p>\n<p><em>The efforts of Coinbase and OKX to enter Australia’s SMSFs are fueled by local demand and global policy changes.

Globally, policy developments are lending credibility to this trend. For example, a US executive order allowing cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) retirement plans indicates that digital assets are becoming part of mainstream retirement strategies.</p>\n<p>This global context strengthens confidence among Australian investors and regulators.

Stablecoin opposers point to <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-risk-crypto-transactions-bitrace-2024-report\" title=\"null\">transfers of illicit funds</a>. Proponents argue that the transparent nature of blockchains <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/debunking-the-myth-cryptocurrency-is-used-for-criminal-activity\" title=\"null\">can be used to detect such crimes</a>. </p><p>There is a lack of awareness of how a deep integration of stablecoins in global finance can drive the use of blockchain’s properties of immutability and transparency to fight financial crimes, even in traditional finance.</p><h2>The stablecoin story</h2><p>The stablecoin industry is going from strength to strength, aided by increased regulatory clarity and meaningful use cases. The ability to facilitate swifter, more cost-effective transactions than traditional banking rails has accelerated their adoption worldwide. The total value in circulation is <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/stablecoin-market-cap-surpasses-200-b-as-usdc-dominance-rises\" title=\"null\">estimated to be north of $200 billion</a>.<br></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-08/019864ed-c95d-78ba-83be-6bb720d761b7\" title=\"\"><figcaption><em>Average supply of stablecoins in circulation, across all stablecoins.

The payment economy might be on a metaphorical spiral staircase that runs back to pre-Civil War times. Back then, the US had hundreds of local banks, each issuing their own private currency to be used as legal tender. Despite being a part of everyday payments, those currencies were not accepted too far away from the issuing bank. In hindsight, this probably kept an unintended check on any attempt to obfuscate the money trail.</p><h2>Tracking illicit finance</h2><p>In contrast, with thriving crosschain interoperability, it can be safely assumed that users will not have to jump through hoops to convert one stablecoin to another or any other digital asset or off-ramp them to fiat. This vision of the near future, marked by unabated and instantaneous capital flows across jurisdictions, naturally translates to stringent regulations to address illicit finance. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\" rel=\"\" target=\"_self\" title=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-time-crypto-laundering-cex-vulnerabilities-report\"><em><strong>Real-time crypto laundering exposes CEX vulnerabilities — Report</strong></em></a></p><p><a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/genius-act-legitimizes-stablecoins-institutional-adoption\" title=\"null\">Regulatory</a> guardrails for stablecoins mandate adherence to the highest standards of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. Surprisingly, the prowess of stablecoins themselves, to beef up law enforcement’s fight against financial crime, is not yet a part of the crypto zeitgeist. </p><p>Stablecoins flowing across the globe on immutable, transparent, public blockchains add teeth to the global fight against illicit finance by providing traceability in international finance with a much-needed leg up.</p><h2>The old world</h2><p>The archaic structure of traditional finance severely handicaps counter-crime initiatives. This is primarily because each bank or financial institution is a walled garden, a closed ecosystem in which the central authority controls all accesses, processes and user experiences. </p><p>Compliance professionals at each such financial institution can only investigate financial activity that transpired strictly within the virtual walls of the organization. This is a sliver of any entity’s entire set of commercial dealings, as any firm or person typically engages with multiple financial institutions. </p><p>Any walled garden hosts only a partial picture of their customers. </p><p>Suspicious Activity Reports filed by each bank are based on an incomplete picture of their customers, potentially causing misreporting of risk levels. Additionally, this outdated predicament causes significant inefficiency for law enforcement agencies, as they must separately obtain access to records from each financial institution that the entity under investigation might have touched and then proceed to painstakingly stitch together the complete picture.</p><h2>The new world</h2><p>A world with agile, international capital flows on stablecoin rails will enable law enforcement to study suspicious patterns using unfragmented, reliable and transparent information gathered directly from blockchains. Tracing across jurisdictions will not entail navigating red tape.</p><p><br>On a more thought-provoking note, a robust stablecoin payment economy will induce routine capital flows from traditional finance organizations to blockchains and vice versa. </p><p>Proceeds from real-world offenses, such as human trafficking, drug peddling and violent crimes, and crypto crimes, such as decentralized finance hacks, ransomware and crypto scams, might be laundered across a combination of traditional finance and crypto products. </p><p>Using live data from blockchains in AML initiatives can provide prompt intelligence even on criminal organizations that primarily use banks to place the spoils of their crimes.</p><p>Case in point, in recent times, the financial crime of sanctions evasion has <a data-ct-non-breakable=\"null\" href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-ruble-stablecoin-a7a5-grinex-link-garantex-ft\" title=\"null\">exhibited such patterns</a>, with sanctioned funds flowing interchangeably across both banking and stablecoin rails in an attempt to launder the same and dodge sanctions. </p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>The emergence of a pervasive stablecoin infrastructure will do wonders to showcase to the global compliance community how the ubiquitous transparency of public blockchains enables lightning-fast, sophisticated responses toward preventing and detecting illicit finance.</p><p>This can spur much-needed cooperation between anti-crime divisions within traditional finance and crypto, with each sharing relevant intelligence for cross-pollination.</p><p>Custodians of conventional financial products have not yet recognized that metaphorical bread crumbs strewn across blockchains can be used as well-founded signals to infer user intent. A stablecoin industry, deeply integrated with the global banking system, will influence the use of these assets to make the universal financial network safer.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Debanjan Chatterjee, financial analyst.</strong></em></p><p class=\"post-content__disclaimer\" type=\"\">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Speaking at the Chartered Professional Accountants conference in Ottawa, Morrow called for clear <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/senate-advances-genius-act-to-create-first-u-s-stablecoin-regulations\">regulations</a> to guide stablecoin usage. He stressed that as the digital asset market grows, Canadian regulators must act swiftly to maintain stability and security.</p>\n    <h2>Clear Rules Needed as Stablecoins Surge</h2>\n    <p><a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/jpmorgan-new-stablecoins-set-to-compete-with-circles-usdc-in-us-market/\">Stablecoins</a> have seen rapid growth in recent years, now handling transactions worth $1 trillion annually. <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/09/making-change-accelerating-payments-innovation/\">Morrow emphasized</a> that stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are more reliable for everyday use. He noted that their value is tied to stable assets, such as national currencies, which reduces price instability.</p>\n    <p>Morrow pointed out that while cross-border payments are vital, they must also be secure and efficient. He explained that these digital currencies could help lower transaction costs and speed up international transfers. However, for them to be trusted as real money, Morrow stated, they need clear and consistent regulations.</p>\n    <p>He called on federal and provincial regulators to cooperate on creating comprehensive rules for stablecoins. As interest in these digital assets grows, Canada must align its approach with global standards.</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i>“Stablecoins must be as safe and stable as the funds people hold in their bank accounts,” Morrow added.</i>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>Bank of Canada’s Approach to Payments Innovation</h2>\n    <p>Canada’s payment system has faced criticism for lagging behind global counterparts. Many argue that Canada’s banking infrastructure is slow, costly, and lacks competition. Morrow acknowledged these issues and stressed that Canada must modernize its payment system to stay competitive.</p>\n    <p>The Bank of Canada has explored digital currency options in the past. In 2022, it partnered with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate a central bank digital currency. However, by September 2024, the Bank decided to focus on a real-time payment system for instant transfers.</p>\n    <p>Morrow indicated that the country’s slow pace in adopting new technologies must change. He urged the Canadian government and regulators to use the current momentum to drive innovation. Modernizing Canada’s payment system is essential to providing Canadians with faster, cheaper, and more secure services.</p>\n    <h2>Global Stablecoin Regulation and Canada’s Role</h2>\n    <p>The rise of stablecoins has been supported by clearer regulations in the United States. The recent <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/genius-act-loophole-risks-draining-small-banks-senator-warns/\">GENIUS Act</a> in the U.S. has provided more certainty to the market, encouraging wider adoption. Morrow believes Canada must take similar steps to ensure stablecoins are safely integrated into the country’s financial system.</p>\n    <p>With the rapid growth of digital assets worldwide, Morrow warned that Canada risks falling behind. He highlighted the need for regulations that foster innovation while ensuring security. The Bank of Canada’s role in shaping the future of stablecoins will be crucial as global payment systems continue to evolve.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://blockonomi.com/bank-of-canada-calls-for-stablecoin-regulations-amid-global-shift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <p>While XRP celebrates its groundbreaking ETF launch and Cardano pushes forward with massive healthcare investments, both communities are experiencing something remarkable—yet incomplete.</p>\n    <p>These institutional wins represent genuine progress, but they also highlight the persistent technical barriers that prevent true blockchain revolution. The Layer Brett presale, <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">having raised over $3.78 million</a>, offers something entirely different: a community-driven escape from these limitations through revolutionary Layer 2 technology that transforms passive crypto holding into active participation.</p>\n    <h2>The hidden scalability crisis: Why XRP’s ETF success and Cardano’s $200M healthcare investment can’t fix core blockchain bottlenecks</h2>\n    <p>XRP’s recent institutional momentum tells an incredible story. The first U.S. XRP ETF launched in September, followed by CME adding futures options in October. This institutional embrace signals mainstream acceptance that XRP believers have championed for years. However, beneath this celebration lies an uncomfortable truth: institutional adoption doesn’t solve the fundamental throughput issues that limit real-world utility.</p>\n    <p>Cardano faces similar challenges despite Charles Hoskinson’s ambitious $200 million healthcare initiative in Wyoming. While ADA maintains resilience around $0.87 with surging trading volumes, the project still grapples with the same scalability constraints that have plagued blockchain networks since inception.</p>\n    <p>Both communities deserve better than watching institutional money validate their investments while the underlying technology remains constrained. The question becomes: what happens when institutional demand meets infrastructure limitations?</p>\n    <h2>Layer Brett’s community-driven solution: How our Layer 2 technology delivers what XRP and ADA promise but can’t execute</h2>\n    <p>This is where the Layer Brett movement becomes revolutionary. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 architecture, Layer Brett delivers the speed and cost efficiency that XRP and Cardano communities have been waiting for. While traditional networks process transactions in seconds or minutes, Layer Brett operates at lightning speed with minimal gas fees—solving the exact problems that limit mainstream adoption.</p>\n    <p>The difference lies in approach. XRP and ADA built their solutions as monolithic networks, inheriting the scalability challenges that come with that architecture. Layer Brett leverages proven Layer 2 technology, creating a foundation that scales naturally with demand.</p>\n    <p>What makes this truly special is the community-first mentality driving development. Unlike corporate-controlled projects that prioritize institutional partnerships over user experience, Layer Brett emerges from genuine grassroots enthusiasm. The project combines meme culture energy with serious technical innovation, creating something that feels both accessible and revolutionary.</p>\n    <h2>Why Layer Brett’s 675% staking rewards create true community wealth</h2>\n    <p>Traditional crypto investing often feels passive—buy tokens, watch prices, hope for institutional validation. Layer Brett transforms this experience through active participation that generates real returns. The over 675% staking APY represents more than impressive numbers; it demonstrates how community-driven projects can redistribute wealth directly to supporters rather than institutional intermediaries.</p>\n    <p>Consider the viral potential: meme culture combined with legitimate utility creates unprecedented sharing incentives. XRP and Cardano supporters promote their investments hoping for price appreciation. Layer Brett community members share something more compelling—a project that rewards participation immediately while building toward long-term revolution.</p>\n    <h2>Join the Brett revolution: How our meme-powered Layer 2 ecosystem transforms you from crypto spectator to blockchain pioneer</h2>\n    <p>The opportunity window remains open, but momentum builds daily. <a href=\"https://www.layerbrett.com/\">At $0.0058 per token</a>, early supporters can access genuine Layer 2 innovation before mainstream discovery drives prices higher. This isn’t about following institutional lead—it’s about joining a movement that prioritizes community empowerment over corporate profit.</p>\n    <p>The comparison becomes clear: XRP and Cardano offer institutional validation and steady development progress. Layer Brett offers immediate participation in blockchain’s next evolution. While others celebrate external recognition, the Layer Brett community builds internal value through revolutionary technology and authentic collaboration.</p>\n    <h6>Connect your wallet and buy in today.</h6>\n    <p>Website: <a href=\"https://layerbrett.com\">https://layerbrett.com</a></p>\n    <p>Telegram: <a href=\"https://t.me/layerbrett\">https://t.me/layerbrett</a></p>\n    <p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/LayerBrett\">(1) Layer Brett (@LayerBrett) / X</a></p>\n    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>This is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

    "body": "<p>Ex-staffers testify that RFK Jr. is turning away from science, with potentially dire consequences.</p>\n<p>\n      <i>Update Friday 6am ET: The advisory CDC panel recommended that children under the age of 4 do not receive the combined MMRV vaccine (for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) but instead receive two separate shots.</i>\n    </p>\n<p>This week has been an eventful one for America’s public health agency. Two former leaders of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25vDjs0iy_k\">explained the reasons for their sudden departures from the agency</a> in a Senate hearing. And they described how CDC employees are being instructed to turn their backs on scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>The CDC’s former director Susan Monarez and former chief medical officer Debra Houry took questions from a Senate committee on Wednesday. <strong>They painted a picture of a health agency in turmoil—and at risk of harming the people it is meant to serve.</strong></p>\n<p>On Thursday, an advisory CDC panel that develops vaccine guidance met for a two-day discussion on multiple childhood vaccines. During the meeting, which was underway as <i>The Checkup</i> went to press, members of the panel were set to discuss those vaccines and propose recommendations on their use.</p>\n<p>Monarez worries that access to childhood vaccines is under threat—and that the public health consequences could be dire. “If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return,” she said.</p>\n<p>As the current secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. oversees federal health and science agencies that include the CDC, which monitors and responds to threats to public health. Part of that role involves developing vaccine recommendations.</p>\n<p><strong>As  we’ve noted before, RFK Jr. has long been a prominent critic of vaccines.</strong> He has incorrectly linked commonly used ingredients to autism and made other incorrect statements about risks associated with various vaccines.</p>\n<p>Still, he oversaw the recruitment of Monarez—who does not share those beliefs—to lead the agency. When she was sworn in on July 31, Monarez, who is a microbiologist and immunologist, had already been serving as acting director of the agency. She had held prominent positions at other federal agencies and departments too, including the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-secretary-kennedy-swears-in-susan-monarez-as-cdc-director-to-advance-make-america-healthy-again.html\">described her as “a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials.”</a></p>\n<p><strong>His opinion seems to have changed somewhat since then. </strong>Just 29 days after Monarez took on her position, she was turfed out of the agency. And in yesterday’s hearing, she explained why.</p>\n<p>On August 25, Kennedy asked Monarez to do two things, she said. First, he wanted her to commit to firing scientists at the agency. And second, he wanted her to “pre-commit” to approve vaccine recommendations made by the agency’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), regardless of whether there was any scientific evidence to support those recommendations, she said. “He just wanted blanket approval,” she <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544143/cdc-director-susan-monarez-testimony-rfk\">said during her testimony</a>. </p>\n<p>\n      <strong>She refused both requests.</strong>\n    </p>\n<p>Monarez testified that she didn’t want to get rid of hardworking scientists who played an important role in keeping Americans safe. And she said she could not commit to approving vaccine recommendations without reviewing the scientific evidence behind them and maintain her integrity. She was sacked.</p>\n<p>Those vaccine recommendations are currently under discussion, and scientists like Monarez are worried about how they might change. Kennedy fired all 17 members of the previous committee in June. (Monarez said she was not consulted on the firings and found out about them through media reports.)</p>\n<p><strong>“A clean sweep is needed to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy wrote in  a piece for the </strong>He went on to replace those individuals with eight new members, some of whom have been prominent vaccine critics and </p>\n<p><i>Wall Street Journal</i>at the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76#xd_co_f=OGFkNmQ3ZjItZGE1Ny00ODBiLThjNjktMWM5MzUwOTMyYTA0~\">have spread misinformation about vaccines</a>.

The <a href=\"https://news.aai.org/2025/06/30/reconstituted-cdc-acip-holds-first-meeting/\">meeting</a> included a presentation about thimerosal—a chemical that Kennedy has incorrectly linked to autism, and which is no longer included in vaccines in the US—and a proposal to recommend that the MMRV vaccine (for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) not be offered to children under the age of four.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html\">five new committee members</a> were named. They include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/08/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers/\">individuals who have advocated against vaccine mandates</a> and who have argued that mRNA-based covid vaccines should be removed from the market.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/18/1123844/meeting-vaccine-guidance-former-cdc-leaders-alarmed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "\n  \n    <p>The chemical industry relies on hydrogen, which is typically made using fossil fuels today.Getty Images</p>\n    <p>Hydrogen is sometimes held up as a master key for the energy transition. It can be made using several low-emissions methods and could play a role in cleaning up industries ranging from agriculture and chemicals to aviation and long-distance shipping.</p>\n    <p>This moment is a complicated one for the green fuel, though, as a new report from the International Energy Agency lays out. A number of major projects face cancellations and delays, especially in the US and Europe. The US in particular is seeing a slowdown after changes to key tax credits and cuts in support for renewable energy. Still, there are bright spots for the industry, including in China, and new markets could soon become crucial for growth.</p>\n    <p>Here are three things to know about the state of hydrogen in 2025.</p>\n    <p>1. Expectations for annual clean hydrogen production by 2030 are shrinking, for the first time.</p>\n    <p>While hydrogen has the potential to serve as a clean fuel, today most is made with processes that use fossil fuels. As of 2025, about a million metric tons of low-emissions hydrogen are produced annually. That’s less than 1% of total hydrogen production.</p>\n    <p>In last year’s Global Hydrogen Report, the IEA projected that global production of low-emissions hydrogen would grow to as high as 49 million metric tons annually by 2030. That prediction has been steadily climbing since 2021, as more places around the world sink money into developing and scaling up the technology.</p>\n    <p>In the 2025 edition, though, the IEA’s production prediction had shrunk to 37 million metric tons annually by 2030.</p>\n    <p>That’s still a major expansion from today’s numbers, but it’s the first time the agency has cut its predictions for the end of the decade. The report cited the cancellations of both electrolysis projects (those that use electricity to generate hydrogen) and carbon capture projects as reasons for the pullback. The cancelled and delayed projects included sites across Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Australia.</p>\n    <p>2. China is dominating production today and could produce competitively cheap green hydrogen by the end of the decade.</p>\n    <p>Speaking of electrolysis projects, China is the driving force in manufacturing and development of electrolyzers, the devices that use electricity to generate green hydrogen, according to the new IEA report. As of July 2025, the country accounted for 65% of the installed or almost installed electrolyzer capacity in the world. It also manufactures nearly 60% of the world’s electrolyzers.</p>\n    <p>A major barrier for clean hydrogen today is that dirty methods based on fossil fuels are just so much cheaper than cleaner ones.</p>\n    <p>But China is well on its way to narrowing that gap. Today, it’s roughly three times more expensive to make and install an electrolyzer anywhere else in the world than in China. The country could produce green hydrogen that’s cost-competitive with fossil hydrogen by the end of the decade, according to the IEA report. That could make the fuel an obvious choice for both new and existing uses of hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>3. Southeast Asia could be a major emerging market for low-emissions hydrogen.</p>\n    <p>One region that could become a major player in the green hydrogen market is Southeast Asia. The economy is growing fast, and so is energy demand.</p>\n    <p>There’s an existing market for hydrogen in Southeast Asia already. Today, the region uses about 4 million metric tons of hydrogen annually, largely in the oil refining industry and the chemical business, where it is used to make ammonia and methanol.</p>\n    <p>International shipping is also concentrated in the region—the port of Singapore supplied about one-sixth of all the fuel used in global shipping in 2024, more than any other single location. Today, that total consists almost exclusively of fossil fuels. But there’s been work to test cleaner fuels, including methanol and ammonia, and interest in shifting to hydrogen in the longer term.</p>\n    <p>Clean hydrogen could slot into these existing industries and help cut emissions. There are 25 projects under development right now in the region, though additional support for renewables will be crucial to getting significant capacity up and running.</p>\n    <p>Overall, hydrogen is getting a reality check, revealing problems cutting through the hype we’ve seen in recent years. The next five years will tell whether the fuel can live up to the still-lofty hopes.</p>\n    <p>This article is from The Spark, MIT Technology Review’s weekly climate newsletter.

He looked really, very handsome last night. Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.” </p>\n<p>The president frequently comments on the attractiveness of people he encounters ― from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/central-casting-trump-is-talking-more-than-ever-about-mens-looks\">military servicemen</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/like-someone-from-central-casting-kavanaughs-life-seems-scripted-for-supreme-court/\">judges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/25/donald-trump-often-uses-central-casting-describe-those-around-him/2981978002/\">foreign aides</a> ― often using the term “central casting.” He has even <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-trump-demands-death-penalty/story?id=125436079\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZO7mFAafd/\">described</a> a murdered Ukrainian refugee in terms of her beauty, and <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1965880535659470994\">his social media posts</a> following the death of Charlie Kirk described the slain activist’s widow as “beautiful.”</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Trump is also quick to lob appearance-based insults, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/trump-women-insults.html\">particularly toward women</a>. Just a few of <a href=\"https://theweek.com/politics/things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women\">the many examples</a> include calling Jessica Chastain “not hot,” Stormy Daniels “horseface,” Rosie O’Donnell “fat” and “a pig,” and Bette Midler “extremely unattractive.”</p>\n<p>Although the president isn’t the only person with this compulsion to constantly comment on people’s looks, seeing this fixation from someone at the highest level of government raises bigger questions: What does the tendency to focus on appearance say about someone’s values, worldview and character? And how does this kind of rhetoric, especially from public figures, affect people as individuals and our culture at large?</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>What This Habit Says About Someone</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Many people comment on others’ appearances as a reflection of their own insecurities or societal conditioning,” said <a href=\"https://thriveworks.com/therapist/pa/monica-cwynar\">Monica Cwynar</a>, a licensed clinical social worker with Thriveworks. “This behavior often stems from a need to assert social dominance or align oneself with prevalent beauty standards. It often reveals a lack of self-awareness or acceptance and a reliance on external validation.”</p>\n<p>She emphasized that these kinds of comments can highlight deeper self-esteem issues and a desperate need for approval.</p>\n<p>“Our culture is shaped heavily by white supremacy, capitalism and patriarchy, which trains us to evaluate and rank people visually before anything else,” said mental health therapist <a href=\"https://livinglotustherapy.com/\">Panicha McGuire</a>. “Beauty standards rooted in whiteness, thinness, youth and able-bodiedness are held up as the ‘ideal,’ so people internalize the compulsion to comment on appearance as a way of sorting who is ‘valuable’ and who is not.”</p>\n<p>So while the impulse might seem casual or even harmless, this habit tends to reflect bigger cultural forces and personal anxieties ― making appearance-focused remarks less about the person being observed and more about the speaker’s internalized values and struggles.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it’s an awkward attempt at connection, but often it reveals insecurity, bias or a worldview where worth is tied to conformity with those dominant standards rather than to substance or someone’s character,” McGuire said.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>How Trump’s Fixation On Looks Affects Society And Culture At Large</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“When public figures focus on appearance, they reinforce superficial values within society,” Cwynar said. “When it comes from our leaders, the impact has more gravitas, especially when it is delivered from men about women and their appearance. This behavior can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, create a culture that prioritizes looks over abilities or character and normalize objectification.”</p>\n<p>She believes this phenomenon is evident in the decreased self-esteem among teens today, which she linked to the high value placed on looks on social media and TV.</p>\n<p>“It sends a message that self-worth is contingent upon appearance, influencing how individuals perceive themselves and others,” Cwynar said. “The broader cultural implications include increased anxiety, body image issues and a relentless pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.”</p>\n<p>There’s an even more sinister impact to this kind of rhetoric from world leaders as well.</p>\n<p>“When leaders do this, it reinforces a culture of dehumanization,” McGuire said. “It tells us that the most important thing about a person is whether they fit a narrow ideal of beauty or masculinity. It also distracts from accountability, policy and real issues by keeping the conversation shallow.”</p>\n<p>By centering specific values, this kind of leadership sends a message that those who deviate from those norms should be reduced, ridiculed or erased.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-comment-appearances-habit_n_68cacaace4b0635bf8b66b72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<html>\n  <body>\n    <h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n    <h2>The Commodity Class Is Law</h2>\n    <p>In a market clouded by uncertainty, one truth has already been established: Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies belong to the commodity class.<br/>The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts have ruled repeatedly that Bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC v. McDonnell (2018) decision and CME’s regulated Bitcoin futures contracts leave no doubt — Bitcoin trades under the same legal framework as gold, oil, or wheat.<br/>In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reinforced that status by approving spot Bitcoin ETFs as Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The commodity class isn’t theory — it’s defined law.</p>\n    <graphic src=\"https://cdn.getmidnight.com/13448471d89a9cd8d7f71026a0334ec8/2025/09/POW.jpg\"/>\n    <h2>The Golden Lineage of Proof-of-Work</h2>\n    <p>Bitcoin was the genesis: digital gold with no issuer, no premine, no promises. But the lineage didn’t stop there. Other proof-of-work assets carried forward the same DNA: decentralization, fair mining, and issuance without corporate control.<br/>This is the Golden Lineage — assets that regulators and markets consistently treat as commodities, not securities. And critically, there are only four Proof-of-Work coins launched before 2015 that fully hold to what many call the King’s Law: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Vertcoin. These are the foundation stones of the commodity class.</p>\n    <h2>Litecoin: The Silver Signal</h2>\n    <p>If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. With faster block times and over a decade of survival, Litecoin has proven itself as a foundational proof-of-work asset.<br/>Now, it has stepped into Bitcoin’s regulatory shadow. In 2025, major exchanges filed for spot Litecoin ETFs, explicitly building on Bitcoin’s commodity precedent. This marks Litecoin as the signal — proof that the commodity class is expanding beyond BTC.</p>\n    <h2>Dogecoin: The Cultural Commodity</h2>\n    <p>Dogecoin adds another branch to the lineage. Born as a meme, it evolved into one of the most mined and most traded proof-of-work assets. No premine, no ICO, and a global community have ensured its survival.<br/>Dogecoin demonstrates that even culture-driven coins can achieve commodity status when they are decentralized, mined fairly, and operate without an issuer.</p>\n    <h2>Vertcoin: The Overlooked Heir</h2>\n    <p>This brings us to the hidden gem in Bitcoin’s lineage: <a href=\"https://vertcoin.org\">Vertcoin (VTC)</a>.<br/>Launched in 2014 with no ICO, no premine, and no centralized control, Vertcoin was designed for one mission: true decentralization. Unlike most networks, it remains ASIC-resistant, keeping mining accessible to everyday participants and aligned with Satoshi’s vision of a people-powered network.<br/>By structure, Vertcoin belongs to the same commodity class as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin:<br/>- Proof-of-Work secured<br/>- Decentralized, no issuer promises<br/>- Fair distribution, no premine or ICO<br/>- Recognized trading markets, fungible and uniform<br/>Yet unlike BTC, LTC, and DOGE, Vertcoin trades far below the spotlight. That gap between commodity-class certainty and market recognition is what makes it the golden opportunity.</p>\n    <h2>The Family Tree Is Written — The Advantage Is Hidden</h2>\n    <p>- Bitcoin: defined as a commodity by law and futures markets.<br/>- Litecoin: signaling commodity expansion through ETF filings.<br/>- Dogecoin: the cultural commodity with scale and community.<br/>- Vertcoin: the overlooked heir, built on the same DNA, still waiting for recognition.<br/>Certainty is rare in crypto — Bitcoin and Litecoin have it. Dogecoin proved it culturally. Vertcoin, the fourth member of the pre-2015 lineage that holds the King’s Law, won’t stay hidden forever.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-defined-it-litecoin-etfs-validate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Traditional capitalism is experiencing a profound transformation, one that is redefining the very fabric of global financial systems. At the forefront of this seismic shift is cryptocurrency—a decentralized, borderless, and permissionless paradigm that operates beyond the control of traditional banking infrastructures and central governments. Cryptocurrencies are not just digital assets anymore; they have evolved into foundational elements of an emerging economic order that many are calling <i>Capitalism 2.0</i>.</p>\n<p>This new financial architecture is driven by an ethos of open-source collaboration, decentralized governance, and blockchain-based transparency. Central banks are being challenged by algorithmic stablecoins. Wall Street is competing with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Institutional investment portfolios now include tokens, and venture capital is pouring billions into Web3 projects. As the lines blur between traditional and digital finance, it’s becoming clear that crypto is not a trend—it’s the next evolution of capitalism itself.</p>\n<h2>Investing in the Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is a highly dynamic ecosystem characterized by 24/7 trading hours, immense innovation, and often extreme volatility—all of which create both unparalleled opportunities and substantial risks for investors. The key to navigating this explosive environment lies in understanding its nuances and being able to identify asymmetric investment opportunities before they go mainstream.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin/\"> Bitcoin (BTC)</a> continues to be the gold standard of digital assets. As the first and most secure blockchain, it offers scarcity through its capped supply and attracts interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. </p>\n<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>, with its support for smart contracts and thriving DeFi ecosystem, remains a high-conviction long-term hold. However, the most compelling alpha often lies beyond the blue chips—in emerging sectors and novel protocols.</p>\n<p>Investors today are pouring capital into a range of next-generation projects such as <strong>Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong> that tackle Ethereum’s congestion and high transaction fees. Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync are gaining traction for enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Meanwhile, AI-integrated blockchain platforms like Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are creating synergistic environments where machine learning intersects with secure, decentralized data infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The modular blockchain thesis is another strong narrative capturing investor attention. Networks like Celestia and Cosmos build composable ecosystems where components can be decoupled and customized, enabling faster innovation and higher performance at scale. Combine these with DAO-based governance models, and you're looking at investment potential akin to early-stage tech startups—with added liquidity and community participation.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Market Trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding macro and micro trends in the cryptocurrency space is essential for investors who aim to stay ahead of the curve. Several important movements are currently shaping the landscape, indicating a sustained and widespread integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>\n<p>First, the introduction of <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/bitcoin-etf/\"> Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in multiple jurisdictions marks a milestone in regulatory acceptance. These instruments have opened the door for institutional investment, providing exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct custody. As inflows rise, so does market legitimacy, creating a flywheel effect that enhances mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Another critical trend is the ongoing tokenization of <strong>real-world assets (RWAs)</strong>. From tokenized real estate and equities to fractionalized art and bonds, blockchain technology is making traditionally illiquid assets tradeable in seconds. This unlocks capital efficiency and democratizes access to markets previously reserved for elites.</p>\n<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong> continues to evolve, now moving towards more sustainable yield mechanisms and refined tokenomics. Protocols are focusing on utility-driven staking, insurance against smart contract risks, and integration with real-world data sources through oracles. Additionally, compliance layers are being introduced to satisfy regulatory criteria without compromising decentralization.</p>\n<p><strong>NFTs</strong> are also undergoing a transformation. No longer just speculative art pieces, NFTs are being utilized in gaming ecosystems, intellectual property management, ticketing systems, and even decentralized identity solutions. This diversification is expanding their utility and reducing their volatility over time, making them a more compelling investment segment again.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, as governments and regulators increase their involvement, crypto-native developers are responding with a renewed emphasis on decentralization and censorship resistance. This cat-and-mouse dynamic is driving innovation at a staggering pace—and keeping the market vibrant and investor-focused.</p>\n<h2>Maximizing Profits</h2>\n<p>To generate meaningful profit in the crypto space, investors must move beyond conventional strategies and embrace a contrarian, data-driven approach. Simple buy-and-hold tactics may yield modest returns, but the true potential lies in dynamic allocation, risk hedging, and capital deployment tailored to market cycles.</p>\n<p>One core strategy is adopting a <strong>contrarian mindset</strong>. Profits often emerge from making informed moves when sentiment is at its lowest. History has shown that buying during market capitulations—when “fear” dominates social metrics and sentiment indicators—can yield exponential gains when market confidence returns. Conversely, taking profits during irrational exuberance can protect capital and allow reentry at lower prices.</p>\n<p>Using on-chain analytics tools like Nansen, Glassnode, and Dune Analytics can offer invaluable insights into wallet activity, token supply changes, exchange inflows/outflows, and smart contract interactions. This data-driven approach can uncover accumulation patterns, early project momentum, and whale movements that often precede breakout rallies.</p>\n<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide early access to nascent tokens often before centralized listings. By utilizing liquidity pools, you can engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and token staking—but always with a security-first mindset. Smart contract auditing, impermanent loss mitigation, and thorough whitepaper evaluation are essential to prevent common pitfalls.</p>\n<p>Adopting strategies like <strong>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> into high-conviction assets during bearish periods allows investors to manage risk while building exposure gradually. Periodic rebalancing of the portfolio in bull markets can help lock in gains and maintain a diversified risk profile.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/crypto-capitalism-2-profit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>In an economic landscape marred by rising inflation and diminishing real returns from traditional financial instruments, crypto presents a disruptive alternative for savvy investors—<strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong>. These assets are far more than just digital representations of the U.S. dollar; they are engineered on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to <i>generate ongoing, passive income</i> with minimal price volatility. As we move into 2025, yield-bearing stablecoins are becoming a transformative force, enabling individuals to monetize idle liquidity without the red tape of conventional banking systems. With a few clicks, investors can earn real yield while retaining the dollar-peg stability they trust—this is income on autopilot, redefined for the digital age.</p>\n<h2>The Growing Importance of Passive Income</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newcomer, one investing truth remains evergreen: <strong>the power of passive income compounds over time</strong>. This principle becomes even more essential during extended bear markets, where portfolio prices fall, market sentiment nosedives, and liquidity becomes elusive. Traditional strategies often falter under such conditions, but passive income allows investors to weather volatility by providing steady, reliable returns.</p>\n<p>Yield-bearing stablecoins address this need elegantly. They offer a mechanism to earn yield without the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In downturns, when price action becomes unpredictable or outright hostile, predictable earnings from these digital instruments serve as a stabilizing force. Whether you're taking a conservative approach or diversifying across high-risk altcoins, passive income can cushion losses and even provide a basis for reinvestment. In fact, some of the most profitable DeFi portfolios have been carved out and grown during periods when the rest of the market stalled or retraced.</p>\n<h2>What Are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?</h2>\n<p>To understand their value, we need to differentiate basic stablecoins from their yield-generating cousins. Standard stablecoins like USDC and USDT simply act as blockchain-based representations of fiat currency. They are typically used for transfers, trading, or holding value. However, they offer <i>zero yield</i>—unless manually deployed into DeFi yield farms, lending platforms, or liquidity pools. That’s where <strong>yield-bearing stablecoins</strong> redefine the model.</p>\n<p>Examples like <strong>yETH</strong> from Yearn Finance, <strong>aUSDC</strong> issued by Aave, and <strong>sDAI</strong> via Spark Protocol accumulate interest directly from underlying strategies. When you hold these tokens, you participate in lending markets, staking mechanisms, or automated DeFi strategies without doing the heavy lifting yourself. These assets are programmatically designed to capture yield from verified DeFi sources and automatically rebalance for maximum efficiency. There is no need for staking, locking periods, or gas-intensive interaction with smart contracts. These stablecoins offer set-it-and-forget-it convenience.</p>\n<p>Because their earnings are embedded in the token design, yield-bearing stablecoins also benefit from composability across protocols. They can be used as collateral, integrated into vaults, or supplied to other apps where they continue earning—turning one financial position into a multitasking income engine.</p>\n<h2>Key Factors That Influence Yield Generation</h2>\n<p>Not all yield-bearing stablecoins are created equal. The source and sustainability of the yield, along with other macro and technical indicators, greatly affect how much you can earn and how secure your position really is.</p>\n<ul>\n      <li><strong>Protocol Risk:</strong>The foundational risk rests within the protocol generating the yield. Is the core revenue derived from lending, validator staking, or liquidity provision? Or is it based on inflationary token emissions that could dry up overnight? Sustainable yield comes from value-generating activity, not financial engineering.</li>\n      <li><strong>Adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL):</strong>A higher TVL often signals trust and usage volume but can also compress yields as more users chase limited returns. Conversely, emerging protocols may offer higher APYs but carry greater implementation or security risk.</li>\n      <li><strong>Smart Contract Optimization:</strong>Yield-bearing stablecoins rely on automation, and the quality of the smart contracts determines performance. Solutions that include real-time rebalancing, adaptive fee routing, and smart reinvestment strategies usually outperform more static alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Asset Backing and Transparency:</strong>Some tokens are fully collateralized with high-grade assets or deploy clear rate models with strong reserves. Others mix loose asset backing with speculative tokenomics—often hiding risks. Thorough due diligence is not optional; smart investors demand clarity, particularly in hectic markets.</li>\n    </ul>\n<p>In sum, reliable passive income is about both yield and risk. An attractive APY means little if capital is at risk due to an insecure or mismanaged platform.</p>\n<h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p>Despite the appeal of passive earnings, <strong>there are risks involved</strong>. Soft rugs, smart contract exploits, protocol governance failures, and depegging events can all significantly impact returns—or wipe them out entirely. Yield-bearing stablecoins may appear stable on the surface but often carry hidden systemic risk.</p>\n<p>For example, some protocols incentivize users with their native tokens—boosting APYs temporarily without a true revenue source. When those juicy rewards disappear, so does your yield. Others rely on overly leveraged strategies that can unwind during black swan events. Additionally, many platforms lack open auditing, limiting users’ ability to verify where yield truly originates.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/contrarian-investor/\">contrarian investing</a> becomes powerful. Smart investors dig past the buzz, analyze fundamentals, and form independent theses. They test and question token mechanics, examine revenue models, and utilize risk-adjusted positions. In the realm of passive DeFi income, healthy skepticism is a strength, not a limitation.</p>\n<h2>The Regulatory Landscape</h2>\n<p>The legal outlook for yield-bearing stablecoins remains murky, particularly in the United States. Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and CFTC are increasingly focused on whether interest-generating crypto assets should be considered securities or banking products. This has led to lawsuits, settlements, and more cautious behavior from larger protocol teams.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://altcoininvestor.com/passive-income-stablecoins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>Can AI create a life form? These “generative” genomes are a start</p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can draw cat pictures and write emails. Now the same technology can compose a working genome.</p>\n<p>A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses—and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.</p>\n<p>The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the “the first generative design of complete genomes.”</p>\n<p>The work, described in a <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.12.675911v1\">preprint paper</a>, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an “impressive first step” toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by <i>MIT Technology Review</i>.  </p>\n<p>Boeke says the AI’s performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. “They saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,” he says.</p>\n<p>This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That’s because viruses are not alive. They’re more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes.</p>\n<p>In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria—called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters.</p>\n<p>To do so, they used two versions of an <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/generative-ai-tool-marks-a-milestone-in-biology\">AI called Evo</a>, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses.</p>\n<p>But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with <i>E. coli</i> bacteria.</p>\n<p>That led to a profound “AI is here” moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.</p>\n<p>“That was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,” says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out.</p>\n<p>Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working—that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them.</p>\n<p>J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2010/08/25/200992/how-to-remake-life/\">organisms with lab-made DNA</a> nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”</p>\n<p>For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. “We did the manual AI version—combing through the literature, taking what was known,” he says.</p>\n<p>But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/\">claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024</a> for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses<strong>. </strong>For instance, doctors have sometimes tried “phage therapy” to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria.</p>\n<p>“There is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,” says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei’s lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients’ bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones.</p>\n<p>The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven’t taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists—out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice—could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality.</p>\n<p>“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it’s random so you don’t know what you are getting,” says Venter. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/17/1123801/ai-virus-bacteriophage-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Experts in political science warn that such an outcome would not be peaceful ― and that Greene’s proposal is alarming. </p>\n<p>On Monday, Greene <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1967550436337996189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1967550436337996189%7Ctwgr%5Edc858c3d67e6e94404a1fcf081db4013d5c32aae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmarjorie-taylor-greene-national-divorce_n_68c86433e4b04bfe9a6f3814\">shared a lengthy post</a> on X, formerly Twitter, dangerously blaming people on the left for Kirk’s death, saying “millions” of liberal-leaning people were celebrating it. Many <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/republican-party\">Republicans</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlie-kirk-they-killed-him_n_68c87873e4b04bfe9a6f63bb?origin=home-zone-d-unit\">had rushed to publicly blame Democrats </a>for Kirk’s death, even while the search for a suspect was still underway — and despite the fact that both people on the left and the right have been subjected to political violence and threats in recent years. </p>\n<p>“There is nothing left to talk about with the left. They hate us. They assassinated our nice guy who actually talked to them peacefully, debating ideas,” Greene said of Kirk. “Then millions on the left celebrated and made clear they want all of us dead.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i/>\n      <i>Decisions in Washington don’t just stay in Washington — they shape lives everywhere.

Our country is too far gone and too far divided, and it’s no longer safe for any of us,” she continued, before adding: “Tighten your circle around your family and protect them at all times. I will pray for the left, but personally I want nothing to do with them.”</p>\n<p>Greene has called for a national divorce before. Back in 2021, the congresswoman suggested that people moving from blue states to red states should have a “cooling off period” before they’re able to vote.</p>\n<p>“All possible in a National Divorce scenario. After Democrat voters and big donors ruin a state like California, you would think it wise to stop them from doing it to another great state like Florida,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1476226398540816390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1476226398540816390%7Ctwgr%5E7d4e0e121359c42fee32adeffd8fd8de83b8f362%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2FTKkBA9X%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1\">wrote on X</a> at the time. “Brainwashed people that move from CA and NY really need a cooling off period.”</p>\n<p>And in 2023, she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1627665203398688768\">wrote on X </a>that “we need a national divorce” and that “everyone I talk to says this.” </p>\n<p>She added, “From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the [<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/democratic-party\">Democrats</a>’] traitorous America Last policies, we are done.”</p>\n<p>When Greene called for a national divorce in 2021, political commentator and journalist Mehdi Hasan called her out at the time in a TV segment on his then-network <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/msnbc\">MSNBC</a>, calling her a <a href=\"https://x.com/allinwithchris/status/1476730274260168733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">“serious threat to democracy.” </a></p>\n<p>Hasan pointed out that Greene, who represents Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, comes from a state that “tried a national divorce in the 1860s.”</p>\n<p>“Why? Georgia<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/causes-of-the-civil-war/\"> wanted to keep the institution of slavery</a>,” he said at the time. Georgia was the fifth out of the 11 Southern states to secede from the Union, following the election of President Abraham Lincoln. The Civil War followed.</p>\n<p>While Greene’s tweet on Monday called for a “peaceful” national divorce, one expert in political science emphasized that such a scenario would not be possible.</p>\n<p>“Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s renewed call for a ‘peaceful national divorce’ underscores a growing belief that red and blue America can no longer coexist,” <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/ryan-griffiths\">Ryan Griffiths</a>, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told HuffPost.</p>\n<p>“History shows such a divorce would not be peaceful,” he continued.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>History has shown that attempts to divide the country have often resulted in violence.</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Griffiths, author of “The Disunited States: Threats of Secession in Red and Blue America and Why They Won’t Work,” told HuffPost that the “idea that irreconcilable differences justify secession ignores the violent history of such efforts, including the Civil War, and overlooks the reality that Americans are deeply intermixed — politically, geographically and ideologically.”</p>\n<p>He said that while polarization is “real and worsening,” the solution is not to separate. It’s to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“Americans share more values than they realize, and it is our political leadership and not the people that is most polarized,” he said. “We need leaders who reject extremism, denounce violence, and work together to heal the divide before the call for divorce becomes a dangerous reality.”</p>\n<p>Griffiths emphasized that the U.S. “lacks the conditions for a clean split.” Then he added, “Any attempt to divide, based on what we’ve seen historically, would trigger cycles of violence, displacement, and lawlessness.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-america-change-experts_n_68c9ab78e4b0765c82509d22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multi-Agent Systems: The Next Frontier in AI-Driven Cyber Defense<br>\nImage by Editor | ChatGPT<br></p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>The increasing sophistication of cyber threats calls for a systemic change in the way we defend ourselves against them. Traditional security solutions, and legacy solutions, function in silos, and often struggle with dynamic and coordinated attacks. Multi-agent systems (MAS), on the other hand, utilize collaboration and agent dependent solutions, which enable a combination of AI agents to work together, mimicking human collaboration, as a “system”, while providing machine speed and scale when enhancing the cybersecurity posture of an organization.</p>\n<h2>The Power of Decentralized, Collaborative AI</h2>\n<p>At the heart of a MAS are many intelligent agents that act together, where agents are software entities capable of autonomous actions. In cyber security, the agents in a multi-agent system are intelligent systems that can observe their environments, arbitrate optimal actions, and act collectively to collaboratively detect, respond and respectively reduce cyber threat risk. AI agents are special because they can dynamically analyze new data or context from their investigations and autonomously adapt their actions based on similarities and growth, as they can presumably synthesised large amounts of information across multiple domains and generally develop from experimentation.</p>\n<p>The main advantages of using MAS in cybersecurity include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scalability: Agents can be added or removed at will and, because of this, MAS can be more easily scaled to a diverse range of network sizes and complexities from small businesses to huge enterprises\n</li><li>Adaptability: Agents adapt to new data points, in that they can learn and adjust their algorithms for detection and response, they can adapt to new data without human intervention, allowing organizations to have a strong (proactive) defence against threats which evolve\n</li><li>Fault Tolerant: Failures in one agent do not prevent other agents from operating leading to guaranteed continued protection and resilience\n</li><li>Collaboration: Agents share information and coordinate responses, resulting in faster mitigation, fewer false positives, and a larger understanding of the threat landscape and increased situational awareness\n</li></ul>\n<h2>Practical Applications in Cyber Defense</h2>\n<p>Multi-Agent Systems are already revolutionizing security operations in several key areas:</p>\n<h3>Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (DIDS)</h3>\n<p>Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) typically offer a centralized approach to analysis, which can lead to latencies, or possible delays. With MAS, DIDS allow agents to monitor their own slice of the network in isolation, but share information to make sense of how seemingly coordinated attacks across multiple network segments occurred. For example, one agent may identify suspicious traffic patterns around a server, while another agent may relate this suspicious activity to anomalous user logins on a different endpoint, which collectively points to a multi-stage attack.</p>\n<h3>Automated Incident Response</h3>\n<p>MAS has the potential to automate complex incident response processes, and potentially prevent delays in incident response by allowing agents to perform the appropriate response tasks without the need for human intervention. Agents can be assigned to isolate infected machines, block suspicious IP’s, quarantine files, or roll back compromised configurations. This capability can reduce incident response time to minutes; ultimately preventing an attacker from harming even more systems. For example, an AI agent may identify a malware, analyze it, identify how it propagates, and could easily instruct agents to block its network connections, quarantine affected machines, etc.</p>\n<h3>Threat Intelligence Sharing</h3>\n<p>Agents in an MAS environment can also use communication and real-time threat intelligence from other agents that are leveraging external databases, threat intelligence platforms or other MAS deployments. It has collective defense capabilities which enhances an organizations’ capabilities to spot, understand, and defend against current or emerging threats while they are still forming into attacks by creating a “common picture” of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures.</p>\n<h3>Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)</h3>\n<p>The multifaceted nature of multi-cloud environments poses enormous challenges for security teams. AI agents may be able to assess the context of alerts produced by CSPM tools and prioritize high-risk misconfigurations, and in some cases, autonomously remediate the issues by updating infrastructure-as-code or raising a pull request for the human user. AI agents can also understand the correlation of data across multiple cloud providers and offer a coherent and unified security posture.</p>\n<h3>The Human-Agent Collaboration</h3>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-agent-systems-the-next-frontier-in-ai-driven-cyber-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Meanwhile, the precision-recall (PR) curve plots precision against recall for different thresholds, focusing on analyzing performance for positive class predictions. Therefore, it is particularly useful and informative for comprehensively evaluating classifiers trained on imbalanced datasets. The ROC curve, on the other hand, is less sensitive to class imbalance, being more suitable for evaluating classifiers built on rather balanced datasets, as well as in scenarios where the real-world cost of false positive and false negative predictions is similar.</p>\n<p>In sum, back to the PR curve and class imbalance datasets, in high-stakes scenarios where correctly identifying positive-class instances is crucial (e.g. identifying the presence of a disease in a patient), the PR curve is a more reliable measure of the classifier’s performance. </p>\n<p>On a more visual note, if we plot both curves alongside each other, we should get an increasing curve in the case of ROC and a decreasing curve in the case of PR. The closer the ROC curve gets to the (0,1) point, meaning the highest TPR and the lowest FPR, the better; whereas the closer the PR curve gets to the (1,1) point, meaning both precision and recall are at their maximum, the better. In both bases, getting closer to these “perfect model points” means the area under the curve or AUC becomes maximum: this is the numerical value we will seek in the examples that follow.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example ROC curve and precision-recall curve<br>\nImage by Author<br></p>\n<p>To illustrate the use and comparison between ROC AUC and precision-recall (PR curve for short), we will consider three datasets with different levels of class imbalance: from mildly to highly imbalanced.

One of the most well-established validation approaches is <strong>cross-validation</strong>, which splits the dataset into several subsets, called folds, and iteratively trains on some of them while testing on the rest. While scikit-learn offers standard components and functions to perform cross-validation the traditional way, several additional tricks can make the process more efficient, insightful, or flexible.</p>\n<p>This article reveals seven of these tricks, along with code examples of their implementation. The code examples below use the scikit-learn library, so make sure it is imported.</p>\n<p>I recommend that you first acquaint yourself with the basics of cross-validation by checking out <a href=\"https://www.statology.org/complete-guide-cross-validation/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>. Also, for a quick refresher, a basic cross-validation implementation (no tricks yet!) in scikit-learn would look like this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">datasets </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">load_iris</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-2\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-3\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">linear_model </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-i\">LogisticRegression</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-4\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-5\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">load_iris</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">return_X_y</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-t\">True</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-6\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-7\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">LogisticRegression</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">max_iter</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">200</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-8\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-9\"><span class=\"crayon-p\"># Basic cross-validation strategy with k=5 folds</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-10\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-11\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-12\"><span class=\"crayon-p\"># Cross validation results: per iteration + aggregated</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-13\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">print</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"Cross-validation scores:\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca37a788346007-14\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">print</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"Mean score:\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">mean</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following examples assume that the basic libraries and functions, like <code>cross_val_score</code>, have already been imported.</p>\n<h2>1.

Shuffled K-fold for Robust Splits</h2>\n<p>By using a <code>KFold</code> object along with the <code>shuffle=True</code> option, we can shuffle instances in the dataset to create more robust splits, thereby preventing accidental bias, especially if the dataset is ordered according to some criterion or the instances are grouped by class label, time, season, etc. It is very simple to apply this strategy:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">KFold</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">KFold</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">n_splits</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">shuffle</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-t\">True</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">random_state</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">42</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca386091212225-4\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3.

Simply assign <code>n_jobs=-1</code> to run the process at the fold level on all available CPU cores. This can result in a significant speed boost, especially when the dataset is large.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca388985696570-1\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">n_jobs</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">-</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">1</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Cross-Validated Predictions</h2>\n<p>By default, using cross-validation in scikit-learn yields the accuracy scores per fold, which are then aggregated into the overall score. If instead we wanted to get predictions for every instance to later build a confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc., we can use <code>cross_val_predict</code> as a substitute for <code>cross_val_score</code>, as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">model_selection </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_predict</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca38a628668707-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">y_pred</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_predict</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. Beyond Accuracy: Custom Scoring</h2>\n<p>It is also possible to replace the default accuracy metric used in cross-validation with other metrics like recall or F1-score. It all depends on the nature of your dataset and your predictive problem’s needs. The <code>make_scorer()</code> function, along with the specific metric (which must also be imported), achieves this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p class=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-plain-wrap\"></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-1\"><span class=\"crayon-e\">from </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">sklearn</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">.</span><span class=\"crayon-e\">metrics </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">import </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">make_scorer</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">recall_score</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-2\"> </p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-3\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">make_scorer</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">average</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-s\">\"macro\"</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-p\"># You can use recall_score too</span></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-line crayon-striped-line\" id=\"urvanov-syntax-highlighter-68cdd2b2ca391282569264-4\"><span class=\"crayon-v\">scores</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-e\">cross_val_score</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">(</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">model</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">X</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">y</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">cv</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-cn\">5</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">,</span><span class=\"crayon-h\"> </span><span class=\"crayon-v\">scoring</span><span class=\"crayon-o\">=</span><span class=\"crayon-v\">f1</span><span class=\"crayon-sy\">)</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6. Leave One Out (LOO) Cross-Validation</h2>\n<p>This strategy is essentially k-fold cross-validation taken to the extreme, providing an exhaustive evaluation for very small datasets. It is a useful strategy mostly for building simpler models on small datasets like the iris one we showed at the beginning of this article, and is generally not advisable for larger datasets or complex models like ensembles, mainly due to the computational cost.

This evolution has enabled them to solve increasingly difficult problems effectively.</p>\n<p>One of the mechanisms that has proven especially influential in the advancement of neural network-based models is <strong>batch normalization</strong>. This article provides a gentle introduction to this strategy, which has become a standard in many modern architectures, helping to improve model performance by stabilizing training, speeding up convergence, and more.</p>\n<h2>How and Why Batch Normalization Was Born?</h2>\n<p>Batch normalization is roughly 10 years old. It was originally proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy in their paper <strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167\" target=\"_blank\">Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The motivation for its creation stemmed from several challenges, including slow training processes and saturation issues like exploding and vanishing gradients. One particular challenge highlighted in the original paper is <strong>internal covariate shift</strong>: in simple terms, this issue is related to how the distribution of inputs to each layer of neurons keeps changing during training iterations, largely because the learnable parameters (connection weights) in the previous layers are naturally being updated during the entire training process. These distribution shifts might trigger a sort of “chicken and egg” problem, as they force the network to keep readjusting itself, sometimes leading to unduly slow and unstable training.</p>\n<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>\n<p>In response to the aforementioned issue, <strong>batch normalization</strong> was proposed as a method that<strong> normalizes the inputs to layers</strong> in a neural network, helping stabilize the training process as it progresses.</p>\n<p>In practice, batch normalization entails introducing an additional normalization step before the assigned activation function is applied to weighted inputs in such layers, as shown in the diagram below.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">How Batch Normalization Works<br>\nImage by Author<br></p>\n<p>In its simplest form, the mechanism consists of <strong>zero-centering, scaling, and shifting the inputs</strong> so that values stay within a more consistent range. This simple idea helps the model learn an optimal scale and mean for inputs at the layer level. Consequently, gradients that flow backward to update weights during backpropagation do so more smoothly, reducing side effects like sensitivity to the weight initialization method, e.g., He initialization. And most importantly, this mechanism has proven to facilitate faster and more reliable training.</p>\n<p>At this point, two typical questions may arise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Why the “batch” in batch normalization?</strong>: If you are fairly familiar with the basics of training neural networks, you may know that the training set is partitioned into mini-batches — typically containing 32 or 64 instances each — to speed up and scale the optimization process underlying training. Thus, the technique is so named because the mean and variance used for normalization of weighted inputs are not calculated over the entire training set, but rather at the batch level.</li>\n<li><strong>Can it be applied to all layers in a neural network?</strong>: Batch normalization is normally applied to the hidden layers, which is where activations can destabilize during training. Since raw inputs are usually normalized beforehand, it is rare to apply batch normalization in the input layer. Likewise, applying it to the output layer is counterproductive, as it may break the assumptions made for the expected range for the output’s values, especially for instance in regression neural networks for predicting aspects like flight prices, rainfall amounts, and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A major positive impact of batch normalization is a strong reduction in the vanishing gradient problem. It also provides more robustness, reduces sensitivity to the chosen weight initialization method, and introduces a regularization effect. This regularization helps combat overfitting, sometimes eliminating the need for other specific strategies like dropout.</p>\n<h2>How to Implement it in Keras</h2>\n<p>Keras is a popular Python API on top of TensorFlow used to build neural network models, where designing the architecture is an essential step before training. This example shows how simple it is to implement batch normalization in a simple neural network to be trained with Keras:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"crayon-info\"></p>\n<p

The study is a position paper that lays out several insightful postulates about the potential of <strong>small language models</strong> (SLMs) to drive innovation in <strong>agentic AI systems</strong>, compared to their larger counterparts, the LLMs, which are currently the predominant component fueling modern agentic AI solutions in organizations.</p>\n<p>A couple of quick definitions before we jump into the paper:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Agentic AI systems</strong> are autonomous systems capable of reasoning, planning, making decisions, and acting in complex and dynamic environments. Recently, this paradigm, which has been investigated for decades, has gained renewed attention due to its significant potential and impact when used alongside state-of-the-art language models and other cutting-edge AI-driven applications. You can find a list of <strong>10 Agentic AI Key Terms Explained</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/10-agentic-ai-key-concepts-explained\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Language models</strong> are natural language processing (NLP) solutions trained on large datasets of text to perform a variety of language understanding and language generation tasks, including text generation and completion, question-answering, text classification, summarization, translation, and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout this article, we will distinguish between small language models (SLMs) — those “small” enough to run efficiently on end-consumer hardware— and large language models (LLMs) — which are much larger and usually require cloud infrastructure. At times, we will simply use “language models” to refer to both from a more general perspective.</p>\n<h2>Authors’ Position</h2>\n<p>The article opens by highlighting the increasing relevance of agentic AI systems and their significant level of adoption by organizations today, usually in a symbiotic relationship with language models. State-of-the-art solutions, however, traditionally rely on LLMs due to their deep, general reasoning capabilities and their broad knowledge, gained from being trained on vast datasets.</p>\n<p>This “status quo” and assumption that LLMs are the universal go-to approach for integration into agentic AI systems is precisely what the authors challenge through their position: they suggest <strong>shifting some attention to SLMs that</strong>, despite their smaller size compared to LLMs, <strong>could be a better approach for agentic AI in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and system adaptability</strong>.</p>\n<p>Some key views underpinning the claim that SLMs, rather than LLMs, are “the future of agentic AI” are summarized below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SLMs are sufficiently powerful to undertake most current agentic tasks\n</li><li>SLMs are better suited for modular agentic AI architectures\n</li><li>SLMs’ deployment and maintenance are more feasible\n</li></ul>\n<p>The paper further elaborates on these views with the following arguments:</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Aptitude for Agentic Tasks</h3>\n<p>Several arguments are provided to support this view. One is based on empirical evidence that SLM performance is rapidly improving, with models like Phi-2, Phi-3, SmoILM2, and more, reporting promising results. On another note, as AI agents are typically instructed to excel at a limited range of language model capabilities, properly fine-tuned SLMs should often be appropriate for most domain-specific applications, with the added benefits of efficiency and flexibility.</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Suitability for Agentic AI Architectures</h3>\n<p>The small size and reduced pre-training and fine-tuning costs of SLMs make them easier to accommodate in typically modular agentic AI architectures and easier to adapt to ever-evolving user needs, behaviors, and requirements. Meanwhile, a well-fine-tuned SLM for selected domain-specific prompt sets can be sufficient for specialized systems and settings, although LLMs will generally have a broader understanding of language and the world as a whole. On another note, as AI agents frequently interact with code, conformance to certain formatting requirements is also a concern to ensure consistency. Consequently, SLMs trained with narrower formatting specifications would be preferable.</p>\n<p>The heterogeneity inherent in agentic systems and interactions is another reason why SLMs are argued to be more suitable for agentic architectures, as these interactions serve as a pathway to gather data.</p>\n<h3>SLMs’ Economic Feasibility</h3>\n<p>SLM flexibility can be easily translated into a higher potential for democratization. The aforementioned reduced operational costs are a major reason for this. In more economic terms, the paper compares SLMs against LLMs concerning inference efficiency, fine-tuning agility, edge deployment, and parameter usage: aspects in which SLMs are considered superior.</p>\n<h2>Alternative Views, Barriers, and Discussion</h2>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://machinelearningmastery.com/small-language-models-are-the-future-of-agentic-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
