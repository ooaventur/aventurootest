    "body": "<p>Everyone online is searching for “free speech” right now.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google\">Google</a> Trends <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=free%20speech&amp;hl=en\">data</a> of the past 30 days, searches for “free speech” have skyrocketed since conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination on a college campus ― and there have been many reasons for it over the past few days. </p>\n<p>There’s Kirk’s death to begin with. The late conservative activist advocated on behalf of free speech, and then was killed while speaking on a college campus. And the reactions to his death are also raising First Amendment concerns as pilots, teachers, and many other workers across America have been <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/url-charlie-kirk-people-fired-free-speech_l_68c86e62e4b00ea64839c70e\">getting doxxed</a> and losing their jobs for sharing their opinions about his death. </p>\n<p>Now, most recently, the latest target has been late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.</p>\n<p>“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">Kimmel said</a> in his Monday show. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr said that Kimmel’s comments were part of a “concerted effort to lie to the American people,” and he threatened penalties for ABC if it didn’t take action to discipline Kimmel for his comments.</p>\n<p>“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/brendan-carr-abc-fcc-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-1236522406/\">said</a> on a right-wing podcast.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, ABC swiftly <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk_n_68cb3778e4b0a2e5bdc6f10b\">said</a> it was suspending “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” indefinitely. President <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> celebrated the news, congratulating “ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” on a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/topic/truth-social\">Truth Social</a> post, which then got reposted on the official White House <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DOuSQCrjxAE/?hl=en\">account</a>. </p>\n<p>So it’s no surprise that one of the top online Google searches right now is free speech related to Jimmy Kimmel, because his firing is especially alarming to free speech experts.</p>\n<p>“Now people are going to be even more hesitant to speak,” said Mark A. Graber, a regents professor of law at the University of Maryland, and a leading scholar on constitutional law and politics. “The way a society drifts from a democracy to a competitive authoritarian regime is not in one blow, but lots of drips.”</p>\n<p>Graber said ABC’s actions will make it easier for other businesses to do the same with speech they do not like.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>Why So Many People Are Searching To Understand ‘Free Speech’ Right Now</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Kimmel’s suspension raises First Amendment concerns because of the government’s involvement. Carr’s words, at minimum, imply that regulatory action might depend on how a company responds to Kimmel’s remarks, said Adam Steinbaugh, senior attorney for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.</p>\n<p>“If Carr had said nothing, had done nothing, and ABC said, ‘You know what? Jimmy Kimmel, we don’t like what you said. We’re going to pull you off the air’ –– that’s not a First Amendment problem. That might be a cultural free speech issue, but it’s not a legal First Amendment issue,” Steinbaugh said. But because of Carr’s involvement, “Now it’s a First Amendment problem,” he said.</p>\n<p>That’s because the Supreme Court has unanimously <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/supreme-court/national-rifle-association-v-vullo\">ruled</a> that “what the government can’t do through direct action, it can’t do through coercion either,” Steinbaugh said, citing the 2024 National Rifle Association v. Vullo case. </p>\n<p>What might also be causing more confusion for people this week is how a key member of the Trump administration is interpreting the First Amendment. Attorney General Pam Bondi recently said the administration plans to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/pam-bondi-first-amendment-hate-speech-prosecution-00566424\">broadly target “hate speech”</a> centered around Kirk ― even though the Supreme Court has <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/hate-speech-protected-first-amendment\">found</a> no general exception for offensive, repugnant or hateful expression. Bondi later walked back her statements. </p>\n<p>The First Amendment doesn’t protect everything you say, though. Hateful speech is not protected when a person’s words incite imminent lawless action or threaten serious bodily harm, for example.</p>\n<p>Steinbaugh said that in the wake of Kirk’s death, he would hope that “as a nation, we would have a renewed commitment to say, ‘All right, there is speech out there that we don’t like or that people might find deeply offensive, but the solution can’t be violence and the solution can’t be state censorship,’” he said.</p>\n<p>“Instead, it seems like... what’s happening is even more questions around free speech being raised,’” he said. “We are right now, I think, making the nation less educated about the First Amendment and about free speech as we go through a period of social and political turmoil.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-google_n_68cc0dd3e4b0aa8d99fe85fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

I also completed an online master’s in statistics through my state school, which my company reimbursed me $2,984 for (about a fifth of the cost).</p>\n<p><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br/></strong>As I’ve grown older, we’re having more conversations about money. My maternal grandfather passed last year and it unearthed a lot of trauma on my mom’s side. My mom has been the one caring for my grandparents, both financially and in terms of managing their medical appointments, shopping for groceries, and even ordering an electric stair lift after my grandma had a fall. It was incredibly painful watching my aunts call my mom selfish for wanting to stop life-prolonging measures for my grandpa, something his care team advocated for, too. I spent many nights trying to comfort him as he choked on mucus, translating to Chinese whatever the nurses were doing to him, just in case he could hear. Now that grandpa has passed, the sisterly conversations have turned towards who will manage and pay for my grandma’s care.</p>\n<p><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br/></strong>I was a peer tutor in sixth grade, making $1.50 an hour.

It also brings in Libra season, a period of harmony and justice. </p>\n<p>Connect with nature during the equinox to align with the universe's rhythms. Take a long walk outside and soak up the energy the earth provides. It’ll be worth our while, as we can feel a rush of positivity and excitement for what’s to come in the months ahead. </p>\n<p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p>\n<h3>Aries</h3>\n<p>You are a fighter, but now you're becoming more of a lover.

The cosmos is offering us a moment of reprieve, something we haven't had in a long time. Now, we can sit back and plan our fall easily, knowing that the best is yet to come.<p>The sun will be in an airy Venusian sign, so we will be inclined to spend our days and nights socializing and even </p><a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch\">hitting up dating apps</a>to find a new crush. If you're in a relationship, you'll find that Venus’s movement into Libra, which begins on October 13th, is a prime time to deepen the bond. Plan a getaway together to take photos of the<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/propaganda-trend-social-media-problem\">foliage for social media</a>. Unattached? Hit the road with friends and upload the pics to your Hily profile.<p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Beware of the Supermoon in Aries on October 6th. We might believe in the goodness of others too much, so we become blindsided by who they are. The lesson is to trust your instincts. Even though we'll want to intellectualize and make excuses for them (a tendency brought on by Libra energy), we must be real and honest about matters. Yes, this does include our own actions. Listen to the voice within or the advice you're given now. The universe is trying to protect you and have your back, so pay attention. If people want to be shady, that’s on them. Know that you don’t have to play games and can maturely walk away.</p><p>The flip side is that another might consume us so much that we forget our obligations. Since the sun is in Libra, no one wants to be a bad pal who doesn't give their besties enough attention. The situation is easy to overcome; you only have to acknowledge the issue and apologize. Like I said before, Libra season is drama-free. Even the most frustrating moments aren't awful… as long as we deal with matters ASAP and move forward. </p><p>The best way to get through Libra season is to celebrate all that life has to offer. Honor the past, present, and future. You’ll be happy that you took time out of your schedule to do so, because the year is almost ending, and it's important to commemorate the small wins. You only get one chance to embrace the sweetness of fall and this is it! </p><p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p><h4>Important Astrological Dates for Libra Season:</h4><p><strong>September 22nd:</strong>The sun enters Libra the same day as the autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, igniting our spirits with bliss.</p><p><strong>October 6th:</strong>Mercury dives into Scorpio, urging us to suss out the truth. For the next few weeks, we’ll take on the role as an investigator, searching for wisdom and insight.</p><p><strong>October 6th:</strong>The Super Full Moon in Aries, known as the Hunter’s Moon, ignites our desires. It will be a spicy time for us to get our passions going. The sparky and fiery energy within burns bright due to the Supermoon in Aries.</p><p><strong>October 13th:</strong>Venus moves into tender Libra, heightening the desire for romance. Write a love letter, send flowers, or serenade that special person. For the daring peeps, go on an adventure with your crew. Relish the seasonal beauty and the breeze in your hair.</p><p><strong>October 21st:</strong>The New Moon in Libra encourages us to commit to a financial plan or a relationship. The caveat is that we might rush matters instead of letting them occur naturally. The heart wants what the heart wants.</p><p><strong>October 22nd:</strong>Neptune retrograde swims back into Pisces, highlighting mid-March. Think about how your dreams have evolved and what you wish to attain. You can also revisit creative ventures from the past and transform them into greatness.</p><p>AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT</p></body>\n</html>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

    "body": "<p>When President <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a> greeted the Prince and Princess of Wales on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-kate-middleton-beautiful_n_68cab37ce4b0c377dc20fb61\">he immediately commented</a> on Kate Middleton’s looks.</p>\n<p>“You’re beautiful, so beautiful,” he told the royal.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t an isolated moment. Trump has a long history of leading with remarks about how others look. After meeting with Prince William in Paris last year, he <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2024/12/08/world-news/trump-gushes-over-very-handsome-prince-william-after-paris-meeting-some-people-look-better-in-person/\">told the New York Post</a>, “He’s a good-looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night. Some people look better in person? He looked great. He looked really nice, and I told him that.” </p>\n<p>The president frequently comments on the attractiveness of people he encounters ― from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/central-casting-trump-is-talking-more-than-ever-about-mens-looks\">military servicemen</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/like-someone-from-central-casting-kavanaughs-life-seems-scripted-for-supreme-court/\">judges</a> to <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/25/donald-trump-often-uses-central-casting-describe-those-around-him/2981978002/\">foreign aides</a> ― often using the term “central casting.” He has even <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/charlotte-light-rail-stabbing-trump-demands-death-penalty/story?id=125436079\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOZO7mFAafd/\">described</a> a murdered Ukrainian refugee in terms of her beauty, and <a href=\"https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1965880535659470994\">his social media posts</a> following the death of Charlie Kirk described the slain activist’s widow as “beautiful.”</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Trump is also quick to lob appearance-based insults, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/trump-women-insults.html\">particularly toward women</a>. Just a few of <a href=\"https://theweek.com/politics/things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women\">the many examples</a> include calling Jessica Chastain “not hot,” Stormy Daniels “horseface,” Rosie O’Donnell “fat” and “a pig,” and Bette Midler “extremely unattractive.”</p>\n<p>Although the president isn’t the only person with this compulsion to constantly comment on people’s looks, seeing this fixation from someone at the highest level of government raises bigger questions: What does the tendency to focus on appearance say about someone’s values, worldview and character? And how does this kind of rhetoric, especially from public figures, affect people as individuals and our culture at large?</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>What This Habit Says About Someone</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“Many people comment on others’ appearances as a reflection of their own insecurities or societal conditioning,” said <a href=\"https://thriveworks.com/therapist/pa/monica-cwynar\">Monica Cwynar</a>, a licensed clinical social worker with Thriveworks. “This behavior often stems from a need to assert social dominance or align oneself with prevalent beauty standards. It often reveals a lack of self-awareness or acceptance and a reliance on external validation.”</p>\n<p>She emphasized that these kinds of comments can highlight deeper self-esteem issues and a desperate need for approval.</p>\n<p>“Our culture is shaped heavily by white supremacy, capitalism and patriarchy, which trains us to evaluate and rank people visually before anything else,” said mental health therapist <a href=\"https://livinglotustherapy.com/\">Panicha McGuire</a>. “Beauty standards rooted in whiteness, thinness, youth and able-bodiedness are held up as the ‘ideal,’ so people internalize the compulsion to comment on appearance as a way of sorting who is ‘valuable’ and who is not.”</p>\n<p>So while the impulse might seem casual or even harmless, this habit tends to reflect bigger cultural forces and personal anxieties ― making appearance-focused remarks less about the person being observed and more about the speaker’s internalized values and struggles.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it’s an awkward attempt at connection, but often it reveals insecurity, bias or a worldview where worth is tied to conformity with those dominant standards rather than to substance or someone’s character,” McGuire said.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>How Trump’s Fixation On Looks Affects Society And Culture At Large</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>“When public figures focus on appearance, they reinforce superficial values within society,” Cwynar said. “When it comes from our leaders, the impact has more gravitas, especially when it is delivered from men about women and their appearance. This behavior can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, create a culture that prioritizes looks over abilities or character and normalize objectification.”</p>\n<p>She believes this phenomenon is evident in the decreased self-esteem among teens today, which she linked to the high value placed on looks on social media and TV.</p>\n<p>“It sends a message that self-worth is contingent upon appearance, influencing how individuals perceive themselves and others,” Cwynar said. “The broader cultural implications include increased anxiety, body image issues and a relentless pursuit of unrealistic beauty standards.”</p>\n<p>There’s an even more sinister impact to this kind of rhetoric from world leaders as well.</p>\n<p>“When leaders do this, it reinforces a culture of dehumanization,” McGuire said. “It tells us that the most important thing about a person is whether they fit a narrow ideal of beauty or masculinity. It also distracts from accountability, policy and real issues by keeping the conversation shallow.”</p>\n<p>By centering specific values, this kind of leadership sends a message that those who deviate from those norms should be reduced, ridiculed or erased.</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-comment-appearances-habit_n_68cacaace4b0635bf8b66b72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"

Experts in political science warn that such an outcome would not be peaceful ― and that Greene’s proposal is alarming. </p>\n<p>On Monday, Greene <a href=\"https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1967550436337996189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1967550436337996189%7Ctwgr%5Edc858c3d67e6e94404a1fcf081db4013d5c32aae%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmarjorie-taylor-greene-national-divorce_n_68c86433e4b04bfe9a6f3814\">shared a lengthy post</a> on X, formerly Twitter, dangerously blaming people on the left for Kirk’s death, saying “millions” of liberal-leaning people were celebrating it. Many <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/republican-party\">Republicans</a> <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlie-kirk-they-killed-him_n_68c87873e4b04bfe9a6f63bb?origin=home-zone-d-unit\">had rushed to publicly blame Democrats </a>for Kirk’s death, even while the search for a suspect was still underway — and despite the fact that both people on the left and the right have been subjected to political violence and threats in recent years. </p>\n<p>“There is nothing left to talk about with the left. They hate us. They assassinated our nice guy who actually talked to them peacefully, debating ideas,” Greene said of Kirk. “Then millions on the left celebrated and made clear they want all of us dead.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n      <p/>\n      <i/>\n      <i>Decisions in Washington don’t just stay in Washington — they shape lives everywhere. HuffPost is committed to reporting on how policies affect real people. Support journalism that connects the dots.</i>\n      <a href=\"\">Join our membership program today.</a>\n    </blockquote>\n<p>“To be honest, I want a peaceful national divorce. Our country is too far gone and too far divided, and it’s no longer safe for any of us,” she continued, before adding: “Tighten your circle around your family and protect them at all times. I will pray for the left, but personally I want nothing to do with them.”</p>\n<p>Greene has called for a national divorce before. Back in 2021, the congresswoman suggested that people moving from blue states to red states should have a “cooling off period” before they’re able to vote.</p>\n<p>“All possible in a National Divorce scenario. After Democrat voters and big donors ruin a state like California, you would think it wise to stop them from doing it to another great state like Florida,” she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1476226398540816390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1476226398540816390%7Ctwgr%5E7d4e0e121359c42fee32adeffd8fd8de83b8f362%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2FTKkBA9X%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1\">wrote on X</a> at the time. “Brainwashed people that move from CA and NY really need a cooling off period.”</p>\n<p>And in 2023, she <a href=\"https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1627665203398688768\">wrote on X </a>that “we need a national divorce” and that “everyone I talk to says this.” </p>\n<p>She added, “From the sick and disgusting woke culture issues shoved down our throats to the [<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/democratic-party\">Democrats</a>’] traitorous America Last policies, we are done.”</p>\n<p>When Greene called for a national divorce in 2021, political commentator and journalist Mehdi Hasan called her out at the time in a TV segment on his then-network <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/msnbc\">MSNBC</a>, calling her a <a href=\"https://x.com/allinwithchris/status/1476730274260168733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">“serious threat to democracy.” </a></p>\n<p>Hasan pointed out that Greene, who represents Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, comes from a state that “tried a national divorce in the 1860s.”</p>\n<p>“Why? Georgia<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/causes-of-the-civil-war/\"> wanted to keep the institution of slavery</a>,” he said at the time. Georgia was the fifth out of the 11 Southern states to secede from the Union, following the election of President Abraham Lincoln. The Civil War followed.</p>\n<p>While Greene’s tweet on Monday called for a “peaceful” national divorce, one expert in political science emphasized that such a scenario would not be possible.</p>\n<p>“Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s renewed call for a ‘peaceful national divorce’ underscores a growing belief that red and blue America can no longer coexist,” <a href=\"https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/directory/ryan-griffiths\">Ryan Griffiths</a>, a political science professor at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, told HuffPost.</p>\n<p>“History shows such a divorce would not be peaceful,” he continued.</p>\n<h2>\n      <strong>History has shown that attempts to divide the country have often resulted in violence.</strong>\n    </h2>\n<p>Griffiths, author of “The Disunited States: Threats of Secession in Red and Blue America and Why They Won’t Work,” told HuffPost that the “idea that irreconcilable differences justify secession ignores the violent history of such efforts, including the Civil War, and overlooks the reality that Americans are deeply intermixed — politically, geographically and ideologically.”</p>\n<p>He said that while polarization is “real and worsening,” the solution is not to separate. It’s to find common ground.</p>\n<p>“Americans share more values than they realize, and it is our political leadership and not the people that is most polarized,” he said. “We need leaders who reject extremism, denounce violence, and work together to heal the divide before the call for divorce becomes a dangerous reality.”</p>\n<p>Griffiths emphasized that the U.S. “lacks the conditions for a clean split.” Then he added, “Any attempt to divide, based on what we’ve seen historically, would trigger cycles of violence, displacement, and lawlessness.”</p>\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n<p class=\"small text-muted mt-4\">\n  Source: <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-america-change-experts_n_68c9ab78e4b0765c82509d22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Read the full article</a>\n</p>"
